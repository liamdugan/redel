Having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing became the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The venues for the Games were concentrated around Beijing, its suburb Yanqing District, and Zhangjiakou, with some events (including the ceremonies and curling) repurposing venues originally built for Beijing 2008 (such as Beijing National Stadium and the Beijing National Aquatics Centre).\n\n\nThe Games featured a record 109 events across 15 disciplines, with big air freestyle skiing and women's monobob making their Olympic debuts as medal events, as well as several new mixed competitions. A total of 2,871 athletes representing 91 teams competed in the Games, with Haiti and Saudi Arabia making their Winter Olympic debut.\n\n\nBeijing's hosting of the Games was subject to various concerns and controversies including those related to human rights violations in China, such as the Uyghur genocide, which led to calls for a boycott of the games.[2][3] Like the Summer Olympics held six months earlier in Tokyo, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of health and safety protocols, and, for the second Games in a row, the Games being closed to the public (with selected events open to invited guests at a reduced capacity).\n\n\nNorway finished at the top of the medal table for the second successive Winter Olympics, winning a total of 37 medals, of which 16 were gold, setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics. The host nation China finished third with nine gold medals and also eleventh place by total medals won, marking its most successful performance in Winter Olympics history.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics\n\nThe bidding calendar was announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in October 2012, with the application deadline set for 14 November 2013.[5] The IOC Executive Board reviewed the bids from all applicant cities on 7 July 2014 and selected three cities, Oslo (Norway), Almaty (Kazakhstan), and Beijing (China), as the final candidates.[6]\n\n\nSeveral bid cities withdrew their bids during the process, citing the high costs or the lack of local support and funding for hosting the Games.[7] The Oslo bid, considered the clear frontrunner, was canceled in the wake of a series of revelations about the IOC's demands for luxury treatment of IOC members that strongly turned public opinion and the parliamentary majority against the bid. The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the Norwegian parliament had stated their intention to decline the application. In the days before the decision, Norwegian media had revealed the IOC's \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. The IOC also \"demanded control over all advertising space throughout Oslo\" to be used exclusively by IOC's sponsors, something that is not possible in Norway because the government doesn't own or control \"all advertising space throughout Oslo\" and has no authority to give a foreign private organization exclusive use of a city and the private property within it.[8] Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy; *Slate* described the IOC as a \"notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats.\"[9][10][11][12] Ole Berget, deputy minister in the Finance Ministry, said \"the IOC's arrogance was an argument held high by a lot of people.\"[13] The country's largest newspaper commented that \"Norway is a rich country, but we don't want to spend money on wrong things, like satisfying the crazy demands from IOC apparatchiks. These insane demands that they should be treated like the king of Saudi Arabia just won't fly with the Norwegian public.\"[13]\n\n\nBeijing was selected as the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics after beating Almaty by four votes on 31 July 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 Winter Olympics bidding results\n| City\n | Nation\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Beijing** | **![](image) China** | **44** |\n| Almaty | ![](image) Kazakhstan\n | 40\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The Big Air snowboarding and freestyle skiing events were held in a former industrial area in Shijingshan District, at Western Hills area.[18] Since the end of 2009, the Beijing Olympic Village apartments on the Olympic Green had been transformed into a residential area. There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the National Olympic Sports Center and will serves as Chinese Olympic Committee residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.[19]\n\n\nThe **Beijing National Stadium** was an iconic venue in the Beijing Zone, and it is also known as the **Bird's Nest** (鸟巢; *Niǎocháo*). The Beijing National Stadium was the site that hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the 2022 Winter Olympics, but it was no longer a venue for any competition in 2022.[20]\n\n\nThe **National Aquatics Center (**国家游泳中心 Guójiā Yóuyǒng Zhōngxīn /gwor-jyaa yoh-yong jong-sshin/), also known as the **Water Cube**, was the venue for Curling competition.[21] In the 2022 Winter Olympics, the National Aquatics Center became the first Olympic venue to incorporate a curling track in the swimming pool.[22]\n\n\nThe **Shougang Big Air** (首钢滑雪大跳台中心 Shǒugāng Huáxuě Dàtiàotái Zhōngxīn /shoh-gung hwaa-sshwair daa-tyao-teye jong-sshin/) was a newly constructed site for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[23] The Shougang Big Air hosted the freestyle skiing and snowboarding events.\n\n\nThe **Wukesong Sports Centre** (五棵松体育馆 Wǔkēsōng Tǐyùguǎn /woo-ker-song tee-yoo-gwan/) was under an 8-month renovation for the 2022 Winter Olympics. In February 2022, the Wukesong Sports Centre hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics Men's and Women's ice hockey tournaments.[24]\n\n\nThe **National Indoor Stadium** (国家体育馆 Guójiā Tǐyùguǎn /gwor-jyaa tee-yoo-gwan/) was the second venue for the ice hockey tournament for the 2022 Winter Olympics, besides the Wukesong Sports Centre.[25]\n\n\nThe **National Speed Skating Oval** (国家速滑馆 Guójiā Sùhuáguǎn /gwor-jyaa soo-hwaa-gwan/) has the nickname \"Ice Ribbon\" due to its exterior design. The National Speed Skating Oval was the venue for speed skating in the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nThe **Capital Indoor Stadium** (首都体育馆 Shǒudū Tǐyùguǎn), also known as the Capital Gymnasium, was a venue adapted from the 2008 Summer Olympics and was reconstructed for short-track speed skating and figure skating competitions in the 2022 Winter Olympics.[26]\n\n\n\n* Beijing National Stadium – opening, awarding and closing ceremonies / *80,000* **existing**\n* Beijing National Aquatics Centre – curling / *3,795* **renovated**\n* Beijing National Indoor Stadium – ice hockey / *19,418* **existing**\n* Beijing National Speed Skating Oval – speed skating / *11,950* **new**\n* Capital Indoor Stadium – figure skating, short track speed skating / *13,289* **existing**\n* Wukesong Sports Centre – ice hockey / *15,384* **existing**\n* Big Air Shougang – snowboarding (Big Air), freestyle skiing (Big Air) – *4,912* **new**\n* Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Village – **new**\n\n\nYanqing District is a suburban district localized at the Beijing's far north. Competitions for luge, skeleton, bobsleigh and alpine skiing were held in Xiaohaituo Mountain area in the West Dazhuangke village[27] of Zhangshanying in Yanqing District, northwest of the urban area of Beijing, 90 kilometres (56 miles) away from the city center of Beijing and 17.5 kilometres (10.9 miles) away from the town of Yanqing, using artificial snow because of the rarity of natural snow in this region.[28][29]\n\n\n\n* National Alpine Ski Centre (Rock, Ice River) – alpine skiing *4,800* **new**\n* National Sliding Centre – bobsleigh, luge, skeleton / *7,400* **new**\n* Yanqing Olympic Village / **new**\n\n\n#### Zhangjiakou Zone[edit]\n\n\nAll other skiing events were held in Taizicheng Area in Chongli District, Zhangjiakou city, Hebei province. It is 220 km (140 mi) from downtown Beijing and 130 km (81 mi) away from Xiaohaituo Mountain Area. The ski resort earned over ¥ 1.54 billion (US$237.77 million) in tourism during the 2015–16 winter season for a 31.6% growth over the previous season. In 2016, it was announced that Chongli received 2.185 million tourists, an increase of 30% from the previous season, during the first snow season after winning the Olympic bid. The snow season lasted for five months from November, during which Chongli has hosted thirty-six competitions and activities, such as Far East Cup and Children Skiing International Festival. A total of twenty-three skiing camps have also been set up, attracting the participation of 3,800 youths. All the venues construction started in November 2016 and was finished by the end of 2020 to enable the city to hold test events.[30][*needs update*]\n\n\n\n* Snow Ruyi – ski jumping, Nordic combined (ski jumping) *6,000*\n* National Biathlon Centre – biathlon *6,024*\n* Genting Snow Park\n\t+ Park A – Ski and snowboard cross *1,774*\n\t+ Park B – Halfpipe and Slopestyle (freestyle skiing and snowboard) *2,550*\n\t+ Park C – Aerials and Moguls *1,597*\n* National Cross-Country Centre – Nordic combined (cross-country), cross-country *6,023*\n* Zhangjiakou Olympic Village\n* Zhangjiakou Medals Plaza\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Olympic medal\n\nThe design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 26 October 2021. The concept is based on the 2008 Summer Olympics medals and Chinese astronomy and astrology as the games were held coinciding with the Chinese New Year festivities.[31]\n\n\nThe uniforms for medal presenters at medal ceremonies were unveiled in January 2022.[32] The uniforms have been designed in a joint project by the Central Academy of Fine Arts and Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology.[32]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Winter Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)A torch serves as the cauldron in Yanqing\nThe torch relay started on 18 October 2021 in Greece. On 20 October 2021, it was announced that the local leg would start on 2 February and end on 4 February 2022 during the Opening Ceremonies. The local leg only visited two cities: Beijing and Zhangjiakou.[33] Activists staged a protest at the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in Greece.[34]\n\n\nThe inclusion and television appearance of Qi Fabao, a People's Liberation Army commander well known in China for his involvement in the 2020–2021 China–India skirmishes, as one of 1,200 torchbearers have been controversial, with India launching a diplomatic boycott of the Games as a result.[35]\n\n\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Summer Olympics § Biosecurity protocols, COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China, and Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports\n\n![](image)Buses serving the Olympic bubble have red stickers on front and rear\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in the qualifying process for curling and women's ice hockey due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an Olympic Qualification Event that completed the field (in place of points earned across the 2020 and 2021 World Curling Championships). The IIHF based its qualification for the women's tournament upon existing IIHF World Rankings, without holding the 2020 Women's World Championship.[36][37]\n\n\nOn 29 September 2021, the IOC announced biosecurity protocols for the Games; all athletes were required to remain within the bio-secure bubble (referred to as a \"closed-loop management system\") for the duration of their participation, which included daily COVID-19 testing, and only being allowed to travel to and from Games-related venues. Unless they are fully-vaccinated or have a valid medical exemption, all athletes were required to quarantine for 21 days upon their arrival. Mirroring a protocol adopted for the 2020 Summer Olympics before they were moved behind closed doors, the IOC also announced that only residents of the People's Republic of China would be permitted to attend the Games as spectators.[38][39]\n\n\nOn 23 December 2021, the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) announced that they had agreed to withdraw their players' participation in the Games' men's hockey tournament, citing concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up games that had been postponed due to COVID-19 outbreak[40] As part of their latest collective agreement with the NHLPA, the NHL had agreed to accommodate a break for the Olympics and player participation for the first time since 2014.[41]\n\n\nOn 17 January 2022, amid increasing lockdowns across China and the first detected case of the Omicron variant in Beijing, it was announced that ticket sales to the general public were cancelled, and that limited numbers of spectators would be admitted by invitation only. These, therefore, became the second Olympics in a row that were closed to the general public.[42] In the lead-up to the Games, organizers stated that they had aimed for at least 30% capacity at each venue, divided equally between spectators from within the \"closed loop\" (including dignitaries, delegations, and the press), and invited guests from outside of it (including local residents, school students, winter sports enthusiasts, and marketing partners). At least 150,000 spectators from outside the \"closed loop\" were expected to attend. Spectators were only present at events held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou; all events in Yanqing were held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted.[43][44]\n\n\nEveryone present at the Games, including athletes, staff, and attendees, were required to use the My2022 mobile app as part of the biosecurity protocols, which was used for submissions of customs declarations and health records for travel to the Games, daily health self-reporting, and records of COVID-19 vaccination and testing. The app also provided news and information relating to the Games, and messaging functions. Concerns were raised about the security of the My2022 app and how information collected by it would be used, so several delegations advised their athletes to bring burner phones and laptops for the duration of the games.[45][46]\n\n\nBecause of the strict COVID-19 protocol, some top athletes, considered to be medal contenders, were not able to travel to China after having tested positive, even if asymptomatic. The cases included Austrian ski jumper Marita Kramer, the leader of the World Cup ranking,[47] and Russian skeletonist Nikita Tregubov, silver medalist of the 2018 Winter Olympics.[48]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)G6 Beijing–Lhasa Expressway and Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway connect Beijing with Zhangjiakou.\n![](image)CR400BF-C-5162 had been converted to a dedicated train for the Winter Olympics.\nThe new Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway opened in late 2019, starting from Beijing North railway station and ending at Zhangjiakou railway station. It was built for speeds of up to 350 km/h (220 mph); with this new road system, the travel time from Beijing to Zhangjiakou was decreased to around 50 minutes. A dedicated train for the Winter Olympics began to run on this line in January 2022, featuring a mobile television studio that supports live broadcast on the train.[49]\n\n\nOn December 31, 2021, the Beijing Subway reached the planned 783 km (487 mi) at the bid book.[50]\n\n\nPlanned before the city was awarded the rights to the Games, the Beijing Daxing International Airport opened in 2019, and due to the strategic location, it would be the main focus for the arrival and entry of delegations on Chinese soil. Chinese officials had hoped that this airport would replace Beijing Capital International Airport as the country's main hub for arrivals and departures between its opening and the Winter Games and reduce the international and domestic demands of the older airport. This airport replaced the old Beijing Nanyuan Airport which was out of date and was on the list of the most dangerous airports in the world because of its location and since its opening, it has been sharing the local and international demands of the city and the country with the older Beijing Capital International Airport.[51] However, according to the COVID-19 pandemic security protocol manual issued by BOCWOG and International Olympic Committee, all foreign delegations could only enter and leave Beijing via the Capital International Airport due to its smaller size and the fact that it is closer to the city center and Olympic Green and has specific isolation areas and a better health protocols.[52]\n\n\n\n### Budget[edit]\n\n\nThe original estimated budget for the Games was US$3.9 billion, less than one-tenth of the $43 billion spent on the 2008 Summer Olympics.[53] Although there were reports that the games might cost more than US$38.5 billion,[54] the final official budget was US$2.24 billion and turning a profit of $52 million, of which the International Olympic Committee (IOC) donated $10.4 million of that surplus to the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) to help with the development of sport in China.[55][56]\n\n\n\n## Ceremonies[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Winter Olympics countdown clock at Wangfujing Dept Store\n![](image)A scene from the opening ceremony; in lieu of a cauldron, the Olympic torch was mounted in the centre of a large snowflake sculpture\nThe opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 4 February 2022 at Beijing National Stadium.\n\n\nAmid the political controversies and tensions impacting the Games, IOC president Thomas Bach instructed athletes to \"show how the world would look like, if we all respect the same rules and each other\", and pledged that \"there [would] be no discrimination for any reason whatsoever.\"[57]\n\n\nThe final seven torchbearers reflected multiple decades of Chinese athletes, beginning with the 1950s, and concluding with two skiers competing in the Games—21 year-old skier Zhao Jiawen from Shanxi (the first Chinese athlete to compete in Nordic combined), and 20-year-old Dinigeer Yilamujiang from the Xinjiang autonomous region (cross-country, and the first Chinese cross-country skier to win a medal in an ISF event).[58][59]\n\n\nFor the first time in Olympic history, the final torchbearers did not light a cauldron: instead, they fitted the torch into the centre of a large stylised snowflake, constructed from placards bearing the names of the delegations competing in the Games.[59] Three similar snowflakes were also erected as public flames, with one outside of the stadium lit by a volunteer, one in Yanqing District lit by speed skater Yu Jongjun, and the third in Zhangjiakou lit by skier Wang Wezhuo.[58]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics was held at Beijing National Stadium on 20 February 2022; it included a cultural presentation, closing remarks, and the formal handover to Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo as hosts of the 2026 Winter Olympics.[60]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics include a record 109 events over 15 disciplines in seven sports.[61] There are seven new medal events, including men's and women's big air freestyle, women's monobob, mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross, and the mixed relay in short track speed skating.[62]\n\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each discipline.*\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Alpine skiing (11) (details)\n* ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n* ![](image) Bobsleigh (4) (details)\n* ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n* ![](image) Curling (3) (details)\n* ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n* ![](image) Freestyle skiing (13) (details)\n* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n* ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n* ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n* ![](image) Short track speed skating (9) (details)\n* ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n* ![](image) Ski jumping (5) (details)\n* ![](image) Snowboarding (11) (details)\n* ![](image) Speed skating (14) (details)\n\n### New events[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2016, the International Ski Federation (FIS) announced plans to begin permitting women's competitions in Nordic combined, to contest the discipline at the Olympic level for the first time in Beijing.[63] In November 2017, a further three events were put forward by the FIS for possible Olympic inclusion: a ski jumping mixed team competition and men's and women's big air in freestyle skiing.[64] At their May 2018 Congress at the Costa Navarino resort in Messenia, Greece, the FIS submitted several additional events for consideration, including a proposal to make telemark skiing an Olympic discipline for the first time in Beijing, with proposed competitions to include the men's and women's parallel sprint and a mixed team parallel sprint. The Congress also approved to submit the aerials mixed team event, and several new snowboarding events: the men and women's snowboard cross team event; a mixed team alpine parallel event; the men's and women's parallel special slalom; and a mixed team parallel special slalom event.[65] The individual parallel special slalom events were featured at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, but were dropped from the Olympic program in 2018 to make way for the snowboarding big air competitions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe International Luge Federation (FIL) proposed the addition of six new events, including natural track luge (men's and women's singles), a women's doubles competition on the artificial track, and sprint events (men, women, and doubles) on the artificial track.[66][67]\n\n\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) continued to campaign for the addition of synchronized skating as a new event within the discipline of figure skating.[68] The ISU also proposed a new mixed team event in short track speed skating.[66]\n\n\nIn biathlon, a single mixed relay was proposed by the International Biathlon Union (IBU) to complement the four-person mixed relay that featured at the 2018 Winter Olympics.[66] Also, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) proposed a new team event, but there was no plan to introduce a four-woman bobsleigh event despite the recommendation from the federation's executive board to propose such an event in the interests of gender equality.[66]\n\n\nIn July 2018, the IOC announced changes to the program for the 2022 Winter Olympics as part of a goal to increase the participation of women, and appeal to younger audiences. Seven new medal events were added (expanding the total program to 109 events), including men's and women's big air freestyle, women's monobob, mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross, and the mixed relay in short track speed skating.[69] Women's Nordic combined was not added; Nordic combined remains the only Winter Olympic sport only contested by men.[70]\n\n\n\n## Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they were not permitted to compete in team sports. WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) again, as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country.[71][72][73] Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision.[74]\n\n\nAfter reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate in the Olympics and other international events, but for two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team.\" The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation.[75]\n\n\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. Russia would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.[76]\n\n\nOn 8 September 2021, the IOC Executive Board suspended the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) through at least the end of 2022 for violations of the Olympic Charter, over its refusal to send athletes to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo due to COVID-19 pandemic-related concerns. North Korean athletes would be allowed to participate under the Olympic flag.[77][78][79][80] However, North Korean Ministry of Sports and the National Olympic Committee said in a letter to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, the Chinese Olympic Committee, and the General Administration of Sport of China on 7 January 2022 that \"Due to the \"action of hostile forces\" and the COVID-19 pandemic, they would not be able to participate in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\"[81] In addition, the North Korean Olympic Committee said \"supports all the work of our comrades in China to host a grand and wonderful Olympics. The United States and its followers are plotting anti-Chinese conspiracies to obstruct the successful hosting of the Olympics, but this is an insult to the spirit of the Olympic Charter and an act to damage China's international image. We firmly oppose and reject these actions.\"[82]\n\n\nThe following 91 National Olympic Committees have qualified athletes (two fewer than four years earlier), with Haiti and Saudi Arabia making their Winter Olympic débuts.[83][84] Kenya qualified one athlete, but withdrew.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2022 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the Winter Olympics\nThe

2022 Winter Olympics\nFor a more comprehensive list, see 2022 Winter Olympics medal table.\n\nNorway finished at the top of the medal table for the second successive Winter Olympics, winning a total of 37 medals, of which 16 were gold, setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics.[4] Germany finished second with 12 golds and 27 medals overall, and the host nation China finished third with nine gold medals, marking their most successful performance in Winter Olympics history.[4] The team representing the ROC ended up with the second largest number of medals won at the Games, with 32, but finished ninth on the medal table, as only six gold medals were won by the delegation. Traditional Winter powerhouse Canada; despite having won 26 medals, only four of them were gold, resulting in a finish outside the top ten in the medal table for the first time since 1988 (34 years).[182][183]\n\n\n\n  \\*   Host nation (China)\n\n\n\n2022 Winter Olympics medal table[184]| Rank | NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Norway | 16 | 8 | 13 | 37 |\n| 2 | ![](image) Germany | 12 | 10 | 5 | 27 |\n| 3 | ![](image) United States | 9 | 9 | 7 | 25 |\n| 4 | ![](image) China\\* | 9 | 4 | 2 | 15 |\n| 5 | ![](image) Sweden | 8 | 5 | 5 | 18 |\n| 6 | ![](image) Netherlands | 8 | 5 | 4 | 17 |\n| 7 | ![](image) Austria | 7 | 7 | 4 | 18 |\n| 8 | ![](image) Switzerland | 7 | 2 | 6 | 15 |\n| 9 | ![](image) ROC | 5 | 12 | 15 | 32 |\n| 10 | ![](image) France | 5 | 7 | 2 | 14 |\n| 11–29 | Remaining | 23 | 40 | 47 | 110 |\n| Totals (29 entries) | 109 | 109 | 110 | 328 |\n\n\n### Podium sweeps[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Sport\n | Event\n | Team\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 15 February\n | Bobsleigh | Two-man bob | ![](image) Germany | Francesco FriedrichThorsten Margis | Johannes LochnerFlorian Bauer | Christoph HaferMatthias Sommer | [185] |\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Winter Olympics marketing\n\n### Emblem[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Flower bed along Chang'an Avenue.\nThe emblem for the 2022 Winter Olympics, \"Winter Dream\" (冬梦), was unveiled on 15 December 2017 at the Beijing National Aquatics Center. Designed by Lin Cunzhen (who previously designed the emblem of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing), the emblem is a stylized rendition of the Chinese character for winter (冬) as a multi-coloured ribbon, reflecting upon the landscapes of the host region. The beginning of the ribbon symbolizes an ice skater, while the end of the ribbon symbolizes a skier. The emblem carries a blue, red, and yellow colour scheme: the latter two colours represent both the flag of China, and \"passion, youth, and vitality\".[186]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon\n\nBing Dwen Dwen was the mascot of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Bing Dwen Dwen was chosen from thousands of Chinese designs in 35 countries worldwide. \"Bing\" (冰) means ice in Chinese, and was meant to suggest purity and strength. \"Dwen Dwen\" (墩墩) was meant to suggest robustness, liveliness, and youth. Bing Dwen Dwen's astronaut-like clothes implied that the Winter Olympics embraced new technologies and created possibilities.[187]\n\n\n\n### Slogan[edit]\n\n\nThe Games' official slogan, \"Together for a Shared Future\" (Chinese: 一起向未来; pinyin: *Yīqǐ xiàng wèilái*), was announced on 17 September 2021; organisers stated that the slogan was intended to reflect \"the power of the Games to overcome global challenges as a community\".[188]\n\n\nThe slogan was compared in media with Chinese leader Xi Jinping's policy slogan: 'Building the Common Future of Humanity'.[189]\n\n\n\n## Viewership[edit]\n\n\n* Independent research conducted on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recorded 2.01 billion viewers across television and digital platforms.[190][191]\n* A total of 713 billion minutes of coverage was watched on various Olympic Media Rights Partners’ channels, which represents an 18 per cent increase when comparing with the last Winter Olympics.[192]\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2022 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nIn China, domestic rights to these Games were owned by China Central Television (CCTV), with rights being sublicensed by China Mobile's Migu streaming service.[193] In some countries, broadcast rights to the 2022 Winter Olympics were already agreed upon through existing long-term deals. In France and the United Kingdom, these were the first Games where Eurosport would be the main rightsholder; the BBC sub-licensed a limited amount of coverage on free-to-air television, as part of a deal in which the BBC sold the pay-TV rights to the 2018 and 2020 Games to Eurosport.[194][195] In January 2022, the BBC announced it would broadcast over 300 hours of free-to-air live coverage, as well as highlights programmes.[196][197]\n\n\nThe scheduling of the Games impacted the U.S. broadcast rights to the Super Bowl since this is the first time that the Super Bowl had been held during the Winter Olympics (and the second time that both events had been held in the same year on NBC), the championship game of the National Football League (NFL) and historically the most-watched television broadcast in the United States annually. The rights to the Games rotate between CBS, Fox, and long-time Olympic broadcaster NBC; to prevent the Games from competing for viewership and advertising sales with Super Bowl LVI—which was scheduled for 13 February 2022 at Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium—CBS and NBC announced in March 2019 that they would invert the rights for Super Bowl LVI and LV (2021), so that both the 2022 Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LVI would be broadcast by NBC.[198][199] In a break from the established practice of airing premieres or special episodes of entertainment programmes after the Super Bowl to take advantage of its large audience, NBC aired its prime time coverage for Day 10 of the Games immediately following Super Bowl LVI.[200] Furthermore, the NFL's new media rights beginning in 2023 extends the Super Bowl rotation to four networks by adding ABC, thus codifying this scenario by giving NBC rights to the Super Bowl in 2026, 2030, and 2034.[201][202]\n\n\nThese Games also confirmed an ongoing trend in U.S. viewership of the Olympics; while television viewership had seen a further decline, they were offset by increases in social media engagement and streaming viewership of the Games. Similar trends were seen in Europe, where Eurosport reported an eight-fold increase in streaming viewership on its platforms and Discovery+ over Pyeongchang 2018.[203][204][205]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Demonstration of Tibetans and Uyghurs in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin against the Olympic Games in Beijing 2022\n![](image)Protest by Tibetan independence groups against Chinese Winter Olympics (2022) held in Lausanne at the headquarters of the IOC\nDuring the bidding process, critics questioned the Beijing bid, arguing that the proposed outdoor venue sites do not have reliable snowfall in winter for snow sports. Concerns have been raised that snow may need to be transported to the venues at great cost and with uncertain environmental consequences.[206][207]\n\n\nAdditional concerns about weather conditions were raised during certain events. Swedish athlete Frida Karlsson nearly collapsed after the women's skiathlon due to low temperatures.[208] Afterwards, the Swedes considered putting in a request for races to be moved to earlier in the day, stating that the afternoons and early evenings scheduled for European TV audiences were hurting the performance of the athletes.[209]\n\n\nAs in 2008, activists, human rights groups, and diplomats made calls to boycott the Olympic Games when hosted by China. In the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the Xinjiang papers, the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, and the Uyghur genocide,[210][211] calls were made for a boycott of the 2022 Games.[212][213][214] Because of these issues, the selection of an athlete from Xinjiang as part of the final torchbearers received a mixed reaction.[215][216][59]\n\n\nIn February 2021, the Chinese Communist Party-owned tabloid *Global Times* warned that China could \"seriously sanction any country that follows a boycott.\"[217][218] In March 2021, Chinese spokesperson Guo Weimin stated that any attempt to boycott the Olympics would be doomed to fail.[219] China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi also told the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell that they should attend the games to \"enhance exchanges on winter sport\", and to \"foster new highlights\" in bilateral cooperation.[220]\n\n\nThe IOC stated that it remains neutral in all global political issues and that the award of hosting the games does not signal agreement with the host country's political or social situation or its human rights standards. The committee's response to Agence France-Presse read: \"We've repeatedly said it: the IOC isn't responsible for the government. It only gives the rights and opportunity for the staging of the Olympic Games. That doesn't mean we agree with all the politics, all the social or human rights issues in the country. And it doesn't mean we approve of all the human rights violations of a person or people.\" The statement attracted criticism, with Pacific University professor Jules Boykoff accusing the IOC of \"hypocrisy\".[220]\n\n\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, *The New York Times* published a report alleging that China requested Russia to delay the invasion until after the Olympics to avoid damaging the Games' public image.[221] Russia invaded Ukraine just 4 days after the Games' Closing Ceremony. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, has rejected the claims as \"speculations without any basis, and intended to blame-shift and smear China\".[222]\n\n\n\n### American diplomatic boycott[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics § Diplomatic boycotts or non-attendance\n\nThe United States boycott of China's Winter Olympics was predominantly due to China's human rights issues on topics such as the systematic oppression of the Uyghurs, Tibetans and the riots in Hong Kong in 2019.[223] The Chinese government implemented many coercive activities in those regions, such as the reeducation camps, mass detention camps, and restricted access to social media.\n\n\n\n#### Key event timeline[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2018, American senator Marco Rubio, Senator Jeff Merkley, and Congressmen Jim McGovern and Chris Smith sent a letter, on behalf of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requesting the revocation of China's host right on the 2022 Winter Olympics.[224] The letter stated that \"no Olympics should be held in a country whose government is committing genocide and crimes against humanity.\"\n\n\nIn November 2021, President Biden proposed \"a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\"[225] The United States was aware of the prospective harsh punishment of being suspended by the National Olympic Committee and was careful regarding the scale and severity of the boycott.[225]\n\n\nIn December 2021, the Biden administration officially initiated a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, restricting United States government officials' presence at the games.[226] The attendance of Team USA athletes was not affected by the diplomatic boycott.\n\n\n\n#### Reactions[edit]\n\n\nThe IOC remained relatively neutral regarding the letter from CECC or the boycott.[227] The IOC negotiated with the Chinese government on specific protocols to ensure the Olympic Games ran smoothly, such as providing unrestricted internet access to foreign journalists.[228]\n\n\nFrom China's perspective, the United States was \"politicizing sports\" with the Biden Boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.[229] The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, accused the United States of violating the spirit of political neutrality endorsed in the Olympic Charter, emphasizing that an Olympic game should not be a place for political posturing and manipulation.[230] China announced that the United States was not yet officially invited by the host committee; thus, the United States should not have initiated the boycott in the first place.[231]\n\n\nFollowing the United States, many countries in the Western world decided to join the diplomatic boycott to show disapproval of China's human rights issues.[228]\n\n\n\n### Environmental impact[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics § Environmental and health issues\n\nAn estimated 49 million US gallons (190,000,000 L; 41,000,000 imp gal) of water was expected to be used to create snow at the various venues. Pyeongchang, South Korea, which held the previous Winter Olympics, also had a cold but similarly arid climate that required vast quantities of artificial snow. Professor Carmen de Jong, a geographer at the University of Strasbourg, argued that these would be the \"most unsustainable\" Winter Olympics in history. The IOC stated that \"a series of water-conserving and recycling designs have been put into place to optimize water usage for snowmaking, human consumption, and other purposes.[232][*needs update*]\n\n\nArtificial snow forms a harder piste compared to real snow. It is often favoured by professionals for being fast and \"hyper-grippy\" but also raises their fear of falling on it.[232][233] American snowboarder Jamie Anderson compared it to \"pretty bulletproof ice\" while her teammate Courtney Rummel compared it to the man-made snow in Wisconsin.[233]\n\n\nAccording to Jules Boykoff in February 2022, Beijing's electricity came largely from coal and this coal power was what supported the construction of some Olympic venues. To offset emissions from construction and air travel, China had planted roughly 60 million trees.[234]\n\n\n\n### Sporting controversies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics § Sporting controversies\n\nThere were concerns about decisions and disqualification in several events during the games. These issues included the following: \n\n\n\n* An official appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over the disqualification of two South Korean athletes from the men's 1000 metres short track speed skating event filed by the Korean Sport & Olympic Committee, after having their protests rejected by the International Skating Union.[235][236][237]\n* Controversy surrounding a ruling of an obstruction in the 5000 metres relay event.[238]\n* A potential missed call by judges during the men's snowboard slopestyle and men's half pipe event events.[239][240][241][242]\n* A ruling of a false start in the men's 500 metres speed skating event.[243]\n* The disqualification of racers for their uniforms during the mixed team normal hill event of ski jumping.\n* The continued participation of a figure skater Kamila Valieva in the women's singles competition after a preliminary positive drug test from a sample 2 months prior.[244]\n* Three athletes failed the doping test during the Olympics and were suspended: Iranian alpine skier Hossein Saveh-Shemshaki, Ukrainian cross-country skier Valiantsina Kaminskaya, and Ukrainian bobsledder Lidiia Hunko.[245] The positive test of the Spanish figure skater Laura Barquero was announced after the Olympics.[246][247]\n* U.S. skater Joey Mantia alleged that South Korean skater Lee Seung-hoon made contact with him and pulled him back, preventing him from winning a bronze medal in the Mass Start final. Mantia lost by a 0.002-second margin. Team USA challenged the result, but Lee was awarded the bronze medal.[248][249][250]\n\n\n### Athlete and officials complaints[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics § Athletes and team officials complaints\n\nThe food and overall conditions in quarantine hotels given to athletes testing positive for COVID-19 were criticised early on.[251][252] Team officials from delegations including Belgium, Germany, Poland, Finland and the Russian Olympic Committee all brought up issues their athletes faced in quarantine hotels, among them were the lack of internet connections, low-quality food, insufficient facilities and no training equipment.[253][254][255]\n\n\nWith China's Zero-COVID policy, there were issues raised about the process of quarantine at the games.[251] On 2 February, Belgian skeleton athlete Kim Meylemans posted on social media and was in tears about the conditions she faced while in quarantine.[256][257] According to *Newsweek* and *Time*, the hotels' conditions appeared to have improved after the athletes' complaints were made public.[252][258]\n\n\nThere were some complaints about the food served outside of quarantine. Germany's alpine coach Christian Schweiger called the catering \"extremely questionable\" for not having hot meals but he echoed athletes from several nations that the food at the nearby Athletes' Village was great.[259] The US and South Korean teams elected to bring their own food.[260] Austrian skier Matthias Mayer said that Kitzbuehel would have offered \"the best of the best\" but also that a hot meal right before a race might not bring out top performances.[259][261]\n\n\nOther complaints included low temperatures and related safety concerns. Sweden's Frida Karlsson nearly collapsed at the conclusion of the women's skiathlon cross-country race. Afterwards, her team considered requesting that races held in afternoons and evenings for European TV audiences be moved to earlier during the day.[209][208] Some athletes resorted to putting tape on their faces and noses to protect them from the bitter cold.[262] Heavy snowfall disrupted a number of competition and training events on 13 February. Thirty-three skiers did not finish their first run of the men's giant slalom. Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway said that he \"couldn't see shit.\" Switzerland's Loic Meillard said, \"It's not what I was hoping for but it's part of the game ... we've raced in conditions like that before.\"[263]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2022 Winter Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in China\n\t+ 2008 Summer Olympics – Beijing\n\t+ 2014 Summer Youth Olympics – Nanjing\n\t+ 2022 Winter Olympics – Beijing\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* List of Olympic Games boycotts\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Xi Jinping is current China's nominal head of state, serving as Chinese president.

This marked the second time that South Korea had hosted the Olympic Games (having previously hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul), as well as the first time it hosted the Winter Olympics. The 2018 Games marked the third time that an Asian country had hosted the Winter Olympics, after Sapporo 1972 and Nagano 1998, both in Japan. It was also the first Winter Olympics held in mainland Asia, and the first of three consecutive Olympic Games held in East Asia, preceding the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan and the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics in China.\n\n\nThe 2018 Games featured 102 events over 15 disciplines, a record number of events for the Winter Games. This is the first edition in Winter Olympic Games history to feature more than 100 medal events, four of which made their Olympic debut in 2018: \"big air\" snowboarding, mass start speed skating, mixed doubles curling, and mixed team alpine skiing. A total of 2,914 athletes from 93[note 1] teams competed, with the national debuts of Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.\n\n\nAfter a state-sponsored doping program was exposed following the 2014 Winter Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee was suspended, but selected athletes were allowed to compete neutrally under the special IOC designation of \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR), provided they could meet certain anti-doping requirements. North Korea agreed to participate in the Games in spite of tense relations with South Korea. The two nations paraded together at the opening ceremony as a unified Korea, and fielded a unified team (COR) in the women's ice hockey.\n\n\nSouth Korea ranked seventh overall at the 2018 Winter Games, with five gold medals and 17 overall medals. South Korea has traditionally been a country that won many medals in short track speed skating, but in this competition, it also won medals in skeleton racing, curling and skiing. South Korea's Yun Sung-Bin won a gold medal in men's skeleton racing, the first Olympic gold ever won by Asia in the sledding event. Norway led the total medal tally with 39, followed by Germany at 31 and Canada at 29.[1] Germany and Norway were tied for the highest number of gold medals, both winning 14.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding and election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Pyeongchang's award card, announced by the IOC's honorary president Jacques Rogge\n![](image)Woljeongsa in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do\n![](image)Sangwonsa in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do\nPyeongchang was elected as the host city at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa, on 6 July 2011, earning the necessary majority of at least 48 votes in just one round of voting.[2] Winning 63 of the 95 votes cast in the first secret ballot, Pyeongchang received more votes than its competitors combined, overwhelmingly beating Munich in Germany, which received 25 votes, and Annecy in France, which received seven.[3][4]\n\n\nThis was South Korea's third consecutive bid for the Winter Olympics, having been defeated by Vancouver and Sochi respectively in the final rounds of voting for the 2010 and 2014 Games.[3] Earlier, PyeongChang lost to Vancouver with a difference of 3 votes in bidding the 2010 Olympics, and lost to Sochi with a difference of 4 votes in bidding the 2014 Olympics. Since then, South Korea made great progress in preparing to host the Winter Olympics and succeeded in hosting the 2018 Olympics after three challenges.[4]\n\n\nAfter winning the election, Pyeongchang became the third Asian city to host the Winter Olympics.[2][3] Also, South Korea became the second country in Asia to host both the Summer (1988 Seoul Olympics) and Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Winter Olympics bidding results[5]\n| City\n | Nation\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Pyeongchang** | **![](image) South Korea** | **63** |\n| Munich | ![](image) Germany | 25\n |\n| Annecy | ![](image) France | 7\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\n![Pyeongchang is located in South Korea](image)![Pyeongchang](image)\nPyeongchang\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Pyeongchang in South Korea\n\nOn 5 August 2011, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the formation of the Pyeongchang 2018 Coordination Commission.[6][7] On 4 October 2011, it was announced that the Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympics would be headed by Kim Jin-sun. The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues.[8] The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village.[9][10] In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul.[11]\n\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee met for an orientation with the Pyeongchang 2018 organizing committee in July 2012.[12] Then-IOC President Jacques Rogge visited Pyeongchang for the first time in February 2013.[13]\n\n\nThe Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games created Pyeongchang WINNERS in 2014 by recruiting university students living in South Korea to spread awareness of the Olympic Games through social networking services and news articles.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)2018 Olympics gold medal\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nThe design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 21 September 2017. Created by Lee Suk-woo, the design features a pattern of diagonal ridges on both sides, with the Olympic rings on the front, and the obverse showing the 2018 Olympics' emblem, the event name and the discipline. The edge of each medal is marked with extrusions of hangul alphabets, while the ribbons are made from a traditional South Korean textile.[15] Gold medals contained 99 percent of silver and 1 percent of gold, which is a traditional composition for Olympic gold medals. At 586 grams (20.7 oz) they were the heaviest medals in the Olympic history.[16][17]\n\n\n\n![](image)2018 Winter Olympics torch\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics torch relay\n\nThe torch relay started on 24 October 2017 in Greece and lasted for 101 days, ending at the start of the Olympics on 9 February 2018. The Olympic torch entered South Korea on 1 November 2017. There were 7,500 torch bearers to represent the combined Korean population of approximately 75 million people. There were also 2,018 support runners to guard the torch and act as messengers.\n\n\nThe torch and its bearers traveled by a diverse means of transportation, including by turtle ship in Hansando Island, sailboat on the Baengmagang River in Buyeo, marine cable car in Yeosu, zip-wire over Bamseom Island, steam train in the Gokseong Train Village, marine rail bike along the east coast in Samcheok, and by yacht in Busan Metropolitan City.\n\n\nThere were also robot torch relays in Jeju and Daejeon.[18]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic venues 2018\nMain article: Venues of the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Dragon Valley (Alpensia) Ski Resort\n![](image)Alpensia Resort and wind turbines in Pyeongchang\nMost of the outdoor snow events were held in the county of Pyeongchang, while some of the alpine skiing events took place in the neighboring county of Jeongseon. The indoor ice events were held in the nearby city of Gangneung.\n\n\n\n#### Pyeongchang (mountain cluster)[edit]\n\n\nThe Alpensia Sports Park in Daegwallyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang, was the focus of the 2018 Winter Olympics.[19][20] It was home to the Olympic Stadium,[21] the Olympic Village and most of the outdoor sports venues.\n\n\n\n* Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre – ski jumping, Nordic combined, snowboarding (big air)\n* Alpensia Biathlon Centre – biathlon\n* Alpensia Cross-Country Skiing Centre – cross-country skiing, Nordic combined\n* Alpensia Sliding Centre – luge, bobsleigh, skeleton\n* Yongpyong Alpine Centre – alpine skiing (slalom, giant slalom)\n\n\nAdditionally, a stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in Bongpyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang:\n\n\n\n* Phoenix Snow Park – freestyle skiing, snowboarding\n\n\nAnother stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in neighboring Jeongseon county:\n\n\n\n* Jeongseon Alpine Centre – alpine skiing (downhill, super-G, combined)\n\n\n#### Gangneung (coastal cluster)[edit]\n\n\nThe Gangneung Olympic Park, in the neighborhood of Gyo-dong in Gangneung city, includes four indoor sports venues, all in close proximity to one another.\n\n\n\n* Gangneung Hockey Centre – ice hockey (men's competition)\n* Gangneung Curling Centre – curling\n* Gangneung Oval[21] – long track speed skating\n* Gangneung Ice Arena – short track speed skating, figure skating\n\n\nIn addition, a stand-alone indoor sports venue was located in the grounds of Catholic Kwandong University.\n\n\n\n* Kwandong Hockey Centre – ice hockey (women's competition)\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nTicket prices for the 2018 Winter Olympics were announced in April 2016 and tickets went on sale in October 2016. Event tickets ranged in price from ₩20,000 South Korean won (approx. US$17) to ₩900,000 (~US$787) while tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies ranged from ₩220,000 (~US$192) to ₩1.5 million (~US$1311). The exact prices were determined through market research; around 50% of the tickets were expected to cost about ₩80,000 (~US$70) or less, and tickets in sports that are relatively unknown in the region, such as biathlon and luge, were made cheaper in order to encourage attendance. By contrast, figure skating and the men's ice hockey gold-medal game carried the most expensive tickets of the Games.[22]\n\n\nAs of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold.[23][24] However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold.[25]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Parade of Nations at 2018 Olympic opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018. The US$100 million facility was only intended to be used for the opening and closing ceremonies of these Olympics and the subsequent Paralympics; it was demolished following their conclusion.[26][27][28]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics featured 102 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports,[29] making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Six new events in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic program in Pyeongchang: men's and ladies' big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling, men's and ladies' mass start speed skating, and mixed team alpine skiing.[29][30]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Winter Olympic sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n* Bobsledding\n\t+ ![](image) Bobsleigh (3) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n* ![](image) Curling (3) (details)\n* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n | * ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n* Skating\n\t+ ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Short track speed skating (8) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Speed skating (14) (details)\n | * Skiing\n\t+ ![](image) Alpine skiing (11) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Freestyle skiing (10) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Ski jumping (4) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Snowboarding (10) (details)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.*\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record total of 93[note 1] teams qualified at least one athlete to compete in the Games. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Six nations made their Winter Olympics debuts: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.[31] Athletes from three further countries – the Cayman Islands, Dominica, and Peru – qualified to compete, but all three National Olympic Committees returned the quota spots back to the International Ski Federation (FIS).[32]\n\n\nUnder a historic agreement facilitated by the IOC, qualified athletes from North Korea were allowed to cross the Korean Demilitarized Zone into South Korea to compete in the Games.[33][34][35] The two nations marched together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][37] A unified Korean team, consisting of 12 players from North Korea and 23 from South Korea, competed in the women's ice hockey tournament under a special IOC country code designation (COR) following talks in Panmunjom on 17 January 2018.[36] The two nations also participated separately: the South Korea team competed in every sport, while the North Korea team competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and short track speed skating.[38]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended due to the Russian doping scandal and the investigation into the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Individual Russian athletes, who qualified and could demonstrate they had complied with the IOC's doping regulations, were given the option to compete at the 2018 Games as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) under the Olympic flag and with the Olympic anthem played at any ceremony.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the

Korea and South Korea formed a unified Korean women's ice hockey team.  \n\nb Russian athletes were entitled to participate as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) if individually cleared by the IOC.\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nThe IOC has allowed NBC to influence the Olympic event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible, due to the substantial fees paid by NBC for rights to the Olympics (which have been extended through 2032 with a nearly $8 billion agreement), the company being one of IOC's major sources of revenue.[46][47] As figure skating is one of the most popular Winter Olympic sports among U.S. viewers, the figure skating events were scheduled with morning start times to accommodate primetime broadcasts in the Americas. This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions.[48]\n\n\nConversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.[49]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n*All dates are KST (UTC+9)*\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

Records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n* Noriaki Kasai of Japan became the first athlete in history to participate in eight Winter Olympics when he took part in the ski jumping qualification the day before the opening of the Games.[54] The previous record of seven Winter Olympics was held by Russian luger Albert Demchenko.\n* Japanese athlete Yuzuru Hanyu became the fourth male figure skater (after Gillis Grafström, Karl Schäfer, and Dick Button) to win two consecutive Olympic gold medals.\n* American Nathan Chen became the first figure skater to land five quadruple jumps in one program.[55]\n* German figure skaters Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot set a new ISU best free skating score of 159.31 in pair skating.[56]\n* Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir became the most decorated figure skaters in Olympic history with a total of 5 medals.\n* Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir set a new ISU best short dance score of 83.67[57] and a new ISU best combined total score of 206.07[58] in ice dance. French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron set a new ISU best free dance score of 123.35.[59]\n* Russian figure skater Alina Zagitova set a new ISU best short program score of 82.92 in Ladies' single skating.[60]\n* Dutch speed skater Sven Kramer won gold in the men's 5000 m event, becoming the only male speed skater to win the same Olympic event three times. He was also the first man to win a total of eight Olympic medals in speed skating.[61]\n* Dutch speed skater Ireen Wüst won an individual gold medal for the fourth Olympics in a row, the first time this had been achieved by a Winter Olympian. She also became the first speed skater (male or female) to win ten Winter Olympic medals and the first female Winter Olympian to win nine individual medals.[62]\n* Chinese short track speed skater Wu Dajing beat the men's 500 m world record twice en route to winning a gold medal, becoming only the second person in history to skate the discipline in under 40 seconds (after American J. R. Celski), and the first to achieve this at \"sea level\".[63]\n* Dutch athlete Jorien ter Mors became the first female athlete to win Olympic medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games;[64] she won a speed skating gold medal in the 1000 m and she was also part of the Dutch short track team that won bronze in the 3000 m relay.\n* Ester Ledecká of the Czech Republic won gold in the super-G skiing event and another gold in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom, making her the first female athlete to win Olympic gold medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games.[65]\n* Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen won bronze in the women's team sprint and gold in the 30 km classical event, bringing her total Olympic medal haul to fifteen, the most won by any athlete (male or female) in Winter Olympics history.[66] The record was previously held by fellow Norwegian athlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen who has thirteen Olympic medals.\n* Germany and Canada tied for gold in the two-man bobsleigh event, only the second time in history that two countries had tied for a gold medal in this particular event, the first time being in the 1998 Winter Olympics twenty years earlier.[67]\n* Norway won a total of 39 medals, setting a new record for the highest number of medals won at a single Winter Olympics. Their 39th medal was the last gold medal won by cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen in the 30 km classical event. The record was previously held by the USA who won 37 medals in Vancouver 2010.[68]\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 25 February 2018. IOC president Thomas Bach declared the Games closed, and the cauldron was extinguished. The Olympic flag was handed to Beijing, the next host city of the Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of 2018 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nBroadcast rights to the 2018 Winter Olympics were already sold in some countries as part of long-term broadcast rights deals, including the Games' local rightsholder SBS, which in July 2011 had extended its rights to the Olympics through 2024.[69] SBS sub-licensed its rights to MBC and KBS.[70]\n\n\nOn 29 June 2015, the IOC announced that Discovery Communications (now Discovery, Inc.) had acquired exclusive rights to the Olympics across all of Europe (excluding Russia) from 2018 through 2024. Discovery's pan-European Eurosport channels were promoted as the main broadcaster of the Games, but Discovery's free-to-air channels such as DMAX in Spain,[71] Kanal 5 in Sweden, and TVNorge in Norway, were also involved in the overall broadcasting arrangements.[72] Discovery was required to sub-license at least 100 hours of coverage to free-to-air broadcasters in each market;[73][74] some of these agreements required certain sports to be exclusive to Eurosport and its affiliated networks.[75] The deal did not initially cover France due to the broadcast rights of France Télévisions, which run through to the 2020 Games.[76] In the United Kingdom, Discovery held exclusive pay television rights under licence from the BBC, in return for the BBC sub-licensing the free-to-air rights to the 2022 and 2024 Olympics from Discovery.[77]\n\n\nRussian state broadcaster Channel One, and sports channel Match TV, committed to covering the Games with a focus on Russian athletes.[76] Russia was not affected by the Eurosport deal, due to a pre-existing contract held by a marketing agency which extends to 2024.[76]\n\n\nIn the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under a long-term contract (this would be the only time that the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics will be held on NBC on the same year).[78][79] On 28 March 2017, NBC announced that it would adopt a new format for its primetime coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, with a focus on live coverage in all time zones to take advantage of Pyeongchang's 14-hour difference with U.S. Eastern Time (and 17-hour difference with U.S. Pacific Time), and to address criticism of its previous tape delay practices. As before, the primetime block began at 8:00 p.m. ET (5:00 p.m. PT), and unlike previous Olympics, was available for streaming. Figure skating events were deliberately scheduled with morning sessions so they could be aired during primetime in the Americas (and in turn, NBC's coverage; due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible; NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on 7 May 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[46] is also one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC).[47][48] Coverage took a break in the East for late local news, after which coverage continued into \"Primetime Plus\", featuring additional live coverage into the Eastern late night and Western primetime hours.\n\n\nNHK and Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) once again filmed portions of the Games in high-dynamic-range 8K resolution video, including 90 hours of footage of selected events and the opening ceremonies.[80][81] ATSC 3.0 digital terrestrial television, using 4K resolution, was introduced in South Korea in 2017 in time for the Olympics.[82][83] This footage was delivered in 4K in the U.S. by NBCUniversal parent Comcast to participating television providers, including its own Xfinity, as well as DirecTV and Dish Network. NBC's Raleigh-based affiliate WRAL-TV also held demonstration viewings as part of its ATSC 3.0 test broadcasts.[84][85][86]\n\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics were used to showcase 5G wireless technologies, as part of a collaboration between domestic wireless sponsor KT, and worldwide sponsor Intel. Several venues were outfitted with 5G networks to facilitate features such as live camera feeds from bobsleds, and multi-camera views from cross-country and figure skating events. These were offered as part of public demonstrations coordinated by the two sponsors.[87][88]\n\n\nThe winners of the Olympic Golden Rings Awards were announced in June 2019. There were 75 pieces of broadcast content from the 2018 Olympics submitted over ten categories (plus one category for the 2018 Youth Olympics). NBC won a total of eight awards, winning four of the main categories: Best Olympic Feature, Best Olympic Digital Service, Best Olympic program and Best Documentary Film; they came second in the Best On-Air Promotion and Best Social Media Content/Production categories. Discovery/Eurosport won four categories: Best On-Air Promotion, Best Production Design, Best Innovation and Best Social Media Content/Production; they also came second in the Best Olympic Digital Service category. The BBC and NHK took the other two main awards: Most Sustainable Operation and Best Athlete Profile respectively. The title of Best Feature at the Youth Olympic Games Buenos Aires 2018 was also awarded to the BBC.[89]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics marketing\n\nThe official emblem, reflecting ice crystals and derived from the hangul letters ㅍ and ㅊ—the initial sounds of \"Pyeong\" and \"Chang\"—was unveiled on 3 May 2013.[90] In all official materials, the name of the host city was stylized in CamelCase as \"PyeongChang\", in order to alleviate potential confusion with Pyongyang, the similarly named capital of neighboring North Korea.[91]\n\n\nNew international sponsorship deals also debuted in Pyeongchang: Toyota was introduced as the new \"Mobility\" sponsor of the Olympics, although the company waived its domestic sponsorship to the local competitors Hyundai and Kia due to their support of the Pyeongchang bid.[92][93][94][95][96] Alibaba Group and Intel also debuted as e-commerce/cloud services and technology sponsors respectively.[97][98]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n### North–South Korean relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: North Korea–South Korea relations, 2017–18 North Korea crisis, and North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nDue to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests. On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games.[99] The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic, the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Protesters at Gwanghwamun Plaza, criticizing the event's pro-North Korean measures\nThe next day, Austria and Germany raised similar concerns and also threatened to skip the Games. France later reaffirmed its participation.[101] In early December 2017, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told Fox News that it was an \"open question\" whether the United States was going to participate in the Games, citing security concerns in the region.[102] However, days later the White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, stated that the United States would participate.[103]\n\n\nIn his New Year's address on 1 January 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un proposed talks in Seoul over the country's participation in the Games, which would be the first high-level talks between the North and South in over two years. Because of the talks, held on 9 January, North Korea agreed to field athletes in Pyeongchang.[104][105] On 17 January 2018, it was announced that North and South Korea had agreed to field a unified Korean women's ice hockey team at the Games, and to enter together under a Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][106]\n\n\nThese moves were met with opposition in South Korea, including protests and online petitions; critics argued that the government was attempting to use the Olympics to spread pro-North Korean sentiment, and that the unified ice hockey team would fail.[107] A rap video entitled \"The Regret for Pyeongchang\" (평창유감), which echoed this criticism and called the event the \"Pyongyang Olympics\", went viral in the country.[108] Japan's foreign affairs minister Tarō Kōno warned South Korea to be wary of North Korea's \"charm offensive\", and not to ease its pressure on the country.[36][109]\n\n\nThe South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, at the start of the Olympics shook hands with Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and a prominent figure of the regime. This marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea.[110][111] In contrast, U.S. vice president Mike Pence met with Fred Warmbier (father of Otto Warmbier, who had died after being released from captivity in North Korea) and a group of North Korean defectors in Pyeongchang.[112] American officials said that North Korea cancelled a meeting with Pence at the last minute.[113]\n\n\nAt the closing ceremony, North Korea sent general Kim Yong-chol as its delegate. His presence was met with hostility from South Korean conservatives, as there were allegations that he had a role in the ROKS *Cheonan* sinking and other past attacks. The Ministry of Unification stated that \"there is a limitation in pinpointing who was responsible for the incident.\" Although he is subject to sanctions, they did not affect his ability to visit the country for the Games.[114][115]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, Oswald Commission, Russian doping scandal after the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russian doping scandal at the 2016 Summer Olympics, and Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nRussia's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics was affected by the aftermath of its state-sponsored doping program. As a result, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in December 2017, although Russian athletes whitelisted by the IOC were allowed to compete neutrally under the OAR (Olympic Athletes from Russia) designation.[116] The official sanctions imposed by the IOC included: the exclusion of Russian government officials from the Games; the use of the Olympic flag and Olympic Anthem in place of the Russian flag and anthem; and the submission of a replacement logo for the OAR uniforms.[117]\n\n\nBy early January 2018, the IOC had banned 43 Russian athletes from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics and all future Olympic Games (as part of the Oswald Commission). Of those athletes, 42 appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and 28 of the appeals were successful, but eleven of the athletes had their sanctions upheld due to the weight of evidence against them. The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. Hearings for the remaining three athletes were postponed.[118]\n\n\nThe eventual number of neutral Russian athletes that participated at the 2018 Games was 168. These were selected from an original pool of 500 athletes that was put forward for consideration and, in order to receive an invitation to the Games, they were obliged to meet a number of pre-games conditions. Two athletes, who met the conditions and were cleared by the IOC, subsequently failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin and other officials had signalled in the past that it would be a humiliation if Russian athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag.[119] However, there were never actually any official plans to boycott the 2018 Games[116] and in late 2017 the Russian government agreed to allow their athletes to compete at the Games as individuals under a neutral designation.[120][121] Despite this public show of co-operation, there were numerous misgivings voiced by leading Russian politicians, including a statement from Putin himself saying that he believed the United States had used its influence within the IOC to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\".[122] 86% of the Russian population opposed participation at the Olympics under a neutral flag,[123] and many Russian fans attended the Games wearing the Russian colors and chanting \"Russia!\" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.[124]\n\n\nThe IOC's decision was heavily criticized by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), in whose opinion the judgement was commercially and politically motivated. He argued that not only was doping rife among Russian athletes but that there was no sign of it being eradicated.[125] The CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was also fiercely criticized, by Olympic officials, IOC president Thomas Bach and whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov's lawyer.[126]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2018 Winter Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in South Korea\n\t+ 1988 Summer Olympics – Seoul\n\t+ 2018 Winter Olympics – Pyeongchang\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* Soohorang and Bandabi\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Including United Korean (COR) women's ice hockey team.\n2. **^** \"French and English are the official languages for the Olympic Games.\", [1].(..)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Who won Team Canada's 29 medals in PyeongChang?\". *olympic.ca*. 25 February 2018.

Rio de Janeiro was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009.\n\n\n11,238 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team.[2][3] With 306 sets of medals, the Games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America,[4] as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America (the second being 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina), and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5] These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.[3]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (121); the US team also won its 1,000th Summer Olympic gold medal overall. Great Britain finished second and became the first country to increase its tally of medals in the Olympiad immediately after being host nation in 2012.[6] China finished third in the medal table. Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\n![](image)A young girl adding her signature in support of Rio de Janeiro's candidacy.\n![Several people dressed in formal attire sit behind a bench. There are repeated graphics behind them.](image)The bid committee, led by Carlos Arthur Nuzman, giving a press conference.\nThe bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16 May 2007.[7] The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13 September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. Others included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time.[8]\n\n\nNawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense. It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign.\n> \n> — Jon Tibbs, a consultant on the Tokyo bid[10]\n> \n\n\nThe final voting was held in Copenhagen on 2 October 2009, with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favorites to secure the Games. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Summer Olympics bidding results[11]\n| **City** | **NOC** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** |\n|  **Rio de Janeiro** |  **![](image) Brazil** | 26\n | **46** | **66** |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | **28** | 29\n | 32\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | 22\n | 20\n | —\n |\n| Chicago | ![](image) United States | 18\n | —\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on AroundTheRings.com that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This came just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons.[12] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO.[13]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters–Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã–as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.[17]\n\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history. Fittings included about 80,000 chairs, 70,000 tables, 29,000 mattresses, 60,000 clothes hangers, 6,000 television sets and 10,000 smartphones.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Barra Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Barra Olympic Park\nThe Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca, in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The site was formerly occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepaguá Formula One circuit.[19]\n\n\nThe nine venues within the Olympic Park were:[20][21]\n\n\n\n* Carioca Arena 1 – basketball (capacity: 16,000)\n* Carioca Arena 2 – wrestling, judo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Carioca Arena 3 – fencing, taekwondo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Future Arena – handball (capacity: 12,000)\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre – diving, synchronized swimming, water polo (capacity: 5,000)\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium – swimming, water polo play-offs (capacity: 15,000)\n* Olympic Tennis Centre – tennis (capacity: 10,000 Main Court)\n* Rio Olympic Arena – gymnastics (capacity: 12,000)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome – track cycling (capacity: 5,000)\n\n\n#### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nAs well as the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and Maracanã and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília and Manaus.\n\n\n\n* ![Maracanã Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nMaracanã Stadium  \nRio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Olympic Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nOlympic Stadium   \n Rio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Arena da Amazônia Manaus, AM](image)\n\nArena da Amazônia  \nManaus, AM\n* ![Arena Corinthians São Paulo, SP](image)\n\nArena Corinthians  \nSão Paulo, SP\n* ![Arena Fonte Nova Salvador, BA](image)\n\nArena Fonte Nova  \nSalvador, BA\n* ![Estádio Nacional Brasília, DF](image)\n\nEstádio Nacional  \nBrasília, DF\n* ![Mineirão Belo Horizonte, MG](image)\n\nMineirão  \nBelo Horizonte, MG\n\n\n### Urban renovation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Rio de Janeiro\n\n![](image)Mauá Square, with the Museum of Tomorrow, designed by Santiago Calatrava, and the light rail.\nRio's historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as *Porto Maravilha*, covering 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi) in area. The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increase the city center's attractiveness, and enhance Rio's competitive position in the global economy.[22]\n\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700 km (430 mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4 km (2.5 mi) of tunnels; 70 km (43 mi) of roads; 650 km2 (250 sq mi) of sidewalks; 17 km (11 mi) of bike path; 15,000 trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.[24][25]\n\n\nIn May 2017, an Associated Press article disclosed that over 100 athletes who had won medals at the Rio Olympics reported that their medals were showing some damage, including black spots, flaking, or surface degrading. Rio officials offered to replace any defective medals and found problems with 6 to 7 percent of all those awarded.[26]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)Basketball player Anderson Varejão carrying the torch in São Paulo\n![](image)Volunteers working at the Olympic Stadium during the Games\nThe Olympic flame was lit on 21 April 2016 at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay. The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on 27 April. A brief stop-off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva.[27]\n\n\nThe torch relay began its journey around Brazil on 3 May at the capital Brasília. The flame visited more than 300 Brazilian cities, including all 26 state capitals and the Brazilian Federal District.[28] The relay ended in Rio de Janeiro on 5 August when the flame was used to light the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony.\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012. More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014. The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site.[29] Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals.[30]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in Brazilian reais (BRL). A total of 7.5 million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. About 3.8 million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Future Arena, a temporary venue designed for future reconstruction into school buildings\nAs an aspect of its bid, Rio's organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the 2016 Games, going on to dub them a \"Green Games for a Blue Planet\".[33] As legacy projects, organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio's sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay,[33][34] and plant 24 million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games. However, some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls, leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them.[33][35]\n\n\nThe focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols. To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\nThe Future Arena, the venue for the handball competitions, was designed as a temporary modular structure whose components could be reconstructed after the Games to build schools.[38] However, as of November 2017, the arena was still standing due to lack of funds to dismantle it and no allocation of funds to do so in the 2018 budget.[39] Portions of the opening ceremony were dedicated to the issue of climate change.[40]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)A scene from the opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracana Stadium on 5 August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington.[41] The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming.[40][42] The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion.[4]\n\n\nThe ceremony included the inaugural presentation of the Olympic Laurel, an honor bestowed by the IOC on those that have made \"significant achievements in education, culture, development and peace through sport\"; the trophy was awarded to Kenyan athlete Kipchoge Keino.[43] The Games were officially opened by the acting president of Brazil, Michel Temer.[44]\n\n\nThe Olympic cauldron was lit by long-distance runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima,[4] the men's marathon bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympics, who had also received the IOC's Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship after being attacked by a spectator and losing his lead in the race.[41][45] The cauldron was originally expected to be lit by Brazilian footballer Pelé, but he declined to participate due to health problems.[42][46][47]\n\n\nFollowing the opening ceremony, a public cauldron was lit in front of the Candelária Church by Jorge Gomes, a 14-year-old Brazilian athlete who had escaped from poverty to train as a runner.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Youth Arena\n![](image)Deodoro Stadium\n![](image)Olympic BMX Centre\n![](image)Olympic Golf Course\nThe 2016 Summer Olympic program featured 28 sports encompassing 306 events.

Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.[50]\n\n\nIn August, the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens—a seven-player version of rugby union—by a majority vote; baseball/softball, roller sports, and squash were removed from contention, leaving golf, karate, and rugby sevens in the running. A final vote was held on 9 October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.[51][52]\n\n\nThe 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme.[53] The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against,[54] and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26.[55] Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.\n\n\nIn May 2012, the International Sailing Federation announced that windsurfing would be replaced by kitesurfing at the 2016 Olympics,[56] but this decision was reversed in November.[57]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rio 2016 Olympic Village\nAll 205 National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete.[*citation needed*] The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games.[58]\n\n\nAs host nation, Brazil received automatic entry for some sports including in all cycling disciplines and six places for weightlifting events.[59][60]\n\n\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics were the first Games in which Kosovo and South Sudan were eligible to participate. Bulgarian and Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti-doping violations.[61][62]\n\n\nKuwait was banned in October 2015 for the second time in five years over government interference in the country's Olympic committee.[63]\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Country by team size\n![](image)Participating countries color code  \nBlue = Participated for the first time in 2016.  \n Green

crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag. During the previous Summer Olympic Games, refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs.[64] On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Independent athletes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nDue to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\nIn November 2015, Russia was provisionally suspended from all international track and field athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) following a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report into a doping program in the country.[66] The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for \"exceptional eligibility\" to participate in the Games as \"neutral\" athletes if it was independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program.[67]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2016, the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA's recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally, stating that the Olympic Charter \"does not foresee such 'neutral athletes'\" and that it was each country's National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing.[68] As a result, Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag, although they would compete under a neutral flag in the 2018 Winter Olympics following several developments concerning the doping investigation.\n\n\n\n#### National houses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Nation | Location | Name\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa House |

the 2016 Summer Olympics. The records were set in archery, athletics, canoeing, cycling track, modern pentathlon, rowing, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting.\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The public cauldron, located outside the Candelária Church\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016),[71][72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET, 9:00 p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country.[73][74][75][76]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\n![](image)2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony at Maracanã Stadium\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracanã Stadium.[77] As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games' organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.[78]\n\n\nThe creative director for the ceremony was Rosa Magalhães.[79] Amid heavy rainfall, the ceremony began with interpretive dancers representing various landmarks in the host city. Martinho da Vila then performed a rendition of \"Carinhoso [pt]\" by Pixinguinha. In another segment, introducing the athletes, singer Roberta Sá channeled Carmen Miranda, the fruit-headdress-wearing, mid-century Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved camp figure. The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of 27 children, representing the states of Brazil, sang the Brazilian national anthem.\n\n\n\n### Cost[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.[80]\n\n\nIndirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics' cost of US$4.6 billion compares with costs of US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.[80]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBarra Olympic Park\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below.

Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster.[81] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats.[82] In the United States, NBC offered 4K content downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support, to participating television providers.[83] Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics to Grupo Globo. Replacing Record, the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo, pay TV, and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with Rede Bandeirantes. IOC board member Richard Carrión described the agreement as \"unprecedented\", touting that \"by working with Brazil's leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games.\"[84]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic rings displayed in Rio de Janeiro\nIn November 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis. The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo's show *Esporte Espetacular* finished third, and CCTV from China feature *A Sequel of Love* came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature *The Most Beautiful Thing*. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam. TV Globo went one better than the previous category coming second with their profile of Isaquias Queiroz. The winner of the category again was NBC, this time for their piece on Wayde van Niekerk. The Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places. The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV/Globosat, while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium.[85]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vinicius and Tom\n\n![](image)Vinicius (left), the mascot of the Rio 2016, and Tom (right), the mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics\nOn 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by Sao Paulo-based animation company Birdo.[86] The Olympic mascot Vinicius, named after musician Vinicius de Moraes, represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats, monkeys, and birds.[86] According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\".[87]\n\n\nBrand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots were intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil's culture and people.[88] The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote whose results were announced on 14 December 2014. The names, which reference the co-writers of the song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", won over two other sets of names, tallying 44 percent of 323,327 votes.[89] At the Olympic wrestling events, coaches were given plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee's call.[90]\n\n\n\n### Emblem[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sculpture of the *Rio 2016* logo in Barra Olympic Park\nThe official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tatíl Design and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies.[91] The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet, with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain. It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics.[92]\n\n\nThe logo has been noted as evoking Henri Matisse's painting *Dance*. There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own; while also consisting of several figures linked in motion, the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures. This was not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event; in 2004, the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of Carnival celebrations in Salvador. Gelli defended the allegations, stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original, as it was \"an ancient reference\" and \"in the collective unconscious\". Gelli cited *Dance* as an influence of the logo's concept and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible.[93]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThe lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies, including: Brazil's political and economic crisis; the Zika virus epidemic; the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia, which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games. However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics,[94] and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n### Political and economic crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Brazilian economic crisis, Operation Car Wash, and Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff\n\n![](image)Suspended president Dilma Rousseff during an interview with Al Jazeera at the Alvorada Palace on 1 June 2016\nIn 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters,[98] both anti- and pro-Rousseff.[99][100] At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop. On 12 May 2016, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games.[101]\n\n\nOn 5 October 2017, Brazilian Olympic Committee head Carlos Nuzman was arrested amid a money-laundering investigation into a $2 million payment that was allegedly made to secure votes for the bid to bring the Olympics to Rio. The money was believed to have been paid to former IAAF president Lamine Diack and his son Papa Massata Diack, who was a member of the IOC at the time of the alleged payment, which was three days before the vote in 2009. All three were charged with money laundering, along with the former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral (who was already in prison for money laundering offenses at the time), Brazilian businessman Arthur Soares, and ex-Brazilian Olympic Committee chief Leonardo Gryner. All six were charged with running a criminal organization, money laundering, and violating currency laws in their own native countries.[102] On 4 July 2019, it was reported that Cabral told a judge that the money paid to Diack was used to buy as many as nine votes.[103] Rio mayor Eduardo Paes was also accused of corruption and fraud in relation to the construction of a number of venues for the Games.[104][105]\n\n\n\n### Zika virus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic\n\n![](image)Agent for endemic diseases of the city of Votuporanga, São Paulo\nAn outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues.[106] Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games.[107]\n\n\nIn May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization (WHO), calling upon them to, according to co-author Arthur Caplan, have \"an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil\". The WHO dismissed the request, stating that \"cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics [would] not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus\", and that there was \"no public health justification\" for postponing them.[108][109][110]\n\n\nSome athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic.[111][112] On 2 September 2016, however, the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the 2016 Olympics.[113]\n\n\n\n### Environmental problems[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Brazil and Water supply and sanitation in Brazil\n\n![](image)Fort Copacabana hosted the cycling road race (start and finish), marathon swimming and triathlon events.\nThe Guanabara Bay, whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue. At the Earth Summit in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay.[114][115] However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues.[34] Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated;[116] this raw sewage also leaked into the bay. Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated,[117] at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics.[118]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Crime in Brazil and Terrorism in Brazil\n\n![](image)F-5EM Tiger II fighter jet of the Brazilian Air Force during an air intercept training for Rio 2016\nRio's crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the 2016 Games; mayor Paes stated that the city was facing \"big issues\" in heightening security, but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process.[119]\n\n\nThe governor of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems, with a terrorist attack occurring just a day after it was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics. The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.[120]\n\n\nOn 21 July 2016, two weeks before the scheduled start of the Games, the Brazilian Federal Police broke up an Islamic jihadist terrorist ring by arresting 12 people.[121]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Doping in Russia and McLaren Report\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the Russian Olympic Committee in Moscow\nIn December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report, and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work, and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.[122] After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren, which found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\".[123]\n\n\nIn response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[124] The IOC rejected the recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport's international federation would make decisions on each athlete's individual basis.[125][126] A day before the opening ceremony, 278 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 111 were removed because of doping.[127] In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag for a non-doping related matter.[128][129] Unlike the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee after it found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.[130]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2016 Summer Paralympics\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The official logo of the 2016 Summer Olympics was made in 3D design, made by Brazilian design company Tàtil Design; it was inspired by Brazil's rich history of festivals and its colorful people; it also symbolizes energy, passion and unity.

Opening rounds in certain events were held on 6 February 2014, the day before the opening ceremony.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach. Both the Olympics and Paralympics were organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It was the first Olympics to be held in a CIS state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was previously the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\n\nA record ninety-eight events in fifteen winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions—a total of twelve accounting for gender—were held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, women's ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochi's Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium, and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance; and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics were the most expensive Games in the history of the Olympics. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, major cost overruns caused this figure to expand to US$51 billion, more than three times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics and even surpassing the estimated cost of US$44 billion for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1 billion people worldwide.[1]\n\n\nIn 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late-2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up.[2][3][4] The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Fans celebrating Sochi's bid win\nSochi was elected on 4 July 2007 during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, defeating bids from Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea.[7] This is the first time that the Russian Federation has hosted the Winter Olympics. The Soviet Union was the host of the 1980 Summer Olympics held in and around Moscow.\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 host city election – ballot results[8]\n| City\n | Country (NOC)\n | Round 1\n | Round 2\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sochi | ![](image) Russia | 34 | **51** |\n| Pyeongchang | ![](image) South Korea | **36** | 47\n |\n| Salzburg | ![](image) Austria | 25 | —\n |\n\n\n## Cost and financing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cost of the Olympic Games\n\nAs of October 2013, the estimated combined cost of the 2014 Winter Olympics had topped US$51 billion.[9] This amount included the cost for Olympic games themselves and cost of Sochi infrastructural projects (roads, railroads, power plants). This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing,[10] which hosted 3 times as many events.[11] Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.[12][13][14]\n\n\nIn its final budget published in June 2014, Olimpstroy—the state corporation that oversaw the Sochi Olympics development—reported the total allocated funds for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics of 1,524 billion rubles (US$49.5 billion).[15] However, only about a fifth of that budget ($10.8 billion) was directly related to the Olympic games, while the rest went into urban and regional regeneration and the conversion of the Sochi region into an all-year round sea and alpine resort.[15] The breakdown table below is based on a report that has analyzed the distribution of Olimpstroy's $49.5 billion budget. Estimates also suggest that additional unrecoverable operational costs (including for security) could have added another $3 billion.[15]\n\n\n\n### The breakdown of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics costs[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCosts breakdown[15]\n| Item\n | Cost\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| million RUB\n | million US$\n |\n| **Direct Olympics costs (a)+(b)+(c)** | **331,098** | **10,753** |\n| **(a) Olympic venues** | **221,592** | **7,197** |\n| ***Coastal Cluster*** | ***96,366*** | ***3,130*** |\n| Fisht Olympic Stadium\n | 18,994\n | 617\n |\n| Bolshoy Ice Dome\n | 10,102\n | 328\n |\n| Shayba Arena\n | 3,484\n | 113\n |\n| Adler Arena Skating Centre\n | 7,406\n | 241\n |\n| Iceberg Skating Palace\n | 8,127\n | 264\n |\n| Ice Cube Curling Centre\n | 735\n | 24\n |\n| Main Media Centre\n | 17,426\n | 566\n |\n| The Olympic Park\n | 9,871\n | 321\n |\n| Olympic Village (3000 places)\n | 12,217\n | 397\n |\n| A complex for Olympic partners (1285 apartments)\n | 8,003\n | 260\n |\n| ***Mountain Cluster*** | ***125,226*** | ***4,067*** |\n| Rosa Khutor Extreme Park (freestyle skiing, snowboarding)\n | 3,393\n | 110\n |\n| Rosa Khutor Alpine Skiing Centre\n | 11,911\n | 387\n |\n| Sanki Sliding Centre (bobsleigh, luge, skeleton)\n | 7,487\n | 243\n |\n| RusSki Gorki Jumping Centre (ski jumps, Nordic combined)\n | 9,889\n | 321\n |\n| Laura Centre (biathlon and cross-country) and Olympic Village (1100 places)\n | 74,525\n | 2,420\n |\n| Main Alpine Olympic Village (2600 places) at Rosa Khutor\n | 18,021\n | 585\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(b) Site preparation and supporting infrastructure** | **85,370** | **2,773** |\n| Key infrastructure for Olympic venues (roads, energy, water, waste, security), planning and other works\n | 81,413\n | 2,644\n |\n| SOCOG office building\n | 3,957\n | 129\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(c) Operational costs (part of)** | **24,135** | **784** |\n| Opening/closing ceremonies (equipment and organisation)\n | 3,444\n | 112\n |\n| Broadcasting and photo equipment\n | 13,330\n | 433\n |\n| Vehicles for visitors and logistics\n | 6,958\n | 226\n |\n| Live Sites city programme\n | 403\n | 13\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **INDIRECT COSTS (d)+(e)** | **1,193,348** | **38,758** |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(d) Skiing and tourist resorts** | **189,937** | **6,169** |\n| Gazprom Alpine Tourist Centre\n | 60,723\n | 1,972\n |\n| Rosa Khutor\n | 35,078\n | 1,139\n |\n| Gornaya Karusel/Gorky Gorod\n | 72,728\n | 2,362\n |\n| Alpika Service\n | 21,408\n | 695\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(e) Other projects** | **1,003,411** | **32,589** |\n| Hotels and health resorts\n | 130,755\n | 4,247\n |\n| Formula One racing\n | 11,982\n | 389\n |\n| Olympic University\n | 12,946\n | 420\n |\n| Combined road and railroad linking the two clusters\n | 317,224\n | 10,303\n |\n| Railways and rail terminals\n | 38,015\n | 1,235\n |\n| Road infrastructure\n | 189,532\n | 6,156\n |\n| Sochi Airport\n | 22,895\n | 744\n |\n| Sochi Seaport\n | 27,673\n | 899\n |\n| Housing projects\n | 11,379\n | 370\n |\n| Power generation and grids\n | 74,305\n | 2,413\n |\n| Gasification projects\n | 46,048\n | 1,496\n |\n| Other engineering, water, waste, telecommunications and other infrastructure\n | 104,912\n | 3,407\n |\n| Nature and culture parks\n | 11,346\n | 369\n |\n| Two hospitals\n | 4,399\n | 143\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **Total (a)+(b)+(c)+(d)+(e)** | **1,524,445** | **49,511** |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)\nSochi\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Sochi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in Europe.\n\n![](image)Sochi from space, showing locations of Olympic park and ski venues\nWith an average February temperature of 8.3 °C (46.9 °F) and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games.[16] Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games.[17] It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sochi Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the Sochi Olympic Park\n![](image)Panoramic view of the Sochi Olympic Park\nThe Sochi Olympic Park was built by the Black Sea coast in the Imeretinsky Valley, about 4 km (2.5 miles) from Russia's border with Abkhazia/Georgia.[18][19] The venues were clustered around a central water basin on which the Medals Plaza is built, allowing all indoor venues to be within walking distance. It also features \"The Waters of the Olympic Park\" (designed by California-based company WET), a choreographed fountain which served as the backdrop in the medals awards and the opening and closing ceremonies of the event.[20][21] The new venues include:[22]\n\n\n\n* Fisht Olympic Stadium – ceremonies (opening/closing) 40,000 spectators\n* Bolshoy Ice Dome – ice hockey (final), 12,000 spectators\n* Shayba Arena – ice hockey, 7,000 spectators\n* Adler Arena Skating Center – speed skating, 8,000 spectators\n* Iceberg Skating Palace – figure skating, short track speed skating, 12,000 spectators\n* Ice Cube Curling Center – curling, 3,000 spectators\n* Main Olympic village\n* International broadcasting centre and main press room\n\n\n![](image)\nA sketch of the layout of Sochi Olympic Park.\n\n### Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai\n\n![](image)Chairlift in Krasnaya Polyana\n* Laura Biathlon & Ski Complex – biathlon, cross-country skiing\n* Rosa Khutor Extreme Park – freestyle skiing and snowboarding\n* Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort – alpine skiing\n* Sliding Center Sanki – bobsleigh, luge and skeleton\n* RusSki Gorki Jumping Center – ski jumping and Nordic combined (both ski jumping and cross-country skiing on a 2 km route around the arena)\n* Roza Khutor plateau Olympic Village\n\n\n![](image)\n2014 Winter Olympics Mountain Cluster Venues (interactive map)\n\n### Post-Olympic usage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fisht Olympic Stadium under re-construction in 2015.\nA street circuit known as the Sochi Autodrom was constructed in and around Olympic Park. Its primary use is to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix, which held its inaugural edition in October 2014.[23][24]\n\n\nIn January 2015, work began on adapting Fisht Olympic Stadium into an open-air football stadium to host matches during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[25][26]\n\n\nA new ice hockey team in the Kontinental Hockey League, HC Sochi Leopards, now plays in Bolshoy Arena.\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics marketing\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vladimir Putin with George W. Bush and Laura Bush examining the models of the Olympic facilities for Sochi, April 2008\n![](image)100 Russian ruble banknote issued in 2013 by the Central Bank of Russia\nThe Olympic infrastructure was constructed according to a Federal Target Program (FTP). In June 2009, the Games' organizers reported they were one year ahead in building the main Olympic facilities as compared to recent Olympic Games.[27] In November 2011, IOC President Jacques Rogge was in Sochi and concluded that the city had made significant progress since he last visited eighteen months earlier.[28]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications in Russia\n\nAccording to the FTP, US$580 million would be spent on construction and modernization of telecommunications in the region. Avaya was named by the Sochi Organizing Committee as the official supplier of telecommunications equipment. Avaya provided the data network equipment, including switches, routers, security, telephones and contact-center systems. It provided engineers and technicians to design and test the systems, and worked with other technology partners to provide athletes, dignitaries and fans information about the Games.[29][30]\n\n\nThe 2014 Olympics is the first \"fabric-enabled\" Games using Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology.[31] The network is capable of handling up to 54 Tbit/s of traffic.[32]\n\n\nInfrastructure built for the games included:\n\n\n\n* A network of TETRA mobile radio communications for 100 user groups (with capacity of 10,000 subscribers);\n* 712 km (442 mi) of fiber-optic cables along the Anapa-Dzhubga-Sochi highways and Dzhubga–Krasnodar branch;\n* Digital broadcasting infrastructure, including radio and television broadcasting stations (building and communications towers) with coverage from Grushevaya Polyana (*Pear Glade*) to Sochi and Anapa cities. The project also included construction of infocommunications centre for broadcasting abroad via three HDTV satellites.\n\n\nDuring the Games, the core networks of Rostelecom and Transtelekom were used.[33]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the newest equipment for the television coverage of the Games arrived in the port of Adler. Prepared specifically for the Games, a team of regional specialists and the latest technology provide a qualitatively new level of television production in the region.[34]\n\n\nThe fiber-optic channel links Sochi between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana. The 46-kilometre-long (29 mi) channel enables videoconferencing and news reporting from the Olympics.[35]\n\n\nIn November 2013, it was reported that the fiber-optic cable that was built by the Federal Communications Agency, Rossvyaz, had no operator. With Rostelecom and Megafon both refusing to operate it, the line was transferred to the ownership of the state enterprise Center for Monitoring & Development of Infocommunication Technologies (Russian: Центр МИР ИТ).[36]\n\n\nRussian mobile phone operator Megafon expanded and improved Sochi's telecom infrastructure with over 700 new 2G/3G/4G cell towers. Sochi was the first Games to offer 4G connectivity at a speed of 10 MB/sec.\n\n\nIn January 2014, Rostelecom reported that it had connected the Olympic media center in Sochi to the Internet and organized channels of communication with the main media center of the Olympic Games in the coastal cluster and press center in Moscow. The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Power infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Night view of Sochi during the Olympics, taken by Expedition 38 members from the International Space Station\nA five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the Russian Ministry of Regional Development, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.[39]\n\n\nAccording to the strategy, the capacity of the regional energy network would increase by two and a half times by 2014, guaranteeing a stable power supply during and after the Games.\n\n\nThe power demand of Sochi at the end of May 2009 was 424 MW. The power demand of the Olympic infrastructure was expected to be about 340 MW.\n\n\n\n* Poselkovaya electrical substation became operational in early 2009.\n* Sochi thermal power station reconstructed (expected power output was 160 MW)\n* Laura and Rosa Khutor electrical substations were completed in November 2010\n* Mzymta electrical substation was completed in March 2011\n* Krasnopolyanskaya hydroelectric power station was completed in 2010\n* Adler CHP station design and construction was completed in 2012. Expected power output was 360 MW[40]\n* Bytkha substation, under construction[*when?*] with two transformers 25 MW each, includes dependable microprocessor-based protection\n\n\nEarlier plans also include building combined cycle (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of Tuapse and Novorossiysk and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the Black Sea.[41]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in Russia\n\nThe transport infrastructure prepared to support the Olympics includes many roads, tunnels, bridges, interchanges, railroads and stations in and around Sochi. Among others, 8 flyovers, 102 bridges, tens of tunnels and a bypass route for heavy trucks – 367 km (228 mi) of roads were paved.[42]\n\n\nThe Sochi Light Metro is located between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana connecting the Olympic Park, Sochi International Airport, and the venues in Krasnaya Polyana.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Park railway station\nThe existing 102 km (63-mile), Tuapse-to-Adler railroad was renovated to provide double track throughout, increasing capacity and enabling a reliable regional service to be provided and extending to the airport. In December 2009, Russian Railways ordered 38 Siemens Mobility Desiro trains for delivery in 2013 for use during the Olympics, with an option for a further 16 partly built in Russia.[44]\n\n\nAt Sochi International Airport, a new terminal was built along a 3.5 km (2.2-mile) runway extension, overlapping the Mzymta River.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sochi seaport\nAt the Port of Sochi, a new offshore terminal 1.5 km (0.93 mi) from the shore allows docking for cruise ships with capacities of 3,000 passengers.[46] The cargo terminal of the seaport would be moved from the centre of Sochi.\n\n\nRoadways were detoured, some going around the construction site and others being cut off.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)A \"Lastochka\" (Siemens Desiro) train, which serves the Tuapse–Sochi route\nIn May 2009, Russian Railways started the construction of tunnel complex No. 1 (the final total is six) on the combined road (automobile and railway) from Adler to Alpica Service Mountain Resort in the Krasnaya Polyana region. The tunnel complex No. 1 is located near Akhshtyr in Adlersky City District, and includes:[48]\n\n\n\n* Escape tunnel, 2.25 kilometres (1.40 mi), completed in 2010\n* Road tunnel, 2,153 metres (7,064 ft), completed in 2013\n* One-track railway tunnel, 2,473 metres (8,114 ft), completed in 2013\n\n\nRussian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin stated the road construction costed more than 200 billion rubles.[49]\n\n\nIn addition, Sochi's railway stations were renovated. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta, Khosta, Lazarevskaya, and Loo railway stations. In Adler, a new railway station was built while the original building was preserved, and in the Olympic park cluster, a new station was built from scratch, the Olympic Park railway station. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\n\n### Other infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sochi at night from space[50]\nFunds were spent on the construction of hotels for 10,300 guests.[51] The first of the Olympic hotels, Zvezdny (*Stellar*), was rebuilt anew.[52] Significant funds were spent on the construction of an advanced sewage treatment system in Sochi, designed by Olimpstroy. The system meets BREF standards and employs top available technologies for environment protection, including tertiary treatment with microfiltration.[53]\n\n\nSix post offices were opened at competition venues, two of them in the main media centre in Olympic Park and in the mountain village of Estosadok. In addition to standard services, customers had access to unique services including two new products, Fotomarka and Retropismo. Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylized sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one's own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and wax seal affixing. All the new sites and post offices in Sochi were opened during the Olympics until late night 7 days a week, and employees were trained to speak English.[54]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics torch relay\nTorch relay in Moscow\nOn 29 September 2013, the Olympic torch was lit in Ancient Olympia, beginning a seven-day journey across Greece and on to Russia, then the torch relay started at Moscow on 7 October 2013 before passing 83 Russian cities and arriving at Sochi on the day of the opening ceremony, 7 February 2014.[55] It is the longest torch relay in Olympic history, a 60,000-kilometre (40,000 mi) route that passes through all regions of the country, from Kaliningrad in the west to Chukotka in the east.\n\n\nThe Olympic torch reached the North Pole for first time via a nuclear-powered icebreaker *(50 Let Pobedy)*. The torch was also passed for the first time in space, though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed livery including the Games' emblem. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky waved the torch on a spacewalk outside the ISS. The torch returned to Earth five days later on board Soyuz TMA-09M.[56][57] The torch also reached Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and Siberia's Lake Baikal.[58]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony and 2014 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks over Fisht Olympic Stadium following the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron.\n![](image)The Olympic Rings at Sochi Olympic Park\nThe opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium, an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak, who exited the stadium to jointly light the Olympic cauldron located near the center of Olympic Park.[59][60][61][62]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record 88 nations qualified to compete,[63] which beat the previous record of 82 set at the previous Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Seven nations made their Winter Olympics debut: Dominica, Malta, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe.[64] The Winter debut of Malta meant that for the first time ever, all of the current members of the European Olympic Committees participated at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\nKristina Krone qualified to compete in her second consecutive games for Puerto Rico, but the island's Olympic Committee once again chose not to send her to compete.[65] Similarly, South Africa decided not to send alpine skier Sive Speelman to Sochi.[66] Algeria also did not enter its only qualified athlete, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi.[67]\n\n\nIndia's athletes originally competed as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony, as India was originally suspended in December 2012 over the election process of the Indian Olympic Association.[68] On 11 February, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward.[69] Although Shiva Keshavan competed as an Independent athlete and is recorded as such, he was permitted to walk under the flag of India at the Closing Ceremony.\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the Winter Olympics\nYellow circle is host city (Sochi)\n\n![](image)Number of participating

sports. A total of twelve new events were contested, making it the largest Winter Olympics to date.[83]\n\n\n\n1. **Biathlon**\n\t* ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n2. **Bobsleigh**\n\t* ![](image) Bobsleigh (3) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n3. **Curling**\n\t* ![](image) Curling (2) (details)\n4. **Ice hockey**\n\t* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n5. **Luge**\n\t* ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n6. **Skating**\n\t* ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Short track speed skating (8) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Speed skating (12) (details)\n7. **Skiing**\n\t* ![](image) Alpine skiing (10) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Freestyle skiing (10) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Ski jumping (4) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Snowboarding (10) (details)\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.*\n\n\n\n#### New events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Postage stamps of Transnistria, Sochi Olympic Games (2014)\nOn 6 April 2011, the IOC accepted a number of events that were submitted by their respective sports federations to be considered for inclusion into the official program of these Olympic Games.[84]\nThe events included a Figure skating team event, Women's ski jumping, Mixed relay biathlon, Ski half-pipe, and Team relay luge.\n\n\nOn 4 July 2011, the IOC announced that three events would be added to the program.[85] These events, which were officially declared by Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge on 4 July 2011, were: Ski slopestyle, Snowboard slopestyle, Snowboard parallel special slalom.[86]\n\n\nTeam alpine skiing was also presented as a candidate for inclusion in the Olympic program but the Executive board of the IOC rejected this proposal. The International Ski Federation persisted with the nomination and this was considered.[87] There were reports of bandy possibly being added to the sports program,[88][89][90] but the IOC rejected this request. Subsequently, the international governing body, Federation of International Bandy, decided that Irkutsk and Shelekhov in Russia would host the 2014 Bandy World Championship just before the Olympics.\n\n\nOn 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include ski mountaineering,[91] ski-orienteering,[92] or winter triathlon[93] in the review process of the program.[93]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 23 February 2014 between 20:14 MSK (UTC+4) and 22:25 MSK (UTC+4) at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.[94]\nThe ceremony was dedicated to Russian culture featuring world-renowned Russian stars like conductor and violinist Yuri Bashmet, conductor Valery Gergiev, pianist Denis Matsuev, singer Hibla Gerzmava and violinist Tatiana Samouil. These artists were joined by performers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theaters.\n\n\n\n## Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2014 Winter Olympics\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics medal winners\n\nSochi's medal design was unveiled in May 2013. The design is intended to resemble Sochi's landscape, with a semi-translucent section containing a \"patchwork quilt\" of diamonds representing mountains; the diamonds themselves contain designs that reflect Russia's regions.[95] Those who won gold medals on 15 February received special medals with fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor, marking the one-year anniversary of the event where pieces of the cosmic body fell into the Chebarkul Lake in the Ural Mountains in central Russia.[96]\n\n\n\n### Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics medal table\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below.

To enter controlled areas, visitors were required to pass through security checkpoints with X-ray machines, metal detectors and explosive material scanners.[101] Several areas were designated as \"forbidden\", including Sochi National Park and the border with Abkhazia.[100][102] An unmanned aerial vehicle squadron, along with S-400 and Pantsir-S1 air defense rockets were used to protect Olympic airspace. Four gunboats were also deployed on the Black Sea to protect the coastline.[103]\n\n\nA number of security organizations and forces began stationing in and around Sochi in January 2014; Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) was stationed in Sochi for the Games beginning on 7 January 2014.[104][105] A group of 10,000 Internal Troops of the Ministry of Interior also provided security services during the Games.[106] In mid-January, 1,500 Siberian Regional Command troops were stationed in a military town near Krasnaya Polyana.[107] A group of 400 Cossacks in traditional uniforms were also present to accompany police patrols.[108][109] The 58th Army unit of the Russian Armed Forces were defending the Georgia–Russia border.[110] The United States also supplied Navy ships and other assets for security purposes.[111]\n\n\nAll communication and Internet traffic by Sochi residents was captured and filtered through deep packet inspection systems at all mobile networks using the SORM system.[112][113]\n\n\nFormer professional speed skater and current deputy of the Russian State Duma Svetlana Zhurova has stated that the 2014 Sochi Olympics were Vladimir Putin's personal project to showcase Russia to the world.[114]\n\n\n\n### Incidents and threats[edit]\n\n\nOrganizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged \"on the bones of many, many Muslims killed ... and buried on our lands extending to the Red Sea\".[115]\n\n\nThreats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or \"blow up\" athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters \"[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public\", the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games.[110][116][117]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nIn most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters: Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.[118]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.[119]\n\n\nIn Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and Réseau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group's TVA Sports.[120][121][122][123]\n\n\nIn Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.[124][125][126]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSeveral broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing. Olympic sponsor Panasonic filmed the opening ceremony in 4K.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia's policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government's denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors.[131][132][133][134][135] Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history, with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials,[136] and Allison Stewart of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms.[137] It was reported that Putin's annexation of Crimea may have been intended to distract local Russians from corruption stories related to the Games.[138][139]\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. broadcaster NBC largely avoided broadcasting material critical of Russia, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some commentators.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the closing ceremony, commentators evaluated the Games to have been successful overall.[141][142]\n\n\n\n### Circassian genocide[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Circassians in Turkey commemorate the Circassian genocide in Taksim, Istanbul\nSome Circassian organizations objected to the Games being held on land their ancestors held until 1864,[143][144] when most of them were vanquished at the end of the Russian-Circassian War (1763–1864), in the Circassian genocide[145][146] The use of Krasnaya Polyana (\"Red Hill\" or \"Red Glade\") as an event site was considered insensitive, as it was named for a group of Circassians who were defeated in a bloody battle with Russians while attempting to return home over it in 1864.[147][148] Some Circassian groups demanded that the Games be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for their actions.[149] Other groups did not outright object to the Games, but suggested that symbols of Circassian history and culture be incorporated into the Games, as Australia, the United States and Canada did for their indigenous cultures in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.[150]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, and Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nFollowing the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD,[151] and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by *The New York Times*—which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.[152][153] Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.[152][153][154][155]\n\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commissioned an independent report by Richard McLaren, which corroborated claims that Russian authorities had been discreetly swapping out urine samples that tested positive for performance-enhancing substances. The report concluded that the program had been operating from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\", and had covered up 643 positive samples across Olympic and non-Olympic sports.[156][157][158] As a result, WADA considered the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[159]\n\n\nRussia was not banned from the 2016 Olympics by the IOC, a decision that was widely criticized by both athletes[160][161][162] and writers;[163][164][165] the IOC only required Russia's athletes to be cleared by an internal panel and their respective sports federations.[166] The IAAF had suspended Russia from international track and field events due to the scandal, but did allow Darya Klishina to participate in the Olympics because she was confirmed not to be a part of a doping program, despite claims that surfaced in her appeal that a sample of Klishina's that had been collected on 26 February 2014 had yielded an illegal testosterone/epitestosterone ratio of 8.5 had been subject\nto a \"SAVE\" order by the Ministry of Sport on 3 March 2014.[167][168][169] The International Paralympic Committee suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee and banned the team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics.[170]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, thus banning it from sending athletes under the Russian flag to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cleared Russian athletes were allowed to participate as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR).[5][6] Two of them – curler Alexander Krushelnitskiy, who won a bronze medal, and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva – failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nThe IOC's Oswald Commission disqualified and banned 43 Russian athletes, and stripped thirteen medals they earned in Sochi.[171] In December 2017, 42 of the 43 punished athletes appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On 1 February 2018, the CAS found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence and cleared 28 athletes from IOC sanctions. In total, Russian athletes won back 9 of the 13 medals collected. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics.[172] The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC found it important to note that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent” and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision.[173][174] Later that month, the Russian Olympic Committee was reinstated by the IOC, despite failed doping tests during the 2018 Olympics,[175] and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was re-certified in September, despite the Russian officials not accepting the McLaren report.[176]\n\n\n\n### Subsequent events[edit]\n\n\nJust 4 days after the closing of the Games, Russian troops entered Ukrainian Crimea and started the formal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Russia formally incorporated Crimea into its territory on 14th March 2014.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n* ![flag](image)Russia portal\n* ![icon](image)2010s portal\n\n\n* 2014 Winter Paralympics\n* 2014 Summer Youth Olympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Sochi 2014 Facts & figures\" (PDF).

Since then, summer and winter games have usually celebrated a four-year period known as an Olympiad; summer and winter games normally held in staggered even years. There have been 29 Summer Olympic Games held in 21 cities, and 24 Winter Olympic Games held in 21 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Sapporo–Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) and Tokyo–Helsinki (summer) in 1940; and Cortina d'Ampezzo (winter) and London (summer) in 1944. The 1906 Intercalated Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens. However, in 1949, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games.[1][2] The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were postponed for the first time in the Olympics history to summer 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic with the 2022 Winter Olympics being held roughly six months later in Beijing.[3][4]\n\n\nFour cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games: Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics, Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo for the 2026 Winter Olympics, Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics, and Brisbane for the 2032 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nIn 2022, Beijing became the first city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games. Ten cities will have hosted the Olympic Games more than once: Athens (1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics), Paris (1900, 1924 and 2024 Summer Olympics), London (1908, 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics), St. Moritz (1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics), Lake Placid (1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics), Los Angeles (1932, 1984 and 2028 Summer Olympics), Cortina d'Ampezzo (1956 and 2026 Winter Olympics), Innsbruck (1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics), Tokyo (1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics) and Beijing (2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics). Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics. London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics. Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics, followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028.\n\n\nThe Games have primarily been hosted in the regions of Europe (30 editions) and the Americas (13 editions); eight Games have been hosted in Asia and two have been hosted in Oceania. Rio de Janeiro became South America's first Olympic host city with the 2016 Summer Olympics. Africa has yet to host an Olympic Games. Other major geographic regions which have never hosted the Olympics include the Middle East, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, Central America and the Caribbean. Between the first Winter Olympics in 1924 and the last ones to be held in the same year as the Summer Olympics in 1992, the Summer and Winter games took place in the same country three times.\n\n\nHost cities are selected by the IOC membership, usually seven years in advance.[5] The selection process lasts approximately two years. In the first stage, any city in the world may submit an application to become a host city. After 10 months, the Executive Board of the IOC decides which applicant cities will become official candidates as based on the recommendation of a working group that reviews the applications. In a second stage, the candidate cities are investigated thoroughly by an Evaluation Commission, which then submits a final short list of cities to be considered for selection. The host city is then chosen by vote of the IOC session, a general meeting of IOC members.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Olympic Games host cities[edit]\n\n\n### Host cities for Summer and Winter Olympic

events in 1920 were held in Ostend, Belgium and in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n4. **^** The 1940 Winter Olympics were originally awarded to Sapporo, Japan, but the launch of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 caused them to be relocated to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Nazi Germany, before being cancelled in 1939 because of the expansion of World War II.\n5. **^** The 1940 Summer Olympics were originally awarded to Tokyo, Japan, but the launch of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 caused them to be relocated Helsinki, Finland, before being cancelled in 1939 because of the expansion of World War II.\n6. **^** Equestrian events were held in Stockholm, Sweden. Stockholm had to bid for the equestrian competition separately; it received its own Olympic flame and had its own formal invitations and opening and closing ceremonies, just like the regular Summer Olympics.[20]\n7. **^** The 1976 Winter Olympics were originally awarded to Denver, Colorado, United States in 1970, but in 1972, after a referendum, Denver voluntarily gave up its right, citing environmental concerns for the Colorado area. The IOC eventually decided to relocate those games to Innsbruck, Austria.\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Russia (like the former Soviet Union) spans the continents of Europe and Asia. However, the Russian Olympic Committee is part of the European Olympic Committees and has its official seat in Moscow (this was also the case for the former Soviet Olympic Committee). Also, Moscow is on the European side of the most commonly recognized boundary between Europe and Asia (Sochi is in Asia per the usual geographic boundary, being just south of the Greater Caucasus' western end; but political approximations of the continental boundary place it in Europe).\n9. **^** Equestrian events were held in China's Hong Kong SAR.[21] Although Hong Kong's separate NOC conducted the equestrian competition, it was an integral part of the Beijing Games (unlike the 1956 Stockholm equestrian competition, it was not conducted under a separate Hong Kong bid, separate flame, etc.).[22]\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The 2020 Summer Olympics were originally scheduled for 24 July to 9 August 2020, but were rescheduled to 2021 by 12 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the event was still referred to as the 2020 Summer Olympics (marking the 32nd Olympiad) to preserve the 4-year Olympiad cycle.[3]\n11. **^** Surfing events will be held in France's overseas collectivity of French Polynesia.[23]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Findling, John E.; Pelle, Kimberly D.

Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.\n\n\nPrior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era's so-called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan's economy propelled to the second-largest in the world behind the United States.[10]\n\n\nTokyo, which is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, is Japan's leading business hub and part of an industrial region that includes Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2023[update], the city is home to 29 of the world's largest 500 companies listed in the annual *Fortune* Global 500.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan's high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city's administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tokyo |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)*Tōkyō* in *kanji*\n |\n| Japanese name |\n| Kanji | 東京 |\n| Hiragana | とうきょう |\n| Katakana | トウキョウ |\n| Kyūjitai | 東亰 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Romanization | Tōkyō |\n| Revised Hepburn | Toukyou |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (*e*, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (*to*, \"entrance, gate, door\").[17] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 *tō* \"east\", and 京 *kyō* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Tokyo.\n\n### Pre-1869 (Edo period)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edo\n\nSee also: Perry Expedition and Bakumatsu\n\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kantō region. When he became *shōgun* in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[21]\n\n\nEdo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868).[22] During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the *Pax Tokugawa*, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.[23] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\n\n\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.[24] Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.[25] Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa *shōgun*, Yoshinobu, in 1867.[26] After 265 years, the *Pax Tokugawa* came to an end.\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Edo Castle, 17th century](image)\n\nEdo Castle, 17th century\n* ![Commodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853](image)\n\nCommodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853\n* ![Famous Edo Places.

The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. Tokyo was already the nation's political center,[27] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889.\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927.[15] Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.[28]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![An aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930](image)\n\nAn aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930\n* ![Nihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923](image)\n\nNihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923\n* ![The Ginza area in 1933](image)\n\nThe Ginza area in 1933\n* ![\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927](image)\n\n\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927\n\n\n### 1943–1945[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bombing of Tokyo\n\nIn 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945–present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.[34]\n\n\nAfter the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world. The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 – the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991[35] – and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[36] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\n\n\nTokyo's subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[37] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\nYoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics\n* ![Sunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991](image)\n\nSunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991\n\n\n## Geography and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tokyo Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (都), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (市 *-shi*), five towns (町 *-chō* or *machi*), and eight villages (村 *-son* or *-mura*), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Tokyo Metropolis by population\n\n![](image)A map with Nishi-Tama District in green\n![](image)A map of the Izu Islands with black labels\n![](image)A map of the Ogasawara Islands with black labels\nSince 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of Japan has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of Tokyo's municipalities cover the area that had been Tokyo City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\n\n* The special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*) of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo – Chiyoda, Chūō and Minato – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country.[55] Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,[56] as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central Tokyo.\n* Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850 km (1,150 mi) from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu Ōshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, Kōzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachijō-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850 km (1,150 mi) the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan.[57] Japan's claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ.[58] The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag, name w/o suffix | Full name\n | District orSubprefecture | Population\n | LPE code(w/o checksum)

Municipal mergers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsuryō[*clarification needed*] districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\n\n\n\n### National parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ogasawara National Park, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Kyūryō, Hamura Kusabana Kyūryō, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Kyūryō Prefectural Natural Parks.[60]\n\n\nA number of museums are located in Ueno Park: Tokyo National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n#### Minor quakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Shibuya with instructions (in Japanese and English) in case of an earthquake\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Infrequent powerful quakes[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011;[62][63] the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\n\n\n\n### Volcanic eruptions[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji is about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MAOUDC is the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility.\nTokyo is located on the Kantō Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season.[67] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa.[68] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people.[67] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood.[67] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6–7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction.[67] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed.[67] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.[67]\n\n\nTokyo has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC).[14][67] It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3 km (3.9 mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72 ft) underground, with 70-meter (230 ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty.[67] During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River.[68] Low-lying areas of Kōtō, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Taitō and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*),[69] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 °C (80.4 °F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 °C (41.7 °F). The record low temperature was −9.2 °C (15.4 °F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 °C (86.5 °F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30 °C (86.0 °F).[70]\n\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0 in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain,[73] including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n | −7.9(17.8)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −6.8(19.8)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 56.5(2.22)\n | 116.0(4.57)\n | 133.7(5.26)\n | 139.7(5.50)\n | 167.8(6.61)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 154.7(6.09)\n | 224.9(8.85)\n | 234.8(9.24)\n | 96.3(3.79)\n | 57.9(2.28)\n | 1,598.2(62.92)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 8(3.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.5 mm) | 5.3\n | 6.1\n | 10.3\n | 10.9\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 12.0\n | 9.4\n | 12.3\n | 11.8\n | 8.2\n | 5.8\n | 116.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51\n | 52\n | 57\n | 62\n | 68\n | 75\n | 76\n | 74\n | 75\n | 71\n | 64\n | 56\n | 65\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | −5(23)\n | −4(25)\n | 1(34)\n | 8(46)\n | 13(55)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 23(73)\n | 19(66)\n | 12(54)\n | 6(43)\n | −1(30)\n | 9(49)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 192.6\n | 170.4\n | 175.3\n | 178.8\n | 179.6\n | 124.2\n | 151.4\n | 174.2\n | 126.7\n | 129.4\n | 149.8\n | 174.4\n | 1,926.7\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 61\n | 56\n | 47\n | 45\n | 41\n | 30\n | 34\n | 42\n | 34\n | 37\n | 48\n | 57\n | 44\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Japan Meteorological Agency[77][78][70] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[79] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985–2015)[80] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kantō.[86]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nArchitecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Tokyo from the Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding 1,000 ha (2,500 acres) of green space, 88 ha (220 acres) of which will be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" (Sea Forest) which will be on a reclaimed island in Tokyo Bay which used to be a landfill.[93] From 2007 to 2010, 436 ha (1,080 acres) of the planned 1,000 ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000. As of 2014[update], roadside trees in Tokyo have increased to 950,000, and a further 300 ha (740 acres) of green space has been added.[94]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tokyo prefecture population pyramid in 2020\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1870 | 590,268 | —     |\n| 1880 | 712,259 | +20.7% |\n| 1890 | 1,389,684 | +95.1% |\n| 1900 | 1,580,124 | +13.7% |\n| 1910 | 2,202,079 | +39.4% |\n| 1920 | 3,699,428 | +68.0% |\n| 1925 | 4,485,144 | +21.2% |\n| 1930 | 5,408,678 | +20.6% |\n| 1935 | 6,369,919 | +17.8% |\n| 1940 | 7,354,971 | +15.5% |\n| 1945 | 3,488,284 | −52.6% |\n| 1950 | 6,277,500 | +80.0% |\n| 1955 | 8,037,084 | +28.0% |\n| 1960 | 9,683,802 | +20.5% |\n| 1965 | 10,869,244 | +12.2% |\n| 1970 | 11,408,071 | +5.0% |\n| 1975 | 11,673,554 | +2.3% |\n| 1980 | 11,618,281 | −0.5% |\n| 1985 | 11,829,363 | +1.8% |\n| 1990 | 11,855,563 | +0.2% |\n| 1995 | 11,773,605 | −0.7% |\n| 2000 | 12,064,101 | +2.5% |\n| 2005 | 12,576,601 | +4.2% |\n| 2010 | 13,159,388 | +4.6% |\n| 2015 | 13,515,271 | +2.7% |\n| 2020 | 13,982,112 | +3.5% |\n\n\nAs of October 2012, the official intercensal estimate showed 13.506 million people in Tokyo, with 9.214 million living within Tokyo's 23 wards.[95] During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5 million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas. This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.[96]\n\n\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu.[97] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).[98]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Tokyo historical population since 1920 | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Registered foreign nationals**[99] |\n| Nationality | Population (2018)\n |\n| China | 199,949\n |\n| South Korea | 90,438\n |\n| Vietnam | 32,334\n |\n| Philippines | 32,089\n |\n| Nepal | 26,157\n |\n| Taiwan | 18,568\n |\n| North America (United States and Canada) | 17,578\n |\n| India | 11,153\n |\n| Myanmar | 9,719\n |\n| Thailand | 7,958\n |\n| Others | 75,557\n |\n\n |\n| ![](image)This chart is growth rate of municipalities of Tokyo, Japan.

According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo–Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2 trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.\n\n\nTokyo is a major international finance center;[100] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.[105] Tokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,[106] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. *Komatsuna* and spinach are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the *komatsuna* sold at its central produce market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijō-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and *aji* are among the ocean products.[107]\n\n\nTourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81 million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4 trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country's artwork national treasures (87/233).\n\n\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018.[108] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.[109]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\n\n![](image)Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo.\n![](image)Haneda Airport\n![](image)Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway are two main subway operators in Tokyo.\n![](image)Hamazakibashi JCT in Shuto Expressway\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\"[110] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\nNarita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at Ōta, offers domestic and international flights.\n\n\nVarious islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachijō-jima (Hachijojima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu Ōshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo International and other airports.\n\n\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo,[115] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.\n\n\nTwo different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and Shinjuku.\n\n\nExpressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kantō region, and the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were constructed above existing roads.[116] Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Tokyo\n\nSee also: List of universities in Tokyo\n\nTokyo has many universities, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Many of Japan's most prestigious universities are in Tokyo, including University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Meiji University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Tokyo University of Science, Sophia University, and Keio University.[117] Some of the biggest national universities in Tokyo are:\n\n\n\n* Hitotsubashi University\n* National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies\n* Ochanomizu University\n* Tokyo Gakugei University\n* Tokyo Institute of Technology\n* Tokyo Medical and Dental University\n* Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology\n* Tokyo University of Foreign Studies\n* Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology\n* Tokyo University of the Arts\n* University of Electro-Communications\n* University of Tokyo\n\nThere is only one non-national public university: Tokyo Metropolitan University. There are also a few universities well known for classes conducted in English and for the teaching of the Japanese language, including the Globis University Graduate School of Management, International Christian University, Sophia University, and Waseda University\n\n\nTokyo is also the headquarters of the United Nations University.\n\n\nMost publicly run kindergartens, elementary schools (years 1 through 6), and junior high (lower secondary) schools (7 through 9) are operated by local wards or municipal offices. Most public senior high (upper secondary) schools in Tokyo are run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education and are called \"Metropolitan High Schools\". Tokyo also has many private schools from kindergarten through high school:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![Yasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō](image)\n\nYasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō\n* ![Okuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku](image)\n\nOkuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku\n* ![Hibiya High School in Chiyoda](image)\n\nHibiya High School in Chiyoda\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, also known as \"Miraikan\"\n![](image)Takeshita Street in Harajuku\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum and specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\n\n\nTokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki.[118] Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama.[119] Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sanja Festival in Asakusa\nMany different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.\n\n\nHarajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion[120] and cosplay.\n\n\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.[121]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Tokyo\n\n![](image)Japan National Stadium\n![](image)Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo wrestling arena\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball clubs, the Yomiuri Giants who play at the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include F.C. Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy 1969, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Chōfu, and FC Machida Zelvia at Nozuta Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuchū) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuchū).\n\n\nBasketball clubs include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo and Tokyo Excellence.\n\n\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to a number of international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With a number of world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women's volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Akihabara is the most popular area for fans of anime, manga, and games.\n![](image)FCG Building, home of Fuji TV headquarters\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series' (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the *kaiju* (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.\n\n\nTokyo is also a popular foreign setting for non-Japanese media. Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include *Tokyo Joe*, *My Geisha*, *Tokyo Story* and the James Bond film *You Only Live Twice*; recent examples include *Kill Bill*, *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift*, *Lost in Translation*, *Babel*, *Inception*, *The Wolverine* and *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including *Norwegian Wood*), and David Mitchell's first two novels (*number9dream* and *Ghostwritten*) featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work depicting the city's crowded streets and public spaces.[123][124][125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\n\n\n\n### Sister cities and states[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan\n\nAs of 2022[update], Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:[128]\n\n\n\n* New York City, United States (since February 1960)\n* Beijing, China (since March 1979)\n* Paris, France (since July 1982)[129]\n* New South Wales, Australia (since May 1984)\n* Seoul, South Korea (since September 1988)\n* Jakarta, Indonesia (since October 1989)\n* São Paulo State, Brazil (since June 1990)\n* Cairo, Egypt (since October 1990)\n* Moscow, Russia (since July 1991)\n* Berlin, Germany (since May 1994)\n* Rome, Italy (since July 1996)\n* London, United Kingdom (since October 2015)\n\n### Friendship and cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.\n\n\nPrior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era's so-called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan's economy propelled to the second-largest in the world behind the United States.[10]\n\n\nTokyo, which is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, is Japan's leading business hub and part of an industrial region that includes Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2023[update], the city is home to 29 of the world's largest 500 companies listed in the annual *Fortune* Global 500.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan's high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city's administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tokyo |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)*Tōkyō* in *kanji*\n |\n| Japanese name |\n| Kanji | 東京 |\n| Hiragana | とうきょう |\n| Katakana | トウキョウ |\n| Kyūjitai | 東亰 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Romanization | Tōkyō |\n| Revised Hepburn | Toukyou |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (*e*, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (*to*, \"entrance, gate, door\").[17] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 *tō* \"east\", and 京 *kyō* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Tokyo.\n\n### Pre-1869 (Edo period)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edo\n\nSee also: Perry Expedition and Bakumatsu\n\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kantō region. When he became *shōgun* in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[21]\n\n\nEdo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868).[22] During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the *Pax Tokugawa*, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.[23] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\n\n\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.[24] Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.[25] Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa *shōgun*, Yoshinobu, in 1867.[26] After 265 years, the *Pax Tokugawa* came to an end.\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Edo Castle, 17th century](image)\n\nEdo Castle, 17th century\n* ![Commodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853](image)\n\nCommodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853\n* ![Famous Edo Places.

The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. Tokyo was already the nation's political center,[27] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889.\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927.[15] Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.[28]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![An aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930](image)\n\nAn aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930\n* ![Nihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923](image)\n\nNihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923\n* ![The Ginza area in 1933](image)\n\nThe Ginza area in 1933\n* ![\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927](image)\n\n\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927\n\n\n### 1943–1945[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bombing of Tokyo\n\nIn 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945–present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.[34]\n\n\nAfter the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world. The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 – the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991[35] – and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[36] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\n\n\nTokyo's subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[37] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\nYoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics\n* ![Sunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991](image)\n\nSunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991\n\n\n## Geography and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tokyo Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (都), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (市 *-shi*), five towns (町 *-chō* or *machi*), and eight villages (村 *-son* or *-mura*), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Tokyo Metropolis by population\n\n![](image)A map with Nishi-Tama District in green\n![](image)A map of the Izu Islands with black labels\n![](image)A map of the Ogasawara Islands with black labels\nSince 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of Japan has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of Tokyo's municipalities cover the area that had been Tokyo City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\n\n* The special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*) of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo – Chiyoda, Chūō and Minato – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country.[55] Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,[56] as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central Tokyo.\n* Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850 km (1,150 mi) from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu Ōshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, Kōzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachijō-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850 km (1,150 mi) the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan.[57] Japan's claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ.[58] The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag, name w/o suffix | Full name\n | District orSubprefecture | Population\n | LPE code(w/o checksum)

Municipal mergers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsuryō[*clarification needed*] districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\n\n\n\n### National parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ogasawara National Park, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Kyūryō, Hamura Kusabana Kyūryō, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Kyūryō Prefectural Natural Parks.[60]\n\n\nA number of museums are located in Ueno Park: Tokyo National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n#### Minor quakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Shibuya with instructions (in Japanese and English) in case of an earthquake\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Infrequent powerful quakes[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011;[62][63] the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\n\n\n\n### Volcanic eruptions[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji is about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MAOUDC is the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility.\nTokyo is located on the Kantō Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season.[67] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa.[68] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people.[67] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood.[67] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6–7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction.[67] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed.[67] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.[67]\n\n\nTokyo has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC).[14][67] It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3 km (3.9 mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72 ft) underground, with 70-meter (230 ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty.[67] During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River.[68] Low-lying areas of Kōtō, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Taitō and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*),[69] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 °C (80.4 °F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 °C (41.7 °F). The record low temperature was −9.2 °C (15.4 °F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 °C (86.5 °F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30 °C (86.0 °F).[70]\n\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0 in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain,[73] including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n | −7.9(17.8)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −6.8(19.8)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 56.5(2.22)\n | 116.0(4.57)\n | 133.7(5.26)\n | 139.7(5.50)\n | 167.8(6.61)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 154.7(6.09)\n | 224.9(8.85)\n | 234.8(9.24)\n | 96.3(3.79)\n | 57.9(2.28)\n | 1,598.2(62.92)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 8(3.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.5 mm) | 5.3\n | 6.1\n | 10.3\n | 10.9\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 12.0\n | 9.4\n | 12.3\n | 11.8\n | 8.2\n | 5.8\n | 116.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51\n | 52\n | 57\n | 62\n | 68\n | 75\n | 76\n | 74\n | 75\n | 71\n | 64\n | 56\n | 65\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | −5(23)\n | −4(25)\n | 1(34)\n | 8(46)\n | 13(55)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 23(73)\n | 19(66)\n | 12(54)\n | 6(43)\n | −1(30)\n | 9(49)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 192.6\n | 170.4\n | 175.3\n | 178.8\n | 179.6\n | 124.2\n | 151.4\n | 174.2\n | 126.7\n | 129.4\n | 149.8\n | 174.4\n | 1,926.7\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 61\n | 56\n | 47\n | 45\n | 41\n | 30\n | 34\n | 42\n | 34\n | 37\n | 48\n | 57\n | 44\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Japan Meteorological Agency[77][78][70] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[79] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985–2015)[80] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kantō.[86]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nArchitecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Tokyo from the Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding 1,000 ha (2,500 acres) of green space, 88 ha (220 acres) of which will be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" (Sea Forest) which will be on a reclaimed island in Tokyo Bay which used to be a landfill.[93] From 2007 to 2010, 436 ha (1,080 acres) of the planned 1,000 ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000. As of 2014[update], roadside trees in Tokyo have increased to 950,000, and a further 300 ha (740 acres) of green space has been added.[94]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tokyo prefecture population pyramid in 2020\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1870 | 590,268 | —     |\n| 1880 | 712,259 | +20.7% |\n| 1890 | 1,389,684 | +95.1% |\n| 1900 | 1,580,124 | +13.7% |\n| 1910 | 2,202,079 | +39.4% |\n| 1920 | 3,699,428 | +68.0% |\n| 1925 | 4,485,144 | +21.2% |\n| 1930 | 5,408,678 | +20.6% |\n| 1935 | 6,369,919 | +17.8% |\n| 1940 | 7,354,971 | +15.5% |\n| 1945 | 3,488,284 | −52.6% |\n| 1950 | 6,277,500 | +80.0% |\n| 1955 | 8,037,084 | +28.0% |\n| 1960 | 9,683,802 | +20.5% |\n| 1965 | 10,869,244 | +12.2% |\n| 1970 | 11,408,071 | +5.0% |\n| 1975 | 11,673,554 | +2.3% |\n| 1980 | 11,618,281 | −0.5% |\n| 1985 | 11,829,363 | +1.8% |\n| 1990 | 11,855,563 | +0.2% |\n| 1995 | 11,773,605 | −0.7% |\n| 2000 | 12,064,101 | +2.5% |\n| 2005 | 12,576,601 | +4.2% |\n| 2010 | 13,159,388 | +4.6% |\n| 2015 | 13,515,271 | +2.7% |\n| 2020 | 13,982,112 | +3.5% |\n\n\nAs of October 2012, the official intercensal estimate showed 13.506 million people in Tokyo, with 9.214 million living within Tokyo's 23 wards.[95] During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5 million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas. This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.[96]\n\n\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu.[97] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).[98]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Tokyo historical population since 1920 | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Registered foreign nationals**[99] |\n| Nationality | Population (2018)\n |\n| China | 199,949\n |\n| South Korea | 90,438\n |\n| Vietnam | 32,334\n |\n| Philippines | 32,089\n |\n| Nepal | 26,157\n |\n| Taiwan | 18,568\n |\n| North America (United States and Canada) | 17,578\n |\n| India | 11,153\n |\n| Myanmar | 9,719\n |\n| Thailand | 7,958\n |\n| Others | 75,557\n |\n\n |\n| ![](image)This chart is growth rate of municipalities of Tokyo, Japan.

According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo–Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2 trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.\n\n\nTokyo is a major international finance center;[100] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.[105] Tokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,[106] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. *Komatsuna* and spinach are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the *komatsuna* sold at its central produce market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijō-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and *aji* are among the ocean products.[107]\n\n\nTourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81 million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4 trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country's artwork national treasures (87/233).\n\n\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018.[108] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.[109]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\n\n![](image)Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo.\n![](image)Haneda Airport\n![](image)Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway are two main subway operators in Tokyo.\n![](image)Hamazakibashi JCT in Shuto Expressway\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\"[110] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\nNarita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at Ōta, offers domestic and international flights.\n\n\nVarious islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachijō-jima (Hachijojima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu Ōshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo International and other airports.\n\n\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo,[115] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.\n\n\nTwo different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and Shinjuku.\n\n\nExpressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kantō region, and the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were constructed above existing roads.[116] Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Tokyo\n\nSee also: List of universities in Tokyo\n\nTokyo has many universities, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Many of Japan's most prestigious universities are in Tokyo, including University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Meiji University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Tokyo University of Science, Sophia University, and Keio University.[117] Some of the biggest national universities in Tokyo are:\n\n\n\n* Hitotsubashi University\n* National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies\n* Ochanomizu University\n* Tokyo Gakugei University\n* Tokyo Institute of Technology\n* Tokyo Medical and Dental University\n* Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology\n* Tokyo University of Foreign Studies\n* Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology\n* Tokyo University of the Arts\n* University of Electro-Communications\n* University of Tokyo\n\nThere is only one non-national public university: Tokyo Metropolitan University. There are also a few universities well known for classes conducted in English and for the teaching of the Japanese language, including the Globis University Graduate School of Management, International Christian University, Sophia University, and Waseda University\n\n\nTokyo is also the headquarters of the United Nations University.\n\n\nMost publicly run kindergartens, elementary schools (years 1 through 6), and junior high (lower secondary) schools (7 through 9) are operated by local wards or municipal offices. Most public senior high (upper secondary) schools in Tokyo are run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education and are called \"Metropolitan High Schools\". Tokyo also has many private schools from kindergarten through high school:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![Yasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō](image)\n\nYasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō\n* ![Okuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku](image)\n\nOkuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku\n* ![Hibiya High School in Chiyoda](image)\n\nHibiya High School in Chiyoda\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, also known as \"Miraikan\"\n![](image)Takeshita Street in Harajuku\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum and specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\n\n\nTokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki.[118] Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama.[119] Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sanja Festival in Asakusa\nMany different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.\n\n\nHarajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion[120] and cosplay.\n\n\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.[121]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Tokyo\n\n![](image)Japan National Stadium\n![](image)Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo wrestling arena\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball clubs, the Yomiuri Giants who play at the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include F.C. Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy 1969, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Chōfu, and FC Machida Zelvia at Nozuta Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuchū) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuchū).\n\n\nBasketball clubs include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo and Tokyo Excellence.\n\n\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to a number of international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With a number of world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women's volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Akihabara is the most popular area for fans of anime, manga, and games.\n![](image)FCG Building, home of Fuji TV headquarters\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series' (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the *kaiju* (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.\n\n\nTokyo is also a popular foreign setting for non-Japanese media. Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include *Tokyo Joe*, *My Geisha*, *Tokyo Story* and the James Bond film *You Only Live Twice*; recent examples include *Kill Bill*, *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift*, *Lost in Translation*, *Babel*, *Inception*, *The Wolverine* and *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including *Norwegian Wood*), and David Mitchell's first two novels (*number9dream* and *Ghostwritten*) featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work depicting the city's crowded streets and public spaces.[123][124][125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\n\n\n\n### Sister cities and states[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan\n\nAs of 2022[update], Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:[128]\n\n\n\n* New York City, United States (since February 1960)\n* Beijing, China (since March 1979)\n* Paris, France (since July 1982)[129]\n* New South Wales, Australia (since May 1984)\n* Seoul, South Korea (since September 1988)\n* Jakarta, Indonesia (since October 1989)\n* São Paulo State, Brazil (since June 1990)\n* Cairo, Egypt (since October 1990)\n* Moscow, Russia (since July 1991)\n* Berlin, Germany (since May 1994)\n* Rome, Italy (since July 1996)\n* London, United Kingdom (since October 2015)\n\n### Friendship and cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The city is located high in the Brazilian highlands in the country's Central-West region. It was founded by President Juscelino Kubitschek on 21 April 1960, to serve as the new national capital. Brasília is estimated to be Brazil's third-most populous city after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.[1] Among major Latin American cities, it has the highest GDP per capita.[6]\n\n\nBrasília was a planned city developed by Lúcio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and Joaquim Cardozo in 1956 in a scheme to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location. The landscape architect was Roberto Burle Marx.[7][8] The city's design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector, and the Embassy Sector. Brasília was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 due to its modernist architecture and uniquely artistic urban planning.[9] It was named \"City of Design\" by UNESCO in October 2017 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.[10]\n\n\nBrasília is a planned city distinguished by its white, modern architecture, designed by Oscar Niemeyer. All three branches of Brazil's federal government are centered in the city: executive, legislative and judiciary. Brasília also hosts 124 foreign embassies.[11] The city's international airport connects it to all other major Brazilian cities and some international destinations, and it is the third-busiest airport in Brazil. It was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and hosted some of the football matches during the 2016 Summer Olympics; it also hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\nLaid out in the shape of an airplane, its \"fuselage\" is the Monumental Axis, a pair of wide avenue flanking a large park. In the \"cockpit\" is Praça dos Três Poderes, named for the 3 branches of government surrounding it. Brasília has a unique legal status, as it is an administrative region rather than a municipality like other cities in Brazil. The name \"Brasília\" is often used as a synonym for the Federal District as a whole, which is divided into 33 administrative regions, one of which (Plano Piloto) includes the area of the originally planned city and its federal government buildings. The rest of the Federal District plus Plano Piloto are considered by IBGE to make up Brasília's city area.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Brasília; Timeline of Brasília; History of Brazil; Planaltina, Federal District; Juscelino Kubitschek; Lúcio Costa; Oscar Niemeyer; Joaquim Cardozo; and Burle Marx\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The foundation stone of Brasilia, Centennial Hill, erected in 1922 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Brazil's independence\nBrazil's first capital was Salvador; in 1763 Rio de Janeiro became Brazil's capital and remained so until 1960. During this period, resources tended to be centered in Brazil's southeastern region, and most of the country's population was concentrated near its Atlantic coast.[12] Brasilia's geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. An article of the country's first republican constitution, dated 1891, states that the capital should be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a place close to the country's center.\n\n\nThe plan was conceived in 1827 by José Bonifácio, an advisor to Emperor Pedro I. He presented a plan to the General Assembly of Brazil for a new city called Brasilia, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Pedro I dissolved the Assembly.\n\n\nAccording to the legend, Italian saint Don Bosco in 1883 had a dream in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasilia's location.[13] In Brasilia today, many references to Bosco, who founded the Salesian order, are found throughout the city and one church parish in the city bears his name.[14]\n\n\n\n### Costa plan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban planner Lúcio Costa was the winner of the competition for the construction project of Brasília and played a key role in the city's landmarking.\n![](image)Plano Piloto\nJuscelino Kubitschek was elected President of Brazil in 1955. Upon taking office in January 1956, in fulfilment of his campaign pledge, he initiated the planning and construction of the new capital. The following year an international jury selected Lúcio Costa's plan to guide the construction of Brazil's new capital, Brasilia. Costa was a student of the famous modernist architect Le Corbusier, and some of modernism's architecture features can be found in his plan. Costa's plan was not as detailed as some of the plans presented by other architects and city planners. It did not include land use schedules, models, population charts or mechanical drawings; however, it was chosen by five out of six jurors because it had the features required to align the growth of a capital city.[15] Even though the initial plan was transformed over time, it oriented much of the construction and most of its features survived.\n\n\nBrasilia's accession as the new capital and its designation for the development of an extensive interior region inspired the symbolism of the plan. Costa used a cross-axial design indicating the possession and conquest of this new place with a cross,[16] often likened to a dragonfly, an airplane or a bird.[15] Costa's plan included two principal components, the Monumental Axis (east to west) and the Residential Axis (north to south). The Monumental Axis was assigned political and administrative activities, and is considered the body of the city with the style and simplicity of its buildings, oversized scales, and broad vistas and heights, producing the idea of Monumentality. This axis includes the various ministries, national congress, presidential palace, supreme court building and the television and radio tower.[16] The Residential Axis was intended to contain areas with intimate character and is considered the most important achievement of the plan; it was designed for housing and associated functions such as local commerce, schooling, recreation and churches, constituted of 96 superblocks [pt] limited to six-story buildings and 12 additional superblocks limited to three-story buildings;[15] Costa's intention with superblocks was to have small self-contained and self-sufficient neighborhoods and uniform buildings with apartments of two or three different categories, where he envisioned the integration of upper and middle classes sharing the same residential area.[16]\n\n\nThe urban design of the communal apartment blocks was based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and the superblocks on the North American Radburn layout from 1929.[17] Visually, the blocks were intended to appear absorbed by the landscape because they were isolated by a belt of tall trees and lower vegetation. Costa attempted to introduce a Brazil that was more equitable, he also designed housing for the working classes that was separated from the upper- and middle-class housing and was visually different, with the intention of avoiding slums (*favelas*) in the urban periphery.[15][18] The *superquadra* has been accused of being a space where individuals are oppressed and alienated to a form of spatial segregation.[19]\n\n\nOne of the main objectives of the plan was to allow the free flow of automobile traffic, the plan included lanes of traffic in a north–south direction (seven for each direction) for the Monumental Axis and three arterials (the W3, the Eixo and the L2) for the residential Axis;[16] the cul-de-sac access roads of the superblocks were planned to be the end of the main flow of traffic. And the reason behind the heavy emphasis on automobile traffic is the architect's desire to establish the concept of modernity in every level.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brasília in 1958. Only Asa Sul is already leased, and Ministries Esplanade is also visible.\n![](image)Construction of the Ministries Esplanade in 1959\n![](image)Brasilia in 1964\nThough automobiles were invented prior to the 20th century, mass production of vehicles in the early 20th made them widely available; thus, they became a symbol of modernity. The two small axes around the Monumental axis provide loops and exits for cars to enter small roads. Some argue that his emphasis of the plan on automobiles caused the lengthening of distances between centers and it attended only the necessities of a small segment of the population who owned cars.[15] But one can not ignore the bus transportation system in the city. The buses routes inside the city operate heavily on W3 and L2. Almost anywhere, including satellite cities, can be reached just by taking the bus and most of the Plano Piloto can be reached without transferring to other buses.\n\n\nLater, as the population of the city increased, the transportation system also played an important role in mediating the relationship between the Pilot plan and the satellite cities. Due to the larger influx of vehicles, traffic lights were introduced to the Momument Axis, which violates the concept of modernity and advancement the architect first employed. Additionally, the metro system in Brasilia was mainly built for inhabitants of satellite cities. Though this growth has made Brasilia no longer a pure utopia with incomparable modernity, the later development of traffic management, bus routes to satellite cities, and the metro system all serve as a remedy to the dystopia, enabling the citizens to enjoy the kind of modernity that was not carefully planned.\n\n\nAt the intersection of the Monumental and Residential Axis Costa planned the city center with the transportation center (Rodoviaria), the banking sector and the hotel sector,[16] near to the city center, he proposed an amusement center with theaters, cinemas and restaurants. Costa's Plan is seen as a plan with a sectoral tendency, segregating all the banks, the office buildings, and the amusement center.[15]\n\n\nOne of the main features of Costa's plan was that he presented a new city with its future shape and patterns evident from the beginning. This meant that the original plan included paving streets that were not immediately put into use; the advantage of this was that the original plan is hard to undo because he provided for an entire street network, but on the other hand, is difficult to adapt and mold to other circumstances in the future.[15] In addition, there has been controversy with the monumental aspect of Lúcio Costa's Plan, because it appeared to some as 19th century city planning, not modern 20th century in urbanism.[20]\n\n\nAn interesting analysis can be made of Brasilia within the context of Cold War politics and the association of Lúcio Costa's plan to the symbolism of aviation. From an architectural perspective, the airplane-shaped plan was certainly an homage to Le Corbusier and his enchantment with the aircraft as an architectural masterpiece. However, Brasilia was constructed soon after the end of World War II. Despite Brazil's minor participation in the conflict, the airplane shape of the city was key in envisioning the country as part of the newly globalized world, together with the victorious Allies.[21] Furthermore, Brasilia is a unique example of modernism both as a guideline for architectural design but also as a principle for organizing society. Modernism in Brasilia is explored in James Holston's book, *The Modernist City*.[22]\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nJuscelino Kubitschek, president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, ordered Brasilia's construction, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasilia was part of Juscelino's \"fifty years of prosperity in five\" plan. Already in 1892, the astronomer Louis Cruls, in the service of the Brazilian government, had investigated the site for the future capital. Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner[23] in 1957, with 5550 people competing. Oscar Niemeyer was the chief architect of most public buildings, Joaquim Cardozo was the structural engineer, and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer. Brasilia was built in 41 months, from 1956 to 21 April 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAerial view of downtown Brasília (Pilot Plan) along the Monumental Axis, especially the new Mane Garrincha Stadium (left), the National Congress and the Three Powers Plaza (right). The entire residential area of North Wing (*Asa Norte*) is seen in the middle of the image.\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brasilia from Hodoyoshi 1 satellite\n![](image)Map from OpenStreetMap, covering the Plano Piloto area of Brasília\nThe city sits at an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and more, high on the Brazilian Highlands in the country's center-western region. Paranoá Lake, a large artificial lake, was built to increase the amount of water available and to maintain the region's humidity. It has a marina, and hosts wakeboarders and windsurfers. Diving can also be practiced and one of the main attractions is Vila Amaury, an old village submerged in the lake. This is where the first construction workers of Brasilia used to live.[24]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nBrasilia has a tropical savanna climate (*Aw*, according to the Köppen climate classification), milder due to the elevation and with two distinct seasons: the rainy season, from October to April, and the dry season, from May to September.[25] The average temperature is 21.4 °C (70.5 °F).[26] September, at the end of the dry season, has the highest average maximum temperature, 29.1 °C (84.4 °F), and July has major and minor lower maximum average temperature, of 25.6 °C (78.1 °F) and 13.9 °C (57.0 °F), respectively.[27][28] Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22 °C (72 °F).[26] With 253.1 mm (10.0 in), November is the month with the highest rainfall of the year, while July is the lowest, with only 1.5 mm (0.1 in).[29] During the dry season, the city can have very low relative humidity levels, often below 30%.[30]\n\n\nAccording to the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), the record low temperature was 1.6 °C (34.9 °F) on 18 July 1975, and the record high was 36.4 °C (97.5 °F) on 18 October 2015[31] and 8 October 2020.[32][33] The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was 132.8 mm (5.2 in) on 15 November 1963.[34]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Brasília (1991–2020, extremes 1961–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 35.7(96.3)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 34.5(94.1)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.8(71.2)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 206.0(8.11)\n | 179.5(7.07)\n | 226.0(8.90)\n | 145.2(5.72)\n | 26.9(1.06)\n | 3.3(0.13)\n | 1.5(0.06)\n | 16.3(0.64)\n | 38.1(1.50)\n | 141.8(5.58)\n | 253.1(9.96)\n | 241.1(9.49)\n | 1,478.8(58.22)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 16\n | 14\n | 15\n | 9\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 10\n | 17\n | 18\n | 109\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.7\n | 74.2\n | 76.1\n | 72.2\n | 65.4\n | 58.8\n | 51.0\n | 43.5\n | 46.4\n | 58.8\n | 74.5\n | 76.0\n | 64.3\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 159.6\n | 158.9\n | 168.7\n | 200.8\n | 237.9\n | 247.6\n | 268.3\n | 273.5\n | 225.7\n | 191.3\n | 138.3\n | 145.0\n | 2,415.6\n |\n| Source 1: Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia[27][26][28][29][35][36][37] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[38] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of Brazil, and Immigration to Brazil\n\n![](image)Brasilia at night from ISS\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n| Race and ethnicity in Brasília |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 48.2% |\n| White |  | 42.2% |\n| Black |  | 7.7% |\n| Asian |  | 1.6% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.2% |\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, 2,469,489 people resided in Brasilia and its metropolitan area,[39] of whom 1,239,882 were Pardo (Multiracial) (48.2%), 1,084,418 White (42.2%), 198,072 Black (7.7%), 41,522 Asian (1.6%), and 6,128 Amerindian (0.2%).[40]\n\n\nIn 2010, Brasilia was ranked the fourth-most populous city in Brazil after São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador.[41] In 2010, the city had 474,871 opposite-sex couples and 1,241 same-sex couples. The population of Brasilia was 52.2% female and 47.8% male.[40]\n\n\nIn the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal district. By 1970 this figure had grown to 537,000. By 2010 the population of the Federal District had surpassed 2,5 million. The city of Brasilia proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529,[42] but its metropolitan area within the Federal District has grown past this figure.[43]\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the growth of Brasilia was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasilia would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasilia, seeking public and private employment.[44]\n\n\nAt the close of the 20th century, Brasilia was the largest city in the world which had not existed at the beginning of the century.[45] Brasilia has one of the highest population growth rates in Brazil, with annual growth of 2.82%, mostly due to internal migration.\n\n\nBrasilia's inhabitants include a foreign population of mostly embassy workers as well as large numbers of Brazilian internal migrants. Today, the city has important communities of immigrants and refugees. The city's Human Development Index was 0.936 in 2000 (developed level), and the city's literacy rate was around 95.65%.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of Brasilia\nChristianity is by far the most prevalent religion in Brasília, with Roman Catholicism being the largest denomination.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Religion\n | Percentage\n | Number\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Catholic | 56.62%\n | 1,455,134\n |\n| Protestant | 26.88%\n | 690,982\n |\n| No religion | 9.20%\n | 236,528\n |\n| Other\n | 3.72%\n | 95,605\n |\n| Spiritist | 3.50%\n | 89,836\n |\n| Jewish | 0.04%\n | 1,103\n |\n| Muslim | 0.04%\n | 972\n |\n| Total\n | 100.00%\n | 2,570,160\n |\n\n\n*Source: IBGE 2010.[46]* \n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Constitution of Brazil\n\n![](image)Palácio Buriti, seat of government of the Federal District\nBrasília does not have a mayor or councillors, because article 32 of the Constitution of Brazil expressly prohibits the Federal District being divided into municipalities.\n\n\nThe Federal District is a legal entity of internal public law, which is part of the political-administrative structure of Brazil of a *sui generis* nature, because it is neither a state nor a municipality, but rather a special entity that incorporates the legislative powers reserved to the states and municipalities, as provided in Article 32, § 1º of the Constitution, which gives it a hybrid nature, both state and municipal.[47]\n\n\nThe executive power of the Federal District was represented by the mayor of the Federal District until 1969, when the position was transformed into governor of the Federal District.[48][49]\n\n\nThe legislative power of the Federal District is represented by the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District, whose nomenclature includes a mixture of legislative assembly (legislative power of the other units of the federation) and of municipal chamber (legislative of the municipalities). The Legislative Chamber is made up of 24 district deputies.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Legislative Chamber of the Federal District building\nThe judicial power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories as it is constituted, but Brazil does not have any territories. Therefore, the Court of Justice of the Federal District and of the Territories only serves the Federal District.\n\n\nPart of the budget of the Federal District Government comes from the Constitutional Fund of the Federal District. In 2012, the fund totaled 9.6 billion reais.[51] By 2015, the forecast is 12.4 billion reais, of which more than half (6.4 billion) is spent on public security spending.[52]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nBrasilia is twinned with:[53]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) **Abuja**, Nigeria[53]\n* ![](image) **Asunción**, Paraguay[53]\n* ![](image) **Brussels**, Belgium[53]\n* ![](image) **Buenos Aires**, Argentina *(since 2002)*[53]\n* ![](image) **Gaza City**, Palestine[53]\n* ![](image) **Havana**, Cuba[53]\n* ![](image) **Khartoum**, Sudan[53]\n* ![](image) **Lisbon**, Portugal[54]\n* ![](image) **Luxor**, Egypt[53]\n* ![](image) **Montevideo**, Uruguay[53]\n* ![](image) **Pretoria**, South Africa[53]\n* ![](image) **Santiago**, Chile[53]\n* ![](image) **Tehran**, Iran[53]\n* ![](image) **Vienna**, Austria[53]\n* ![](image) **Washington, D.C.**, United States *(since 2013)*[55]\n* ![](image) **Xi'an**, China *(since 1997)*[53]\n* ![](image) **Guadalajara**, Mexico.[56]\n\nOf these, Abuja and Washington, D.C. were also cities specifically planned as the seat of government of their respective countries.\n\n\n\nBrasília Declarations\nBrasília is associated with several significant declarations in the international political and social field, including:\n\n\n\n* The Brasília Declaration of the IBSA Dialogue Forum (2003), signed by the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA) regarding representation at the United Nations Security Council\n* Brasília Declaration on the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons in the Americas (2010)[57]\n* Brasília Declaration on Child Labour (2013), issued by the Third Global Conference on Child Labour – hosted in Brasília by the Brazilian Government[58]\n* Brasília Declaration of Judges on Water Justice (2018), adopted in 2018 during the Conference of Judges and Prosecutors on Water Justice at the 8th World Water Forum, described as \"a landmark in [the] development of water justice jurisprudence\"[59]\n* The 15th Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas, meeting in Brasília in 2022, issued a Declaration condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[60]\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Brazil\n\n![](image)South Banking Sector\n![](image)South Hotel Sector\n![](image)Brasília products treemap, 2020\nThe major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Brasilia's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center.\n\n\nIndustries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software. The gross domestic product (GDP) is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.[61]\n\n\nBesides being the political center, Brasilia is an important economic center. In 2018, it has the third highest GDP of cities in Brazil, R$254 billion reais,[62] representing 3.6% of the total Brazilian GDP. Most economic activity in the federal capital results from its administrative function.\n\n\nIts industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District. Being a city registered by UNESCO,[63] the government in Brasilia has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software, film, video, and gemology among others, with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance, preserving the city property.\n\n\nAccording to Mercer's city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, Brasilia ranks 45th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2012, up from the 70th position in 2010, ranking behind São Paulo (12th) and Rio de Janeiro (13th).\n\n\n\n### Industries[edit]\n\n\nIndustries in the city include construction (Paulo Octavio, Via Construções, and Irmãos Gravia among others); food processing (Perdigão, Sadia); furniture making; recycling (Novo Rio, Rexam, Latasa and others); pharmaceuticals (União Química); and graphic industries. The main agricultural products produced in the city are coffee, guavas, strawberries, oranges, lemons, papayas, soybeans, and mangoes. It has over 110,000 cows and it exports wood products worldwide.\n\n\nThe Federal District, where Brasilia is located, has a GDP of R$133,4 billion (about US$64.1 billion), about the same as Belarus according to The Economist. Its share of the total Brazilian GDP is about 3.8%.[64] The Federal District has the largest GDP per capita income of Brazil US$25,062, slightly higher than Belarus.[64]\n\n\nThe city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including accommodation, Hotels Sectors North and South. New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere, such as the hotels and tourism Sector North, located on the shores of Lake Paranoá.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of Brazil\n\n![](image)Cultural Complex of the Republic\nAs a venue for political events, music performances and movie festivals, Brasilia is a cosmopolitan city, with around 124 embassies, a wide range of restaurants and a complete infrastructure ready to host any kind of event. Not surprisingly, the city stands out as an important business/tourism destination, which is an important part of the local economy, with dozens of hotels spread around the federal capital. Traditional parties take place throughout the year.\n\n\nIn June, large festivals known as \"festas juninas\" are held celebrating Catholic saints such as Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Peter. On 7 September, the traditional Independence Day parade is held on the Ministries Esplanade. Throughout the year, local, national, and international events are held throughout the city. Christmas is widely celebrated, and New Year's Eve usually hosts major events celebrated in the city.[65]\n\n\nThe city also hosts a varied assortment of art works from artists like Bruno Giorgi, Alfredo Ceschiatti, Athos Bulcão, Marianne Peretti, Alfredo Volpi, Di Cavalcanti, Dyllan Taxman, Victor Brecheret and Burle Marx, whose works have been integrated into the city's architecture, making it a unique landscape. The cuisine in the city is very diverse. Many of the best restaurants in the city can be found in the Asa Sul district.[66]\n\n\nThe city is the birthplace of Brazilian rock and place of origin of bands like: Legião Urbana, Capital Inicial, Aborto Elétrico, Plebe Rude and Raimundos. Brasilia has the Rock Basement Festival which brings new bands to the national scene. The festival is held in the parking Brasilia National Stadium Mané Garrincha.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cláudio Santoro National Theater\nSince 1965, the annual Brasilia Festival of Brazilian Cinema is one of the most traditional cinema festivals in Brazil, being compared only to the Brazilian Cinema Festival of Gramado, in Rio Grande do Sul. The difference between both is that the festival in Brasilia still preserves the tradition to only submit and reward Brazilian movies.\n\n\nThe International Dance Seminar in Brasilia has brought top-notch dance to the Federal Capital since 1991. International teachers, shows with choreographers and guest groups and scholarships abroad are some of the hallmarks of the event. The Seminar is the central axis of the DANCE BRAZIL program and is promoted by the DF State Department of Culture in partnership with the Cultural Association Claudio Santoro. [1]\n\n\nBrasilia has also been the focus of modern-day literature. Published in 2008, *The World In Grey: Dom Bosco's Prophecy*, by author Ryan J. Lucero, tells an apocalyptical story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco.[67] According to Don Bosco's prophecy:[68] \"Between parallels 15 and 20, around a lake which shall be formed; A great civilization will thrive, and that will be the Promised Land\". Brasilia lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S, where an artificial lake (Paranoá Lake) was formed. Don Bosco is Brasilia's patron saint.\n\n\n*American Flagg!*, the First Comics comic book series created by Howard Chaykin, portrays Brasilia as a cosmopolitan world capital of culture and exotic romance. In the series, it is a top vacation and party destination. The 2015 Rede Globo series *Felizes para Sempre?* was set in Brasilia.[69]\n\n\n\n### Architecture and urbanism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brazilian Flag and the National Congress in spring\nAt the Square of Three Powers, Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and Brazilian structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo made buildings in the style of modern Brazilian architecture.[70] The Congress also occupies various other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels.\n\n\nThe National Congress building is located in the middle of the Eixo Monumental, the city's main avenue. In front lies a large lawn and reflecting pool. The building faces the Praça dos Três Poderes where the Palácio do Planalto and the Supreme Federal Court are located. The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings. In residential areas, buildings were built that were inspired in French modernist and bauhaus design.[71]\n\n\nAlthough not fully accomplished, the \"Brasilia utopia\" has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the **superquadras**) surrounded by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafés; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit.[72] Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname \"ilha da fantasia\" (\"fantasy island\"), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the states of Goiás and Minas Gerais, around Brasilia.[72]\n\n\nCritics of Brasilia's grand scale have characterized it as a modernist bauhaus platonic fantasy about the future:\n\n\n\n![](image)The Monumental Axis\n![](image)Aerial view of South Wing (*Asa Sul*) district\n![](image)Monumental Axis and Brasilia TV Tower\n\n> Nothing dates faster than people's fantasies about the future. This is what you get when perfectly decent, intelligent, and talented men start thinking in terms of space rather than place; and single rather than multiple meanings. It's what you get when you design for political aspirations rather than real human needs. You get miles of jerry-built platonic nowhere infested with Volkswagens. This, one may fervently hope, is the last experiment of its kind. The utopian buck stops here.\n> \n> — Robert Hughes, *The Shock of the New*, Episode 4: \"Trouble in Utopia\", (1980)\n> \n\n\n#### Notable structures[edit]\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Brasilia in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is an expression of the atheist architect Oscar Niemeyer and the structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo. This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure, seems with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens.\n\n\nThe cathedral's structure was finished on 31 May 1970, and only the 70 m (229.66 ft) diameter of the circular area were visible. Niemeyer's and Cardozo's project of Cathedral of Brasilia is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. There is controversy as to what these columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent, some say they are two hands moving upwards to heaven, others associate it to the chalice Jesus used in the last supper and some claim it represent his crown of thorns. The cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970.\n\n\nAt the end of the *Eixo Monumental* (\"Monumental Axis\") lies the *Esplanada dos Ministérios* (\"Ministries Esplanade\"),[73] an open area in downtown Brasilia. The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many government buildings, monuments and memorials are located. On Sundays and holidays, the Eixo Monumental is closed to cars so that locals may use it as a place to walk, bike, and have picnics under the trees.\n\n\n*Praça dos Três Poderes* (Portuguese for *Square of the Three Powers*) is a plaza in Brasilia. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the Executive, represented by the Palácio do Planalto (presidential office); the Legislative, represented by the National Congress (Congresso Nacional); and the Judiciary branch, represented by the Supreme Federal Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal). It is a tourist attraction in Brasilia, designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.\n\n\n\n![](image)Praça dos Três Poderes (Three Powers Plaza)\n![](image)The Palácio da Alvorada\nThe Palácio da Alvorada is the official residence of the president of Brazil. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasilia, by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958. One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the \"Alvorada\" lies on a peninsula at the shore of Lake Paranoá.\n\n\nThe principles of simplicity and modernity that in the past characterized the great works of architecture motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landing on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor.\n\n\nThe auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.\n\n\nThe Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the president of Brazil. It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasilia. As the seat of government, the term \"Planalto\" is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto.\n\n\nThe President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the Palácio da Alvorada. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the \"Planalto\", including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff. The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios. The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer, creator of most of the important buildings in Brasilia. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000 m2. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the University of Brasilia\nSee also: Education in Brazil\n\nThe city has six international schools: American School of Brasilia, Brasilia International School (BIS), Escola das Nações, Swiss International School (SIS), Lycée français François-Mitterrand (LfFM) and Maple Bear Canadian School.[74] August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school – the British School of Brasilia. Brasilia has two universities, three university centers, and many private colleges.\n\n\nThe main tertiary educational institutions are: Universidade de Brasilia – University of Brasilia (UnB) (public); Universidade Católica de Brasilia – Catholic University of Brasilia (UCB); Centro Universitário de Brasilia (UniCEUB); Centro Universitário Euroamaricano (Unieuro); Centro Universitário do Distrito Federal [pt] (UDF); Universidade Paulista [pt] (UNIP); and Instituto de Educação Superior de Brasilia (IESB).\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe average commute time on public transit in Brasilia, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 96 min. 31% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 28 min, while 61% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 15.1 km (9.4 mi), while 50% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.[75]\n\n\n\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brasília International Airport\n\n![](image)Brasilia International Airport (BSB)\n![](image)Aerial view of the airport\nBrasilia–Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights. It is the third busiest Brazilian airport based on passengers and aircraft movements.[76] Because of its strategic location it is a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This results in a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in a holding pattern before landing. Following the airport's master plan, Infraero built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. In 2007, the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers.[76] The main building's third floor, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theaters with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. Brasilia Airport has 136 vendor spaces. The airport is located about 11 km (6.8 mi) from the central area of Brasilia, outside the metro system. The area outside the airport's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services that connect the airport to Brasilia's central district. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars.[77]\n\n\nThe airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca), in addition to a number of international carriers. In 2012, Brasilia's International Airport was won by the InfraAmerica consortium, formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company, with a 50% stake each.[78] During the 25-year concession, the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year.[79]\n\n\nIn 2014 the airport received 15 new boarding bridges, totaling 28 in all. This was the main requirement made by the federal government, which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction. The group invested R$750 million in the project. In the same year, the number of parking spaces doubled, reaching three thousand. The airport's entrance has a new rooftop cover and a new access road. Furthermore, a VIP room was created on Terminal 1's third floor. The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasilia's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014.[80] Brasília Air Force Base - ALA1, one of their most important bases of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in Brasília.\n\n\n\n### Road transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge\nLike most Brazilian cities, Brasilia has a good network of taxi companies. Taxis from the airport are available outside the terminal, but at times there can be quite a queue of people. Although the airport is not far from the downtown area, taxi prices do seem to be higher than in other Brazilian cities. Booking in advance can be advantageous, particularly if time is limited, and local companies should be able to assist airport transfer or transport requirements.\n\n\nThe Juscelino Kubitschek bridge, also known as the 'President JK Bridge' or the 'JK Bridge', crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasilia. It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek, former president of Brazil. It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde. Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal[81] for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to \"...outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment, aesthetic merit and successful community participation\". It consists of three 60 m (200 ft) tall asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally. With a length of 1,200 m (0.75 miles), it was completed in 2002 at a cost of US$56.8 million. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to bicyclists and skaters.\n\n\n\n![](image)Central Bus Station\nThe main bus hub in Brasilia is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the Eixo Monumental and the Eixão, about 2 km (1.2 mi) from the Three Powers Plaza. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasilia. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasilia and others connecting Brasilia to the satellite cities. In the original city plan, the interstate buses would also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasilia (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferroviária) located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station. A new bus station was opened in July 2010. It is on Saída Sul (South Exit) near Parkshopping Mall with its metro station, and is also an inter-state bus station, used only to leave the Federal District.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Federal District Metro\nThere is no passenger rail service in Brasilia, but the Expresso Pequi rail line is planned to link Brasilia and Goiânia. A 22 km light rail line is planned, estimated to cost between 1 billion reais (US$258 million) and 1.5 billion reais with capacity to transport around 200,000 passengers per day.[82]\n\n\nThe Federal District Metro is Federal District's underground metro system. The system has 24 stations on two lines, the Orange and Green lines, along a total network of 43 km (27 mi), covering some of the Federal District. Both lines begin at the Central Station and run parallel until the Águas Claras Station. The Federal District Metro is not comprehensive so buses may provide better access to the center. The metro leaves the Rodoviária (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities, such as Samambaia, Taguatinga and Ceilândia, as well as Guará and Águas Claras. The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself (the census of 2000 indicated that Ceilândia had 344,039 inhabitants, Taguatinga had 243,575, and the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants), and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation.[83]\n\n\nA high-speed railway was planned between Brasilia and Goiânia, the capital of the state of Goias, but it will probably be turned into a regional service linking the capital cities and cities in between, like Anápolis and Alexânia.[84]\n\n\n\n## Sport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Estádio Nacional de Brasilia\nThe main stadiums are the Brasilia National Stadium Mané Garrincha (which was re-inaugurated on 18 May 2013), the Serejão Stadium (home for Brasiliense) and the Bezerrão Stadium (home for Gama).\n\n\nBrasilia was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, for which Brazil is the host nation. Brasilia hosted the opening of the Confederations Cup and hosted 7 World Cup games.[85] Brasilia also hosted the football tournaments during the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n![](image)Nilson Nelson Gymnasium\nBrasilia is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports, sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings. Practitioners of such sports reveal that, because of the city's dry weather, the city offers strong thermal winds and great \"cloud-streets\", which is also the name for a maneuver quite appreciated by practitioners. In 2003, Brasilia hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship, one of the categories of free flying. In August 2005, the city hosted the second stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship.\n\n\nBrasilia is the site of the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet which hosted a non-championship round of the 1974 Formula One Grand Prix season. An IndyCar race was cancelled at the last minute in 2015. The track, which has been closed since 2015, is being renovated for the end of 2023.\n\n\nThe city is also home to Uniceub BRB, one of Brazil's best basketball clubs, who became NBB champion in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The club hosts some of its games at the 16,000 all-seat Nilson Nelson Gymnasium.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Brazil portal\n* ![map](image)Latin America portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* List of purpose-built national capitals\n\n\n**Purpose-built Brazilian state capitals**\n\n\n\n* Aracaju\n* Belo Horizonte\n* Boa Vista\n* Palmas\n* Teresina\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The administrative region of Brasília recorded a population of 214,529 in a 2012 survey; IBGE demographic publications do not make this distinction and considers the entire population of the Federal District.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** IBGE: Brasília Archived 17 October 2013 at the Wayback Machine IBGE.

Brasília was not, in fact, planned in any meaningful way. The Brazilian architect and planner Lúcio Costa's entry for the design competition for the new city in 1956 was a series of sketches of ideal urban forms of communal apartment blocks loosely based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and 'superblocks' of single-family houses based on the North American Radburn layout (1929). He subsequently elaborated these into the Plano Piloto (Pilot Plan), and added the satellite city of Taguatinga.\n18. **^** Peter William Kellett; Felipe Hernández; Lea Knudsen Allen, eds.

The city is located high in the Brazilian highlands in the country's Central-West region. It was founded by President Juscelino Kubitschek on 21 April 1960, to serve as the new national capital. Brasília is estimated to be Brazil's third-most populous city after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.[1] Among major Latin American cities, it has the highest GDP per capita.[6]\n\n\nBrasília was a planned city developed by Lúcio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and Joaquim Cardozo in 1956 in a scheme to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location. The landscape architect was Roberto Burle Marx.[7][8] The city's design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector, and the Embassy Sector. Brasília was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 due to its modernist architecture and uniquely artistic urban planning.[9] It was named \"City of Design\" by UNESCO in October 2017 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.[10]\n\n\nBrasília is a planned city distinguished by its white, modern architecture, designed by Oscar Niemeyer. All three branches of Brazil's federal government are centered in the city: executive, legislative and judiciary. Brasília also hosts 124 foreign embassies.[11] The city's international airport connects it to all other major Brazilian cities and some international destinations, and it is the third-busiest airport in Brazil. It was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and hosted some of the football matches during the 2016 Summer Olympics; it also hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\nLaid out in the shape of an airplane, its \"fuselage\" is the Monumental Axis, a pair of wide avenue flanking a large park. In the \"cockpit\" is Praça dos Três Poderes, named for the 3 branches of government surrounding it. Brasília has a unique legal status, as it is an administrative region rather than a municipality like other cities in Brazil. The name \"Brasília\" is often used as a synonym for the Federal District as a whole, which is divided into 33 administrative regions, one of which (Plano Piloto) includes the area of the originally planned city and its federal government buildings. The rest of the Federal District plus Plano Piloto are considered by IBGE to make up Brasília's city area.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Brasília; Timeline of Brasília; History of Brazil; Planaltina, Federal District; Juscelino Kubitschek; Lúcio Costa; Oscar Niemeyer; Joaquim Cardozo; and Burle Marx\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The foundation stone of Brasilia, Centennial Hill, erected in 1922 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Brazil's independence\nBrazil's first capital was Salvador; in 1763 Rio de Janeiro became Brazil's capital and remained so until 1960. During this period, resources tended to be centered in Brazil's southeastern region, and most of the country's population was concentrated near its Atlantic coast.[12] Brasilia's geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. An article of the country's first republican constitution, dated 1891, states that the capital should be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a place close to the country's center.\n\n\nThe plan was conceived in 1827 by José Bonifácio, an advisor to Emperor Pedro I. He presented a plan to the General Assembly of Brazil for a new city called Brasilia, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Pedro I dissolved the Assembly.\n\n\nAccording to the legend, Italian saint Don Bosco in 1883 had a dream in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasilia's location.[13] In Brasilia today, many references to Bosco, who founded the Salesian order, are found throughout the city and one church parish in the city bears his name.[14]\n\n\n\n### Costa plan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban planner Lúcio Costa was the winner of the competition for the construction project of Brasília and played a key role in the city's landmarking.\n![](image)Plano Piloto\nJuscelino Kubitschek was elected President of Brazil in 1955. Upon taking office in January 1956, in fulfilment of his campaign pledge, he initiated the planning and construction of the new capital. The following year an international jury selected Lúcio Costa's plan to guide the construction of Brazil's new capital, Brasilia. Costa was a student of the famous modernist architect Le Corbusier, and some of modernism's architecture features can be found in his plan. Costa's plan was not as detailed as some of the plans presented by other architects and city planners. It did not include land use schedules, models, population charts or mechanical drawings; however, it was chosen by five out of six jurors because it had the features required to align the growth of a capital city.[15] Even though the initial plan was transformed over time, it oriented much of the construction and most of its features survived.\n\n\nBrasilia's accession as the new capital and its designation for the development of an extensive interior region inspired the symbolism of the plan. Costa used a cross-axial design indicating the possession and conquest of this new place with a cross,[16] often likened to a dragonfly, an airplane or a bird.[15] Costa's plan included two principal components, the Monumental Axis (east to west) and the Residential Axis (north to south). The Monumental Axis was assigned political and administrative activities, and is considered the body of the city with the style and simplicity of its buildings, oversized scales, and broad vistas and heights, producing the idea of Monumentality. This axis includes the various ministries, national congress, presidential palace, supreme court building and the television and radio tower.[16] The Residential Axis was intended to contain areas with intimate character and is considered the most important achievement of the plan; it was designed for housing and associated functions such as local commerce, schooling, recreation and churches, constituted of 96 superblocks [pt] limited to six-story buildings and 12 additional superblocks limited to three-story buildings;[15] Costa's intention with superblocks was to have small self-contained and self-sufficient neighborhoods and uniform buildings with apartments of two or three different categories, where he envisioned the integration of upper and middle classes sharing the same residential area.[16]\n\n\nThe urban design of the communal apartment blocks was based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and the superblocks on the North American Radburn layout from 1929.[17] Visually, the blocks were intended to appear absorbed by the landscape because they were isolated by a belt of tall trees and lower vegetation. Costa attempted to introduce a Brazil that was more equitable, he also designed housing for the working classes that was separated from the upper- and middle-class housing and was visually different, with the intention of avoiding slums (*favelas*) in the urban periphery.[15][18] The *superquadra* has been accused of being a space where individuals are oppressed and alienated to a form of spatial segregation.[19]\n\n\nOne of the main objectives of the plan was to allow the free flow of automobile traffic, the plan included lanes of traffic in a north–south direction (seven for each direction) for the Monumental Axis and three arterials (the W3, the Eixo and the L2) for the residential Axis;[16] the cul-de-sac access roads of the superblocks were planned to be the end of the main flow of traffic. And the reason behind the heavy emphasis on automobile traffic is the architect's desire to establish the concept of modernity in every level.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brasília in 1958. Only Asa Sul is already leased, and Ministries Esplanade is also visible.\n![](image)Construction of the Ministries Esplanade in 1959\n![](image)Brasilia in 1964\nThough automobiles were invented prior to the 20th century, mass production of vehicles in the early 20th made them widely available; thus, they became a symbol of modernity. The two small axes around the Monumental axis provide loops and exits for cars to enter small roads. Some argue that his emphasis of the plan on automobiles caused the lengthening of distances between centers and it attended only the necessities of a small segment of the population who owned cars.[15] But one can not ignore the bus transportation system in the city. The buses routes inside the city operate heavily on W3 and L2. Almost anywhere, including satellite cities, can be reached just by taking the bus and most of the Plano Piloto can be reached without transferring to other buses.\n\n\nLater, as the population of the city increased, the transportation system also played an important role in mediating the relationship between the Pilot plan and the satellite cities. Due to the larger influx of vehicles, traffic lights were introduced to the Momument Axis, which violates the concept of modernity and advancement the architect first employed. Additionally, the metro system in Brasilia was mainly built for inhabitants of satellite cities. Though this growth has made Brasilia no longer a pure utopia with incomparable modernity, the later development of traffic management, bus routes to satellite cities, and the metro system all serve as a remedy to the dystopia, enabling the citizens to enjoy the kind of modernity that was not carefully planned.\n\n\nAt the intersection of the Monumental and Residential Axis Costa planned the city center with the transportation center (Rodoviaria), the banking sector and the hotel sector,[16] near to the city center, he proposed an amusement center with theaters, cinemas and restaurants. Costa's Plan is seen as a plan with a sectoral tendency, segregating all the banks, the office buildings, and the amusement center.[15]\n\n\nOne of the main features of Costa's plan was that he presented a new city with its future shape and patterns evident from the beginning. This meant that the original plan included paving streets that were not immediately put into use; the advantage of this was that the original plan is hard to undo because he provided for an entire street network, but on the other hand, is difficult to adapt and mold to other circumstances in the future.[15] In addition, there has been controversy with the monumental aspect of Lúcio Costa's Plan, because it appeared to some as 19th century city planning, not modern 20th century in urbanism.[20]\n\n\nAn interesting analysis can be made of Brasilia within the context of Cold War politics and the association of Lúcio Costa's plan to the symbolism of aviation. From an architectural perspective, the airplane-shaped plan was certainly an homage to Le Corbusier and his enchantment with the aircraft as an architectural masterpiece. However, Brasilia was constructed soon after the end of World War II. Despite Brazil's minor participation in the conflict, the airplane shape of the city was key in envisioning the country as part of the newly globalized world, together with the victorious Allies.[21] Furthermore, Brasilia is a unique example of modernism both as a guideline for architectural design but also as a principle for organizing society. Modernism in Brasilia is explored in James Holston's book, *The Modernist City*.[22]\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nJuscelino Kubitschek, president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, ordered Brasilia's construction, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasilia was part of Juscelino's \"fifty years of prosperity in five\" plan. Already in 1892, the astronomer Louis Cruls, in the service of the Brazilian government, had investigated the site for the future capital. Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner[23] in 1957, with 5550 people competing. Oscar Niemeyer was the chief architect of most public buildings, Joaquim Cardozo was the structural engineer, and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer. Brasilia was built in 41 months, from 1956 to 21 April 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAerial view of downtown Brasília (Pilot Plan) along the Monumental Axis, especially the new Mane Garrincha Stadium (left), the National Congress and the Three Powers Plaza (right).

Paranoá Lake, a large artificial lake, was built to increase the amount of water available and to maintain the region's humidity. It has a marina, and hosts wakeboarders and windsurfers. Diving can also be practiced and one of the main attractions is Vila Amaury, an old village submerged in the lake. This is where the first construction workers of Brasilia used to live.[24]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nBrasilia has a tropical savanna climate (*Aw*, according to the Köppen climate classification), milder due to the elevation and with two distinct seasons: the rainy season, from October to April, and the dry season, from May to September.[25] The average temperature is 21.4 °C (70.5 °F).[26] September, at the end of the dry season, has the highest average maximum temperature, 29.1 °C (84.4 °F), and July has major and minor lower maximum average temperature, of 25.6 °C (78.1 °F) and 13.9 °C (57.0 °F), respectively.[27][28] Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22 °C (72 °F).[26] With 253.1 mm (10.0 in), November is the month with the highest rainfall of the year, while July is the lowest, with only 1.5 mm (0.1 in).[29] During the dry season, the city can have very low relative humidity levels, often below 30%.[30]\n\n\nAccording to the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), the record low temperature was 1.6 °C (34.9 °F) on 18 July 1975, and the record high was 36.4 °C (97.5 °F) on 18 October 2015[31] and 8 October 2020.[32][33] The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was 132.8 mm (5.2 in) on 15 November 1963.[34]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Brasília (1991–2020, extremes 1961–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 35.7(96.3)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 34.5(94.1)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.8(71.2)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 206.0(8.11)\n | 179.5(7.07)\n | 226.0(8.90)\n | 145.2(5.72)\n | 26.9(1.06)\n | 3.3(0.13)\n | 1.5(0.06)\n | 16.3(0.64)\n | 38.1(1.50)\n | 141.8(5.58)\n | 253.1(9.96)\n | 241.1(9.49)\n | 1,478.8(58.22)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 16\n | 14\n | 15\n | 9\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 10\n | 17\n | 18\n | 109\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.7\n | 74.2\n | 76.1\n | 72.2\n | 65.4\n | 58.8\n | 51.0\n | 43.5\n | 46.4\n | 58.8\n | 74.5\n | 76.0\n | 64.3\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 159.6\n | 158.9\n | 168.7\n | 200.8\n | 237.9\n | 247.6\n | 268.3\n | 273.5\n | 225.7\n | 191.3\n | 138.3\n | 145.0\n | 2,415.6\n |\n| Source 1: Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia[27][26][28][29][35][36][37] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[38] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of Brazil, and Immigration to Brazil\n\n![](image)Brasilia at night from ISS\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n| Race and ethnicity in Brasília |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 48.2% |\n| White |  | 42.2% |\n| Black |  | 7.7% |\n| Asian |  | 1.6% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.2% |\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, 2,469,489 people resided in Brasilia and its metropolitan area,[39] of whom 1,239,882 were Pardo (Multiracial) (48.2%), 1,084,418 White (42.2%), 198,072 Black (7.7%), 41,522 Asian (1.6%), and 6,128 Amerindian (0.2%).[40]\n\n\nIn 2010, Brasilia was ranked the fourth-most populous city in Brazil after São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador.[41] In 2010, the city had 474,871 opposite-sex couples and 1,241 same-sex couples. The population of Brasilia was 52.2% female and 47.8% male.[40]\n\n\nIn the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal district. By 1970 this figure had grown to 537,000. By 2010 the population of the Federal District had surpassed 2,5 million. The city of Brasilia proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529,[42] but its metropolitan area within the Federal District has grown past this figure.[43]\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the growth of Brasilia was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasilia would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasilia, seeking public and private employment.[44]\n\n\nAt the close of the 20th century, Brasilia was the largest city in the world which had not existed at the beginning of the century.[45] Brasilia has one of the highest population growth rates in Brazil, with annual growth of 2.82%, mostly due to internal migration.\n\n\nBrasilia's inhabitants include a foreign population of mostly embassy workers as well as large numbers of Brazilian internal migrants. Today, the city has important communities of immigrants and refugees. The city's Human Development Index was 0.936 in 2000 (developed level), and the city's literacy rate was around 95.65%.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of Brasilia\nChristianity is by far the most prevalent religion in Brasília, with Roman Catholicism being the largest denomination.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Religion\n | Percentage\n | Number\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Catholic | 56.62%\n | 1,455,134\n |\n| Protestant | 26.88%\n | 690,982\n |\n| No religion | 9.20%\n | 236,528\n |\n| Other\n | 3.72%\n | 95,605\n |\n| Spiritist | 3.50%\n | 89,836\n |\n| Jewish | 0.04%\n | 1,103\n |\n| Muslim | 0.04%\n | 972\n |\n| Total\n | 100.00%\n | 2,570,160\n |\n\n\n*Source: IBGE 2010.[46]* \n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Constitution of Brazil\n\n![](image)Palácio Buriti, seat of government of the Federal District\nBrasília does not have a mayor or councillors, because article 32 of the Constitution of Brazil expressly prohibits the Federal District being divided into municipalities.\n\n\nThe Federal District is a legal entity of internal public law, which is part of the political-administrative structure of Brazil of a *sui generis* nature, because it is neither a state nor a municipality, but rather a special entity that incorporates the legislative powers reserved to the states and municipalities, as provided in Article 32, § 1º of the Constitution, which gives it a hybrid nature, both state and municipal.[47]\n\n\nThe executive power of the Federal District was represented by the mayor of the Federal District until 1969, when the position was transformed into governor of the Federal District.[48][49]\n\n\nThe legislative power of the Federal District is represented by the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District, whose nomenclature includes a mixture of legislative assembly (legislative power of the other units of the federation) and of municipal chamber (legislative of the municipalities). The Legislative Chamber is made up of 24 district deputies.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Legislative Chamber of the Federal District building\nThe judicial power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories as it is constituted, but Brazil does not have any territories.

In 2012, the fund totaled 9.6 billion reais.[51] By 2015, the forecast is 12.4 billion reais, of which more than half (6.4 billion) is spent on public security spending.[52]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nBrasilia is twinned with:[53]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) **Abuja**, Nigeria[53]\n* ![](image) **Asunción**, Paraguay[53]\n* ![](image) **Brussels**, Belgium[53]\n* ![](image) **Buenos Aires**, Argentina *(since 2002)*[53]\n* ![](image) **Gaza City**, Palestine[53]\n* ![](image) **Havana**, Cuba[53]\n* ![](image) **Khartoum**, Sudan[53]\n* ![](image) **Lisbon**, Portugal[54]\n* ![](image) **Luxor**, Egypt[53]\n* ![](image) **Montevideo**, Uruguay[53]\n* ![](image) **Pretoria**, South Africa[53]\n* ![](image) **Santiago**, Chile[53]\n* ![](image) **Tehran**, Iran[53]\n* ![](image) **Vienna**, Austria[53]\n* ![](image) **Washington, D.C.**, United States *(since 2013)*[55]\n* ![](image) **Xi'an**, China *(since 1997)*[53]\n* ![](image) **Guadalajara**, Mexico.[56]\n\nOf these, Abuja and Washington, D.C. were also cities specifically planned as the seat of government of their respective countries.\n\n\n\nBrasília Declarations\nBrasília is associated with several significant declarations in the international political and social field, including:\n\n\n\n* The Brasília Declaration of the IBSA Dialogue Forum (2003), signed by the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA) regarding representation at the United Nations Security Council\n* Brasília Declaration on the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons in the Americas (2010)[57]\n* Brasília Declaration on Child Labour (2013), issued by the Third Global Conference on Child Labour – hosted in Brasília by the Brazilian Government[58]\n* Brasília Declaration of Judges on Water Justice (2018), adopted in 2018 during the Conference of Judges and Prosecutors on Water Justice at the 8th World Water Forum, described as \"a landmark in [the] development of water justice jurisprudence\"[59]\n* The 15th Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas, meeting in Brasília in 2022, issued a Declaration condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[60]\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Brazil\n\n![](image)South Banking Sector\n![](image)South Hotel Sector\n![](image)Brasília products treemap, 2020\nThe major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Brasilia's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center.\n\n\nIndustries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software. The gross domestic product (GDP) is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.[61]\n\n\nBesides being the political center, Brasilia is an important economic center. In 2018, it has the third highest GDP of cities in Brazil, R$254 billion reais,[62] representing 3.6% of the total Brazilian GDP. Most economic activity in the federal capital results from its administrative function.\n\n\nIts industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District. Being a city registered by UNESCO,[63] the government in Brasilia has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software, film, video, and gemology among others, with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance, preserving the city property.\n\n\nAccording to Mercer's city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, Brasilia ranks 45th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2012, up from the 70th position in 2010, ranking behind São Paulo (12th) and Rio de Janeiro (13th).\n\n\n\n### Industries[edit]\n\n\nIndustries in the city include construction (Paulo Octavio, Via Construções, and Irmãos Gravia among others); food processing (Perdigão, Sadia); furniture making; recycling (Novo Rio, Rexam, Latasa and others); pharmaceuticals (União Química); and graphic industries. The main agricultural products produced in the city are coffee, guavas, strawberries, oranges, lemons, papayas, soybeans, and mangoes. It has over 110,000 cows and it exports wood products worldwide.\n\n\nThe Federal District, where Brasilia is located, has a GDP of R$133,4 billion (about US$64.1 billion), about the same as Belarus according to The Economist. Its share of the total Brazilian GDP is about 3.8%.[64] The Federal District has the largest GDP per capita income of Brazil US$25,062, slightly higher than Belarus.[64]\n\n\nThe city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including accommodation, Hotels Sectors North and South. New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere, such as the hotels and tourism Sector North, located on the shores of Lake Paranoá.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of Brazil\n\n![](image)Cultural Complex of the Republic\nAs a venue for political events, music performances and movie festivals, Brasilia is a cosmopolitan city, with around 124 embassies, a wide range of restaurants and a complete infrastructure ready to host any kind of event. Not surprisingly, the city stands out as an important business/tourism destination, which is an important part of the local economy, with dozens of hotels spread around the federal capital. Traditional parties take place throughout the year.\n\n\nIn June, large festivals known as \"festas juninas\" are held celebrating Catholic saints such as Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Peter. On 7 September, the traditional Independence Day parade is held on the Ministries Esplanade. Throughout the year, local, national, and international events are held throughout the city. Christmas is widely celebrated, and New Year's Eve usually hosts major events celebrated in the city.[65]\n\n\nThe city also hosts a varied assortment of art works from artists like Bruno Giorgi, Alfredo Ceschiatti, Athos Bulcão, Marianne Peretti, Alfredo Volpi, Di Cavalcanti, Dyllan Taxman, Victor Brecheret and Burle Marx, whose works have been integrated into the city's architecture, making it a unique landscape. The cuisine in the city is very diverse. Many of the best restaurants in the city can be found in the Asa Sul district.[66]\n\n\nThe city is the birthplace of Brazilian rock and place of origin of bands like: Legião Urbana, Capital Inicial, Aborto Elétrico, Plebe Rude and Raimundos. Brasilia has the Rock Basement Festival which brings new bands to the national scene. The festival is held in the parking Brasilia National Stadium Mané Garrincha.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cláudio Santoro National Theater\nSince 1965, the annual Brasilia Festival of Brazilian Cinema is one of the most traditional cinema festivals in Brazil, being compared only to the Brazilian Cinema Festival of Gramado, in Rio Grande do Sul. The difference between both is that the festival in Brasilia still preserves the tradition to only submit and reward Brazilian movies.\n\n\nThe International Dance Seminar in Brasilia has brought top-notch dance to the Federal Capital since 1991. International teachers, shows with choreographers and guest groups and scholarships abroad are some of the hallmarks of the event. The Seminar is the central axis of the DANCE BRAZIL program and is promoted by the DF State Department of Culture in partnership with the Cultural Association Claudio Santoro. [1]\n\n\nBrasilia has also been the focus of modern-day literature. Published in 2008, *The World In Grey: Dom Bosco's Prophecy*, by author Ryan J. Lucero, tells an apocalyptical story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco.[67] According to Don Bosco's prophecy:[68] \"Between parallels 15 and 20, around a lake which shall be formed; A great civilization will thrive, and that will be the Promised Land\". Brasilia lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S, where an artificial lake (Paranoá Lake) was formed. Don Bosco is Brasilia's patron saint.\n\n\n*American Flagg!*, the First Comics comic book series created by Howard Chaykin, portrays Brasilia as a cosmopolitan world capital of culture and exotic romance. In the series, it is a top vacation and party destination. The 2015 Rede Globo series *Felizes para Sempre?* was set in Brasilia.[69]\n\n\n\n### Architecture and urbanism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brazilian Flag and the National Congress in spring\nAt the Square of Three Powers, Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and Brazilian structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo made buildings in the style of modern Brazilian architecture.[70] The Congress also occupies various other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels.\n\n\nThe National Congress building is located in the middle of the Eixo Monumental, the city's main avenue. In front lies a large lawn and reflecting pool. The building faces the Praça dos Três Poderes where the Palácio do Planalto and the Supreme Federal Court are located. The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings. In residential areas, buildings were built that were inspired in French modernist and bauhaus design.[71]\n\n\nAlthough not fully accomplished, the \"Brasilia utopia\" has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the **superquadras**) surrounded by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafés; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit.[72] Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname \"ilha da fantasia\" (\"fantasy island\"), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the states of Goiás and Minas Gerais, around Brasilia.[72]\n\n\nCritics of Brasilia's grand scale have characterized it as a modernist bauhaus platonic fantasy about the future:\n\n\n\n![](image)The Monumental Axis\n![](image)Aerial view of South Wing (*Asa Sul*) district\n![](image)Monumental Axis and Brasilia TV Tower\n\n> Nothing dates faster than people's fantasies about the future. This is what you get when perfectly decent, intelligent, and talented men start thinking in terms of space rather than place; and single rather than multiple meanings. It's what you get when you design for political aspirations rather than real human needs. You get miles of jerry-built platonic nowhere infested with Volkswagens. This, one may fervently hope, is the last experiment of its kind. The utopian buck stops here.\n> \n> — Robert Hughes, *The Shock of the New*, Episode 4: \"Trouble in Utopia\", (1980)\n> \n\n\n#### Notable structures[edit]\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Brasilia in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is an expression of the atheist architect Oscar Niemeyer and the structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo. This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure, seems with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens.\n\n\nThe cathedral's structure was finished on 31 May 1970, and only the 70 m (229.66 ft) diameter of the circular area were visible. Niemeyer's and Cardozo's project of Cathedral of Brasilia is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. There is controversy as to what these columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent, some say they are two hands moving upwards to heaven, others associate it to the chalice Jesus used in the last supper and some claim it represent his crown of thorns. The cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970.\n\n\nAt the end of the *Eixo Monumental* (\"Monumental Axis\") lies the *Esplanada dos Ministérios* (\"Ministries Esplanade\"),[73] an open area in downtown Brasilia. The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many government buildings, monuments and memorials are located. On Sundays and holidays, the Eixo Monumental is closed to cars so that locals may use it as a place to walk, bike, and have picnics under the trees.\n\n\n*Praça dos Três Poderes* (Portuguese for *Square of the Three Powers*) is a plaza in Brasilia. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the Executive, represented by the Palácio do Planalto (presidential office); the Legislative, represented by the National Congress (Congresso Nacional); and the Judiciary branch, represented by the Supreme Federal Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal). It is a tourist attraction in Brasilia, designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.\n\n\n\n![](image)Praça dos Três Poderes (Three Powers Plaza)\n![](image)The Palácio da Alvorada\nThe Palácio da Alvorada is the official residence of the president of Brazil. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasilia, by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958. One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the \"Alvorada\" lies on a peninsula at the shore of Lake Paranoá.\n\n\nThe principles of simplicity and modernity that in the past characterized the great works of architecture motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landing on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor.\n\n\nThe auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.\n\n\nThe Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the president of Brazil. It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasilia. As the seat of government, the term \"Planalto\" is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto.\n\n\nThe President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the Palácio da Alvorada. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the \"Planalto\", including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff. The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios. The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer, creator of most of the important buildings in Brasilia. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000 m2. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the University of Brasilia\nSee also: Education in Brazil\n\nThe city has six international schools: American School of Brasilia, Brasilia International School (BIS), Escola das Nações, Swiss International School (SIS), Lycée français François-Mitterrand (LfFM) and Maple Bear Canadian School.[74] August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school – the British School of Brasilia. Brasilia has two universities, three university centers, and many private colleges.\n\n\nThe main tertiary educational institutions are: Universidade de Brasilia – University of Brasilia (UnB) (public); Universidade Católica de Brasilia – Catholic University of Brasilia (UCB); Centro Universitário de Brasilia (UniCEUB); Centro Universitário Euroamaricano (Unieuro); Centro Universitário do Distrito Federal [pt] (UDF); Universidade Paulista [pt] (UNIP); and Instituto de Educação Superior de Brasilia (IESB).\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe average commute time on public transit in Brasilia, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 96 min. 31% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 28 min, while 61% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 15.1 km (9.4 mi), while 50% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.[75]\n\n\n\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brasília International Airport\n\n![](image)Brasilia International Airport (BSB)\n![](image)Aerial view of the airport\nBrasilia–Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights. It is the third busiest Brazilian airport based on passengers and aircraft movements.[76] Because of its strategic location it is a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This results in a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in a holding pattern before landing. Following the airport's master plan, Infraero built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. In 2007, the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers.[76] The main building's third floor, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theaters with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. Brasilia Airport has 136 vendor spaces. The airport is located about 11 km (6.8 mi) from the central area of Brasilia, outside the metro system. The area outside the airport's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services that connect the airport to Brasilia's central district. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars.[77]\n\n\nThe airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca), in addition to a number of international carriers. In 2012, Brasilia's International Airport was won by the InfraAmerica consortium, formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company, with a 50% stake each.[78] During the 25-year concession, the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year.[79]\n\n\nIn 2014 the airport received 15 new boarding bridges, totaling 28 in all. This was the main requirement made by the federal government, which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction. The group invested R$750 million in the project. In the same year, the number of parking spaces doubled, reaching three thousand. The airport's entrance has a new rooftop cover and a new access road. Furthermore, a VIP room was created on Terminal 1's third floor. The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasilia's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014.[80] Brasília Air Force Base - ALA1, one of their most important bases of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in Brasília.\n\n\n\n### Road transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge\nLike most Brazilian cities, Brasilia has a good network of taxi companies. Taxis from the airport are available outside the terminal, but at times there can be quite a queue of people. Although the airport is not far from the downtown area, taxi prices do seem to be higher than in other Brazilian cities. Booking in advance can be advantageous, particularly if time is limited, and local companies should be able to assist airport transfer or transport requirements.\n\n\nThe Juscelino Kubitschek bridge, also known as the 'President JK Bridge' or the 'JK Bridge', crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasilia. It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek, former president of Brazil. It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde. Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal[81] for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to \"...outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment, aesthetic merit and successful community participation\". It consists of three 60 m (200 ft) tall asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally. With a length of 1,200 m (0.75 miles), it was completed in 2002 at a cost of US$56.8 million. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to bicyclists and skaters.\n\n\n\n![](image)Central Bus Station\nThe main bus hub in Brasilia is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the Eixo Monumental and the Eixão, about 2 km (1.2 mi) from the Three Powers Plaza. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasilia. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasilia and others connecting Brasilia to the satellite cities. In the original city plan, the interstate buses would also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasilia (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferroviária) located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station. A new bus station was opened in July 2010. It is on Saída Sul (South Exit) near Parkshopping Mall with its metro station, and is also an inter-state bus station, used only to leave the Federal District.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Federal District Metro\nThere is no passenger rail service in Brasilia, but the Expresso Pequi rail line is planned to link Brasilia and Goiânia. A 22 km light rail line is planned, estimated to cost between 1 billion reais (US$258 million) and 1.5 billion reais with capacity to transport around 200,000 passengers per day.[82]\n\n\nThe Federal District Metro is Federal District's underground metro system. The system has 24 stations on two lines, the Orange and Green lines, along a total network of 43 km (27 mi), covering some of the Federal District. Both lines begin at the Central Station and run parallel until the Águas Claras Station. The Federal District Metro is not comprehensive so buses may provide better access to the center. The metro leaves the Rodoviária (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities, such as Samambaia, Taguatinga and Ceilândia, as well as Guará and Águas Claras. The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself (the census of 2000 indicated that Ceilândia had 344,039 inhabitants, Taguatinga had 243,575, and the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants), and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation.[83]\n\n\nA high-speed railway was planned between Brasilia and Goiânia, the capital of the state of Goias, but it will probably be turned into a regional service linking the capital cities and cities in between, like Anápolis and Alexânia.[84]\n\n\n\n## Sport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Estádio Nacional de Brasilia\nThe main stadiums are the Brasilia National Stadium Mané Garrincha (which was re-inaugurated on 18 May 2013), the Serejão Stadium (home for Brasiliense) and the Bezerrão Stadium (home for Gama).\n\n\nBrasilia was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, for which Brazil is the host nation. Brasilia hosted the opening of the Confederations Cup and hosted 7 World Cup games.[85] Brasilia also hosted the football tournaments during the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n![](image)Nilson Nelson Gymnasium\nBrasilia is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports, sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings. Practitioners of such sports reveal that, because of the city's dry weather, the city offers strong thermal winds and great \"cloud-streets\", which is also the name for a maneuver quite appreciated by practitioners. In 2003, Brasilia hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship, one of the categories of free flying. In August 2005, the city hosted the second stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship.\n\n\nBrasilia is the site of the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet which hosted a non-championship round of the 1974 Formula One Grand Prix season. An IndyCar race was cancelled at the last minute in 2015. The track, which has been closed since 2015, is being renovated for the end of 2023.\n\n\nThe city is also home to Uniceub BRB, one of Brazil's best basketball clubs, who became NBB champion in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The club hosts some of its games at the 16,000 all-seat Nilson Nelson Gymnasium.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Brazil portal\n* ![map](image)Latin America portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* List of purpose-built national capitals\n\n\n**Purpose-built Brazilian state capitals**\n\n\n\n* Aracaju\n* Belo Horizonte\n* Boa Vista\n* Palmas\n* Teresina\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The administrative region of Brasília recorded a population of 214,529 in a 2012 survey; IBGE demographic publications do not make this distinction and considers the entire population of the Federal District.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** IBGE: Brasília Archived 17 October 2013 at the Wayback Machine IBGE.

The Brazilian architect and planner Lúcio Costa's entry for the design competition for the new city in 1956 was a series of sketches of ideal urban forms of communal apartment blocks loosely based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and 'superblocks' of single-family houses based on the North American Radburn layout (1929). He subsequently elaborated these into the Plano Piloto (Pilot Plan), and added the satellite city of Taguatinga.\n18. **^** Peter William Kellett; Felipe Hernández; Lea Knudsen Allen, eds.

Since the 19th century,[11] the name \"London\" also refers to the metropolis around this core, historically split among the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London,[13] which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.[note 3][14]\n\n\nAs one of the world's major global cities,[15] London exerts a strong influence on world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, transport, and communications.[16][17] Its GDP of €801.66 billion in 2017 makes it the largest urban economy in Europe,[18] and it is one of the major financial centres in the world. With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions,[19] it is home to some of the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world—Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London.[20][21] London is the most visited city in Europe and has the busiest city airport system in the world.[22] The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.[23]\n\n\nLondon's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages.[24] The 2023 population of Greater London of just under 10 million[25] made it Europe's third-most populous city,[26] accounting for 13.4% of the population of the United Kingdom[27] and over 16% of the population of England. The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, with about 9.8 million inhabitants at the 2011 census.[28][29] The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, with about 14 million inhabitants in 2016,[note 4][30][31] granting London the status of a megacity.\n\n\nLondon has four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the combined Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and also the historic settlement in Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, defines the prime meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time.[32] Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. London has many museums, galleries, libraries, and cultural venues, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library, and numerous West End theatres.[33] Important sporting events held in London include the FA Cup Final, the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, and the London Marathon. In 2012, London became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games.[34]\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Etymology of London\n\n*London* is an ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form *Londinium*.[35] Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually *Londinium*), Old English (usually *Lunden*), and Welsh (usually *Llundein*), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as \\**Londonjon* or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as *Londinium* and borrowed into Old English.[36]\n\n\nUntil 1889, the name \"London\" applied officially only to the City of London, but since then it has also referred to the County of London and to Greater London.[37]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of London\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of London.\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream from Vauxhall Bridge.[38] Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BC.[38] In 2010, foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BC,[39] were found on the Thames's south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge.[40] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames.[40]\n\n\n\n### Roman London[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Londinium\n\n![](image)Reconstruction drawing of Londinium in 120 AD\nDespite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans around 47 AD,[2] about four years after their invasion of 43 AD.[41] This only lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the ground.[42]\n\n\nThe next planned incarnation of Londinium prospered, superseding Colchester as the principal city of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of about 60,000.[43]\n\n\n\n### Anglo-Saxon and Viking-period London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally.\nWith the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about 450.[44] From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city.[45] By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.[46]\n\n\nThe Vikings applied Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England, its boundary running roughly from London to Chester as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* records that Alfred \"refounded\" London in 886. Archaeological research shows this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about 950.[47]\n\n\nBy the 11th century, London was clearly the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: \"It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Westminster Abbey, as seen in this painting (by Canaletto, 1749), is a World Heritage Site and one of London's oldest and most important buildings.\nAfter winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.[49] William built the Tower of London, the first of many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south-eastern corner of the city, to intimidate the inhabitants.[50] In 1097, William II began building Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. It became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.[51]\n\n\nIn the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto followed the royal English court around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed, for most purposes at Westminster, although the royal treasury came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true governmental capital, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was some 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.[52] With the Black Death in the mid-14th century, London lost nearly a third of its population.[53] London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.[54]\n\n\nLondon was a centre of England's Jewish population before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290. Violence against Jews occurred in 1190, when it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation.[55] In 1264 during the Second Barons' War, Simon de Montfort's rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.[56]\n\n\n\n### Early modern[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of London in 1593. There is only one bridge across the Thames, but parts of Southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed.\nDuring the Tudor period, the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism. Much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.[57] In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up a main trading base (*kontor*) of England in London, called the *Stalhof* or *Steelyard*. It remained until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway.[58] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries.[59]\n\n\nYet English maritime enterprise hardly reached beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean was normally through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. The reopening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 spurred a burst of commercial activity.[60] The Royal Exchange was founded.[61] Mercantilism grew and monopoly traders such as the East India Company were founded as trade expanded to the New World. London became the main North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from about 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.[57]\n\n\nIn the 16th century, William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London during English Renaissance theatre. Shakespeare's Globe Theatre was constructed in 1599 in Southwark. Stage performances came to a halt in London when Puritan authorities shut down the theatres in the 1640s and 1650s.[62] The ban on theatre was lifted during the Restoration in 1660, and London's oldest operating theatre, Drury Lane, opened in 1663 in what is now the West End theatre district.[63]\n\n\nBy the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot of 5 November 1605.[64] In 1637, the government of Charles I attempted to reform administration in the London area. This called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the Liberties of London, coupled with a lack of interest in administering these additional areas or concern by city guilds of having to share power, caused the Corporation's \"The Great Refusal\", a decision which largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the City.[65]\n\n\nIn the English Civil War, the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.[66]\nThe fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647,[67] and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666.\nLondon was plagued by disease in the early 17th century,[69] culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.[69]\n\n\nThe Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[70] Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by polymath Robert Hooke.[71] In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral, was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 18th century.[72]\n\n\nIn 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House, which was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was said to be dogged by crime,[73] and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force.[74] Epidemics during the 1720s and 30s saw most children born in the city die before reaching their fifth birthday.[75]\n\n\nCoffee-houses became a popular place to debate ideas, as growing literacy and development of the printing press made news widely available, with Fleet Street becoming the centre of the British press. The invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies led many financiers to relocate to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world's leading war fleet, acting as a major deterrent to potential economic adversaries. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.[76]\n\n\n\n### Late modern and contemporary[edit]\n\n\nWith the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, an unprecedented growth in urbanisation took place, and the number of High Streets (the primary street for retail in Britain) rapidly grew.[77][78] London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925, with a population density of 802 per acre (325 per hectare).[79] In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods, such as Harding, Howell & Co.—one of the first department stores—located on Pall Mall, the streets had scores of street sellers.[77] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[80] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital.[81]\n\n\nFrom the early years of the 20th century onwards, teashops were found on High Streets across London and the rest of Britain, with Lyons, who opened the first of their chain of teashops in Piccadilly in 1894, leading the way.[82] The tearooms, such as the Criterion in Piccadilly, became a popular meeting place for women from the suffrage movement.[83] The city was the target of many attacks during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, between 1912 and 1914, which saw historic landmarks such as Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral bombed.[84]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBritish volunteer recruits in London, August 1914, during World War I\n![](image)\nA bombed-out London street during the Blitz, World War II\n\nLondon was bombed by the Germans in the First World War, and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German *Luftwaffe* killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city.[85] The tomb of the Unknown Warrior, an unidentified member of the British armed forces killed during the First World War, was buried in Westminster Abbey on 11 November 1920.[86] The Cenotaph, located in Whitehall, was unveiled on the same day, and is the focal point for the National Service of Remembrance held annually on Remembrance Sunday, the closest Sunday to 11 November.[87]\n\n\nThe 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, while London was still recovering from the war.[88] From the 1940s, London became home to many immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan,[89] making London one of the most diverse cities in the world. In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank.[90] The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the \"pea soup fogs\" for which London had been notorious, and had earned it the nickname the \"Big Smoke\".[91]\n\n\nStarting mainly in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London sub-culture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street.[92] The role of trendsetter revived in the punk era.[93] In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded in response to the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created.[94] During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was hit from 1973 by bomb attacks by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.[95] These attacks lasted for two decades, starting with the Old Bailey bombing.[95] Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.[96]\n\n\nGreater London's population declined in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s.[97] The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was born out of London's increasing role as an international financial centre in the 1980s.[98] Located about 2 miles (3.2 km) east of central London, the Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.[99]\n\n\nThe Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, leaving London with no central administration until 2000 and the creation of the Greater London Authority.[100] To mark the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed.[101] On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, as the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times.[34] On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.[95]\n\n\nIn 2008, *Time* named London alongside New York City and Hong Kong as Nylonkong, hailing them as the world's three most influential global cities.[102] In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, its highest since 1939.[103] During the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but most London constituencies voted for remaining.[104] However, Britain's exit from the EU in early 2021 only marginally weakened London's position as an international financial centre.[105]\n\n\nOn 6 May 2023, the coronation of Charles III and his wife, Camilla, as king and queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, took place at Westminster Abbey, London.[106]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\n### Local government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Local government in London, History of local government in London, and List of heads of London government\n\n![](image)Arms of the Corporation of the City of London[107]\nThe administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.[108] The GLA consists of two elected components: the mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year. The GLA has responsibility for the majority of London's transport system through its functional arm Transport for London (TfL), it is responsible for overseeing the city's police and fire services, and also for setting a strategic vision for London on a range of issues.[109] The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Newham. The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital.[110] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.[111]\n\n\nThe local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation.[112] They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, libraries, leisure and recreation, social services, local roads and refuse collection.[113] Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).[114]\n\n\nThe London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London, run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. It is the third largest fire service in the world.[115] National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world.[116] The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames, which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.[117]\n\n\n\n### National government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)10 Downing Street, official residence of the Prime Minister\nLondon is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many government departments, as well as the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall.[118] There are 73 members of Parliament (MPs) from London; As of December 2019[update], 49 are from the Labour Party, 21 are Conservatives, and three are Liberal Democrats.[119] The ministerial post of minister for London was created in 1994 and as of 2020 is held by Paul Scully.[120]\n\n\n\n### Policing and crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in London\n\nPolicing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police (\"The Met\"), overseen by the mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).[121] The Met is also referred to as Scotland Yard after the location of its original headquarters in a road called Great Scotland Yard in Whitehall. The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police.[122] First worn by Met police officers in 1863, the custodian helmet has been called a \"cultural icon\" and a \"symbol of British law enforcement\".[123] Introduced by the Met in 1929, the blue police telephone box (basis for the TARDIS in *Doctor Who*) was once a common sight throughout London and regional cities in the UK.[124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters of MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence service, at the SIS Building. Scenes featuring James Bond (the fictional MI6 agent) have been filmed here.\nThe British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services.[125]\nThe Ministry of Defence Police is a special police force in London, which does not generally become involved with policing the general public.[126] The UK's domestic counter-intelligence service (MI5) is headquartered in Thames House on the north bank of the River Thames, and the foreign intelligence service (MI6) is headquartered in the SIS Building on the south bank.[127]\n\n\nCrime rates vary widely across different areas of London. Crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level.[128] In 2015, there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014.[129]\nRecorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018. Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are involved.[130] However, the murder rate in London is much lower than other major cities around the world.[131]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of London\n\n### Scope[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of London in June 2018\nLondon, also known as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis. The City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing \"London\" to be defined several ways.[132]\n\n\nForty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, in which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.[133] The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some just outside included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.[134]\n\n\nFurther urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt, although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, producing a separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt.[135] Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London,[136] and by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central London area. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about 51°30′26″N 00°07′39″W﻿ / ﻿51.50722°N 0.12750°W﻿ / 51.50722; -0.12750.[137]\n\n\n\n### Status[edit]\n\n\nWithin London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies.[138] The area of Greater London includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire.[139] London's status as the capital of England, and later the United Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed by statute or in written form.[note 5]\n\n\nIts status as a capital was established by constitutional convention, which means its status as *de facto* capital is a part of the UK's uncodified constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation.[142] More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as *London*.[143]\n\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)London from Primrose Hill\nGreater London encompasses a total area of 611 square miles (1,583 km2) an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 11,760 inhabitants per square mile (4,542/km2). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 3,236 square miles (8,382 km2) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 3,900 inhabitants per square mile (1,510/km2).[144]\n\n\nModern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a flood plain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically London grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.[145]\n\n\nSince the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.[146] The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level caused by climate change and by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles as a result of post-glacial rebound.[147]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of London\n\n\n\n| London, England\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 59\n\n\n\n8\n\n3\n | 45\n\n\n\n9\n\n3\n | 39\n\n\n\n12\n\n4\n | 42\n\n\n\n15\n\n6\n | 46\n\n\n\n18\n\n9\n | 47\n\n\n\n22\n\n12\n | 46\n\n\n\n24\n\n14\n | 53\n\n\n\n23\n\n14\n | 50\n\n\n\n20\n\n12\n | 65\n\n\n\n16\n\n9\n | 67\n\n\n\n11\n\n5\n | 57\n\n\n\n9\n\n3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 2.3\n\n\n\n47\n\n37\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n48\n\n37\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n53\n\n39\n | 1.7\n\n\n\n59\n\n43\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n65\n\n48\n | 1.9\n\n\n\n71\n\n54\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n75\n\n58\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n57\n | 2\n\n\n\n68\n\n53\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n60\n\n48\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n53\n\n41\n | 2.2\n\n\n\n48\n\n38\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nLondon has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: *Cfb*). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is 7.4 inches (189 mm) in November 1755 and the least is 0 inches (0 mm) in both December 1788 and July 1800. Mile End also had 0 inches (0 mm) in April 1893.[148] The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of 38.1 inches (969 mm) and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of 12.1 inches (308 mm).[149] The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600 mm, which is half the annual rainfall of New York City.[150] Despite its relatively low annual precipitation, London still receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0 mm threshold annually. However, London is vulnerable to climate change in the United Kingdom, and there is increasing concern among hydrological experts that London households may run out of water before 2050.[151]\n\n\nTemperature extremes in London range from 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) at Heathrow on 19 July 2022 down to −17.4 °C (0.7 °F) at Northolt on 13 December 1981.[152][153] Records for atmospheric pressure have been kept at London since 1692. The highest pressure ever reported is 1,049.8 millibars (31.00 inHg) on 20 January 2020.[154]\n\n\nSummers are generally warm, sometimes hot. London's average July high is 23.5 °C (74.3 °F). On average each year, London experiences 31 days above 25 °C (77.0 °F) and 4.2 days above 30.0 °C (86.0 °F). During the 2003 European heat wave, prolonged heat led to hundreds of heat-related deaths.[155] A previous spell of 15 consecutive days above 32.2 °C (90.0 °F) in England in 1976 also caused many heat related deaths.[156] A previous temperature of 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) in August 1911 at the Greenwich station was later disregarded as non-standard.[157] Droughts can also, occasionally, be a problem, especially in summer, most recently in summer 2018, and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December.[158] However, the most consecutive days without rain was 73 days in the spring of 1893.[159]\n\n\nWinters are generally cool with little temperature variation. Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter. Spring and autumn can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect,[160] making the centre of London at times 5 °C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts.[161]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for London (LHR),[note 6] elevation: 25 m (82 ft), 1991–2020 normals\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 40.2(104.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 35.0(95.0)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n | 40.2(104.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 7.9(46.2)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 19.0(66.2)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.7(36.9)\n | 2.7(36.9)\n | 4.1(39.4)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 5.3(41.5)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −16.1(3.0)\n | −13.9(7.0)\n | −8.9(16.0)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −0.6(30.9)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 1.4(34.5)\n | −5.5(22.1)\n | −7.1(19.2)\n | −17.4(0.7)\n | −17.4(0.7)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 58.8(2.31)\n | 45.0(1.77)\n | 38.8(1.53)\n | 42.3(1.67)\n | 45.9(1.81)\n | 47.3(1.86)\n | 45.8(1.80)\n | 52.8(2.08)\n | 49.6(1.95)\n | 65.1(2.56)\n | 66.6(2.62)\n | 57.1(2.25)\n | 615.0(24.21)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 11.5\n | 9.5\n | 8.5\n | 8.8\n | 8.0\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.4\n | 7.9\n | 10.8\n | 11.2\n | 10.8\n | 111.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 80\n | 77\n | 70\n | 65\n | 67\n | 65\n | 65\n | 69\n | 73\n | 78\n | 81\n | 81\n | 73\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 3(37)\n | 2(36)\n | 2(36)\n | 4(39)\n | 7(45)\n | 10(50)\n | 12(54)\n | 12(54)\n | 10(50)\n | 9(48)\n | 6(43)\n | 3(37)\n | 7(44)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 61.1\n | 78.8\n | 124.5\n | 176.7\n | 207.5\n | 208.4\n | 217.8\n | 202.1\n | 157.1\n | 115.2\n | 70.7\n | 55.0\n | 1,674.8\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 23\n | 28\n | 31\n | 40\n | 41\n | 41\n | 42\n | 45\n | 40\n | 35\n | 27\n | 21\n | 35\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 3\n |\n| Source 1: Met Office[162][163][164] Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute[165][166] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (percent sunshine and UV Index)[167] CEDA Archive[168] TORRO[169] Time and Date[170]\nSee Climate of London for additional climate information.\n |\n\n1. **^** London is not a city in the usual UK sense of having city status granted by the Crown.\n2. **^** See also: Independent city § National capitals\n3. **^** The Greater London Authority consists of the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.

These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)The West End theatre district in 2016\nSuch names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965, Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.[172] The City of London is the main financial district,[173] and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.\n\n\nThe West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists.[174] West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.[175] The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London.[176][177]\n\n\nThe East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London.[178] The surrounding East London area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.[178]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Architecture of London, List of tallest buildings and structures in London, and List of demolished buildings and structures in London\n\n![](image)The Tower of London, a medieval castle, dating in part to 1078\nLondon's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace.[179]\n\n\nPart of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by Christopher Wren, neoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey courthouse and the 1960s Barbican Estate. The 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington.[180] The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area and Canary Wharf, high residential densities in inner London, and lower densities in Outer London.\n\n\n\n![](image)The east wing public façade of Buckingham Palace was built between 1847 and 1850; it was remodelled to its present form in 1913.\n![](image)Trafalgar Square and its fountains, with Nelson's Column on the right\nThe Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column (built to commemorate Admiral Horatio Nelson) is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick, commonly the yellow London stock brick.[181]\n\n\nIn the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe (dubbed \"The Gherkin\"), Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings.[182] This protective policy, known as 'St Paul's Heights', has been in operation by the City of London since 1937.[182] Nevertheless, there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central London, including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the United Kingdom and Western Europe.[183]\n\n\nOther notable modern buildings include The Scalpel, 20 Fenchurch Street (dubbed \"The Walkie-Talkie\"), the former City Hall in Southwark, the Art Deco BBC Broadcasting House plus the Postmodernist British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross and No 1 Poultry by James Stirling. The BT Tower stands at 620 feet (189 m) and has a 360 degree coloured LED screen near the top. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the O2 Arena.[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Houses of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) on the right foreground, the London Eye on the left foreground and The Shard with Canary Wharf in the background; seen in September 2014\n\n### Natural history[edit]\n\n\nThe London Natural History Society suggests that London is \"one of the World's Greenest Cities\" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish.[185] They state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves.[186]\n\n\nAmphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, barred grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)A fox on Ayres Street, Southwark, South London\nAmong other inhabitants of London are 10,000 red foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (6 per square kilometre) of London. Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehog, brown rat, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and grey squirrel.[188] In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, a wide variety of mammals are found, including European hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to red fox, grey squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city.[189] Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, Nathusius' and common pipistrelles, common noctule, serotine, barbastelle, Daubenton's, brown long-eared, Natterer's and Leisler's.[190]\n\n\nHerds of red and fallow deer roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained.[191] Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.[192]\n\n\n\n## Demography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demography of London\n\n\n\n2021 Census - Population of London by country of birth[193]\n| Country of Birth | Population | Percent\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 5,223,986 | 59.4\n |\n| Non-United Kingdom | 3,575,739 | 40.6\n |\n|  | ![](image) India | 322,644 | 3.7\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | 175,991 | 2.0\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | 149,397 | 1.7\n |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh | 138,895 | 1.6\n |\n| ![](image) Pakistan | 129,774 | 1.5\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 126,059 | 1.4\n |\n| ![](image) Nigeria | 117,145 | 1.3\n |\n| ![](image) Ireland | 96,566 | 1.1\n |\n| ![](image) Sri Lanka | 80,379 | 0.9\n |\n| ![](image) France | 77,715 | 0.9\n |\n| Others | 2,161,174 | 24.6\n |\n| Total | 8,799,725 | 100.0\n |\n\n\n![](image)Population density map\nThe 2021 census recorded that 3,575,739 people or 40.6% of London's population were foreign-born,[194] making it among the cities with the largest immigrant population in terms of absolute numbers. About 69% of children born in London in 2015 had at least one parent who was born abroad.[195]\n\n\nThe population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter.[196] London's continuous urban area extends beyond Greater London and numbered 9,787,426 people in 2011,[29] while its wider metropolitan area had a population of 12–14 million, depending on the definition used.[197] According to Eurostat, London is the second most populous metropolitan area in Europe. A net 726,000 immigrants arrived there in the period 1991–2001.[198]\n\n\nThe region covers 610 square miles (1,579 km2), giving a population density of 13,410 inhabitants per square mile (5,177/km2)[144] more than ten times that of any other British region.[199] In population terms, London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region.[200]\n\n\n\n### Age structure and median age[edit]\n\n\nChildren younger than 14 constituted 20.6% of the population in Outer London in 2018, and 18% in Inner London. The 15–24 age group was 11.1% in Outer and 10.2% in Inner London, those aged 25–44 years 30.6% in Outer London and 39.7% in Inner London, those aged 45–64 years 24% and 20.7% in Outer and Inner London respectively. Those aged 65 and over are 13.6% in Outer London, but only 9.3% in Inner London.[201]\n\n\nThe median age of London's residents in 2018 was 36.5, which was younger than the UK median of 40.3.[201]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in London\n\nMaps of Greater London showing percentage distribution of selected ethnic groups according to the 2021 Census\n![White](image)\nWhite (53.8%)\n![Asian](image)\nAsian (20.8%)\n![Black](image)\nBlack (13.5%)\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, based on 2011 Census estimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 44.9% White British, 2.2% White Irish, 0.1% gypsy/Irish traveller and 12.1% classified as Other White.[202] Meanwhile, 20.9% of Londoners were of Asian or mixed-Asian descent, with 19.7% being of full Asian descents and 1.2% being of mixed-Asian heritage. Indians accounted for 6.6% of the population, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2.7% each. Chinese people accounted for 1.5%, and Arabs for 1.3%. A further 4.9% were classified as \"Other Asian\".[202]\n\n\n15.6% of London's population were of Black or mixed-Black descent. 13.3% were of full Black descent, with persons of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.3%. Black Africans accounted for 7.0% of London's population; 4.2% identified as Black Caribbean, and 2.1% as \"Other Black\". 5.0% were of mixed race.[202] The history of African presence extends back to the Roman period.[203]\n\n\nAs of 2007, one fifth of primary school students across London were from ethnic minorities.[204] Altogether at the 2011 census, of London's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4% were White, 19.8% Asian, 19% Black, 10.8% Mixed and 4% another ethnic group.[205] In January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that more than 300 languages were spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities had populations of more than 10,000.[206] Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that in 2021[update], London's foreign-born population was 3,346,000 (35%), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.[207]\n\n\nThe 2011 census showed that 36.7% of Greater London's population were born outside the UK.[208] Estimates by the Office for National Statistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in London from July 2009 to June 2010 were born in India, Poland, Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.[209] In the 2021 census 40.6% of London residents were foreign-born.[194] The ethnic demographics of the 2021 census were reported as 53.8% White, with White British reported at 36.8%, Asian or Asian British at 20.8%, Black or Black British at 13.5%, mixed 5.7% and other at 6.3%.[210]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in London\n\nSee also: List of churches in London\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, the largest religious groupings were Christians (48.4%), followed by those of no religion (20.7%), Muslims (12.4%), no response (8.5%), Hindus (5.0%), Jews (1.8%), Sikhs (1.5%), Buddhists (1.0%) and other (0.6%).[211]\n\n\nLondon has traditionally been Christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul's Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres,[212] while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth.[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSt Paul's Cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of London\n![](image)\nThe BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London is the second-largest Hindu temple in England and Europe.\n\nImportant national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey.[214] The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales.[215] Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is low within the denomination. Anglican Church attendance continues a long, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.[216]\n\n\nNotable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, which is allowed to give the Islamic call to prayer through loudspeakers, the London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park[217] and the Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. After the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Middle-Eastern Arab Muslims based themselves around Mayfair, Kensington and Knightsbridge in West London.[218][219][220] There are large Bengali Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.[221]\n\n\nLarge Hindu communities are found in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter hosting what was until 2006[222] Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple.[223] London is home to 44 Hindu temples, including the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.[224]\n\n\nThe majority of British Jews live in London, with notable Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley, Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware, all in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London is affiliated to London's historic Sephardic Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe to have held regular services continually for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any Orthodox synagogue in Europe.[225] The London Jewish Forum was set up in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.[226]\n\n\n\n### Accents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Traditionally, anyone born within earshot of the bells of St Mary-le-Bow church was considered to be a true Cockney.[227]\nCockney is an accent heard across London, mainly spoken by working-class and lower-middle class Londoners. It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East London, having originated there in the 18th century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older.[228] Some features of Cockney include, *Th*-fronting (pronouncing \"th\" as \"f\"), \"th\" inside a word is pronounced with a \"v\", *H*-dropping, and, like most English accents, a Cockney accent drops the \"r\" after a vowel.[229] John Camden Hotten, in his *Slang Dictionary* of 1859, makes reference to Cockney \"use of a peculiar slang language\" (Cockney rhyming slang) when describing the costermongers of the East End. Since the start of the 21st century the extreme form of the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties.[230]\n\n\nEstuary English is an intermediate accent between Cockney and Received Pronunciation.[231] It is widely spoken by people of all classes.[232]\n\n\nMulticultural London English (MLE) is a multiethnolect becoming increasingly common in multicultural areas amongst young, working-class people from diverse backgrounds. It is a fusion of an array of ethnic accents, in particular Afro-Caribbean and South Asian, with a significant Cockney influence.[233]\n\n\nReceived Pronunciation (RP) is the accent traditionally regarded as the standard for British English.[234] It has no specific geographical correlate,[235] although it is also traditionally defined as the standard speech used in London and south-eastern England.[236] It is mainly spoken by upper-class and upper-middle class Londoners.[237]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of London\n\n![](image)The City of London, one of the largest financial centres in the world[238]\nLondon's gross regional product in 2019 was £503 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP.[239] London has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world.[240] London is the world's most expensive office market according to world property journal (2015) report.[241] As of 2015[update] the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion.[242] The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics.[243] On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities.[244]\n\n\n\n### City of London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The London Stock Exchange at Paternoster Square and Temple Bar\n![](image)The Royal Exchange in 1886\nLondon's finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major business districts. London is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance.[245] London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. Also, London's market-centred system (as opposed to the bank-centred one in Amsterdam) grew more dominant in the 18th century.[72] The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time.[76] This economic strength of the city was attributed to its diversity.[246][247]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bank of England, established in 1694, is the model on which most modern central banks are based.\nBy the mid-19th century, London was the leading financial centre, and at the end of the century over half the world's trade was financed in British currency.[248] Still, as of 2016[update] London tops the world rankings on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI),[249] and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney's 2018 Global Cities Index.[250]\n\n\nLondon's largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 per cent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS.[251] Over 85 per cent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London's economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. However, by 2010 the city had recovered, put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London's economic dominance.[252] Along with professional services headquarters, the City of London is home to the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd's of London insurance market.[253]\n\n\nOver half the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London.[254] In a 1992 report commissioned by the London Stock Exchange, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of his family's confectionery company Cadbury, produced the Cadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world.[255]\n\n\n\n### Media and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in London\n\n![](image)Broadcasting House in central London, headquarters of the BBC\nMedia companies are concentrated in London, and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector.[256] The BBC, the world's oldest national broadcaster, is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city. Many national newspapers, including *The Times*, founded in 1785, are edited in London; the term Fleet Street (where most national newspapers operated) remains a metonym for the British national press. London is one of the world's largest retail destinations, with the city frequently ranking at or near the top of retail sales of any city.[257][258] In 2017 it was ranked the top city for luxury store openings.[259] The Port of London is the second largest in the UK, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.[260]\n\n\nA growing number of technology companies are based in London, notably in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In 2014 the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD.[261] In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future in the 2014/15 list by *fDi Intelligence*.[262] A museum in Bletchley Park, where Alan Turing was based during World War II, is in Bletchley, 40 miles (64 km) north of central London, as is The National Museum of Computing.[263]\n\n\nThe gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN[264] and UK Power Networks.[265]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in London\n\n![](image)\nThe British Museum\n![](image)\nThe National Gallery\n\nLondon is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits.[266] It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015.[267] Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing 700,000 full-time workers in 2016, and contributes £36 billion a year to the economy.[268] The city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK.[269] As of 2016[update] London was the world top city destination as ranked by TripAdvisor users.[270]\n\n\nIn 2015 the top most-visited attractions in the UK were all in London. The top 10 most visited attractions were: (with visits per venue)[271]\n\n\n\n1. British Museum: 6,820,686\n2. National Gallery: 5,908,254\n3. Natural History Museum (South Kensington): 5,284,023\n4. Southbank Centre: 5,102,883\n5. Tate Modern: 4,712,581\n6. Victoria and Albert Museum (South Kensington): 3,432,325\n7. Science Museum: 3,356,212\n8. Somerset House: 3,235,104\n9. Tower of London: 2,785,249\n10. National Portrait Gallery: 2,145,486\n\n\nThe number of hotel rooms in London in 2015 stood at 138,769, and is expected to grow over the years.[272]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in London and Infrastructure in London\n\nTransport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,[273] but the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer-distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL).[109]\n\n\nThe lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board or *London Transport* was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.[274]\n\n\n\n### Aviation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Airports of London\n\n![](image)Heathrow Airport is the busiest airport in Europe as well as the second busiest in the world for international passenger traffic (Terminal 5C is pictured).\nLondon is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word *London* in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights.\n\n\n\n* Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, was for many years the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways.[275] In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened.[276]\n* Gatwick Airport, south of London in West Sussex, handles flights to more destinations than any other UK airport and is the main base of easyJet, the UK's largest airline by number of passengers.[277]\n* Stansted Airport, north-east of London in Essex, has flights that serve the greatest number of European destinations of any UK airport and is the main base of Ryanair, the world's largest international airline by number of international passengers.[278]\n* Luton Airport, to the north of London in Bedfordshire, is used by several budget airlines (especially easyJet and Wizz Air) for short-haul flights.[279]\n* London City Airport, the most central airport and the one with the shortest runway, in Newham, East London, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full-service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.[280]\n* Southend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller, regional airport that caters for short-haul flights on a limited, though growing, number of airlines.[281] In 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend, the highest proportion of any London airport.[282]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n#### Underground and DLR[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The London Underground is the world's oldest and third-longest rapid transit system.\nOpened in 1863, the London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world.[283][284] The system serves 272 stations, and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway, which opened in 1890.[285]\n\n\nOver four million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year.[286] An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics.[287] The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Suburban[edit]\n\n\nThere are 368 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports.[289] London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers—Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year.[290] Clapham Junction is one of Europe's busiest rail interchanges.[291]\n\n\nWith the need for more rail capacity, the Elizabeth Line (also known as Crossrail) opened in May 2022.[292] It is a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport.[293] It was Europe's biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost.[294]\n\n\n\n#### Inter-city and international[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St Pancras International is the main terminal for high-speed Eurostar and High Speed 1 services, as well as commuter suburban Thameslink and inter-city East Midlands Railway services.\nLondon is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 per cent of rail journeys starting or ending in London.[295] King's Cross station and Euston station, both in London, are the starting points of the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line – the two main railway lines in Britain. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, directly linking London with most of Great Britain's major cities and towns.[296] *The Flying Scotsman* is an express passenger train service that has operated between London and Edinburgh since 1862; the world famous steam locomotive named after this service, *Flying Scotsman*, was the first locomotive to reach the officially authenticated speed of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h) in 1934.[297]\n\n\nSome international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Calais, Paris, Disneyland Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel.[298] The first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London.[299] There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.[300]\n\n\n\n### Buses, coaches and trams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A New Routemaster (which replaced the AEC Routemaster) entered service in 2012. The red double-decker bus is an emblematic symbol of London.\nLondon's bus network runs 24 hours a day with about 9,300 vehicles, over 675 bus routes and about 19,000 bus stops.[301] In 2019 the network had over 2 billion commuter trips per year.[302] Since 2010 an average of £1.2 billion is taken in revenue each year.[303] London has one of the largest wheelchair-accessible networks in the world[304] and from the third quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced.[305]\n\n\nLondon's coach hub is Victoria Coach Station, opened in 1932. Nationalised in 1970 and subsequently purchased by London Transport which then became Transport for London, Victoria Coach Station has over 14 million passengers a year and provides services across the UK and continental Europe.[306]\n\n\nLondon has a modern tram network, known as Tramlink. It has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013.[307] Since June 2008, Transport for London has completely owned and operated Tramlink.[308]\n\n\n\n### Cable car[edit]\n\n\nLondon's first and to date only cable car is the London Cable Car, which opened in June 2012. The cable car crosses the Thames and links Greenwich Peninsula with the Royal Docks in the east of the city. It is able to carry up to 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times.[309]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cycling in London\n\n![](image)Santander Cycle Hire, near Victoria in Central London\nIn the Greater London Area, around 670,000 people use a bike every day,[310] meaning around 7% of the total population of around 8.8 million use a bike on an average day.[311] Cycling has become an increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of a bicycle hire scheme in July 2010 was successful and generally well received.[312]\n\n\n\n### Port and river boats[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of London, once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009.[260] Most of this cargo passes through the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London.[260]\n\n\nLondon has river boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers, which offer both commuter and tourist boat services.[313] At major piers including Canary Wharf, London Bridge City, Battersea Power Station and London Eye (Waterloo), services depart at least every 20 minutes during commuter times.[314] The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads.[315]\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at 117 miles (188 km) long.[316] The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh.[317]\n\n\n\n![](image)The hackney carriage (black cab) is a common sight on London streets. Although traditionally black, this is not a requirement with some painted in other colours or bearing advertising.\nThe Austin Motor Company began making hackney carriages (London taxis) in 1929, and models include Austin FX3 from 1948, Austin FX4 from 1958, with more recent models TXII and TX4 manufactured by London Taxis International. The BBC states, \"ubiquitous black cabs and red double-decker buses all have long and tangled stories that are deeply embedded in London's traditions\".[318]\n\n\nLondon is notorious for its traffic congestion; in 2009, the average speed of a car in the rush hour was recorded at 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).[319] In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London.[320] Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass.[321] Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars.[322]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in London\n\n### Tertiary education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of universities and higher education colleges in London\n\n![](image)University College London (UCL), established by Royal Charter in 1836, is one of the founding colleges of the University of London.\n![](image)Imperial College London, a technical research university in South Kensington\nLondon is a major global centre of higher education teaching and research and has the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.[19] According to the QS World University Rankings 2015/16, London has the greatest concentration of top class universities in the world[323] and its international student population of around 110,000 is larger than any other city in the world.[324] A 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers report termed London the global capital of higher education.[325]\nA number of world-leading education institutions are based in London. In the 2022 *QS World University Rankings*, Imperial College London is ranked No. 6 in the world, University College London (UCL) is ranked 8th, and King's College London (KCL) is ranked 37th.[326] All are regularly ranked highly, with Imperial College being the UK's leading university in the Research Excellence Framework ranking 2021.[327] The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research.[328] The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2015 its MBA programme was ranked second-best in the world by the *Financial Times*.[329] The city is also home to three of the world's top ten performing arts schools (as ranked by the 2020 QS World University Rankings[330]): the Royal College of Music (ranking 2nd in the world), the Royal Academy of Music (ranking 4th) and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (ranking 6th).[331]\n\n\nWith students in London and around 48,000 in University of London Worldwide,[332] the federal University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the UK.[333] It includes five multi-faculty universities – City, King's College London, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway and UCL – and a number of smaller and more specialised institutions including Birkbeck, the Courtauld Institute of Art, Goldsmiths, the London Business School, the London School of Economics, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Royal Academy of Music, the Central School of Speech and Drama, the Royal Veterinary College and the School of Oriental and African Studies.[334]\n\n\nUniversities in London outside the University of London system include Brunel University, Imperial College London,[note 1] Kingston University, London Metropolitan University, University of East London, University of West London, University of Westminster, London South Bank University, Middlesex University, and University of the Arts London (the largest university of art, design, fashion, communication and the performing arts in Europe).[335] In addition, there are three international universities – Regent's University London, Richmond, The American International University in London and Schiller International University.\n\n\nLondon is home to five major medical schools – Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry (part of Queen Mary), King's College London School of Medicine (the largest medical school in Europe), Imperial College School of Medicine, UCL Medical School and St George's, University of London – and has many affiliated teaching hospitals. It is also a major centre for biomedical research, and three of the UK's eight academic health science centres are based in the city – Imperial College Healthcare, King's Health Partners and UCL Partners (the largest such centre in Europe).[336] Additionally, many biomedical and biotechnology spin out companies from these research institutions are based around the city, most prominently in White City. Founded by pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale at St Thomas' Hospital in 1860, the first nursing school is now part of King's College London.[337] It was at King's in 1952 where a team led by Rosalind Franklin captured *Photo 51*, the critical evidence in identifying the structure of DNA.[338] There are a number of business schools in London, including the London School of Business and Finance, Cass Business School (part of City University London), Hult International Business School, ESCP Europe, European Business School London, Imperial College Business School, the London Business School and the UCL School of Management.\n\n\n\n![](image)Opened in 1906, the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama is a member of Conservatoires UK and the Federation of Drama Schools.\nLondon is also home to many specialist arts education institutions, including the Central School of Ballet, London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), London College of Contemporary Arts (LCCA), London Contemporary Dance School, National Centre for Circus Arts, Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA; president Sir Kenneth Branagh), Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance, the Royal College of Art, Sylvia Young Theatre School and Trinity Laban. The BRIT School in the London borough of Croydon provides training for the performing arts and technologies.[339]\n\n\n\n### Primary and secondary education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Centre for School Design\n\nThe majority of primary and secondary schools and further-education colleges in London are controlled by the London boroughs or otherwise state-funded; leading examples include Ashbourne College, Bethnal Green Academy, Brampton Manor Academy, City and Islington College, City of Westminster College, David Game College, Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, Leyton Sixth Form College, London Academy of Excellence, Tower Hamlets College, and Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre. There are also a number of private schools and colleges in London, some old and famous, such as City of London School, Harrow, St Paul's School, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, University College School, The John Lyon School, Highgate School and Westminster School.\n\n\n\n### Royal Observatory, Greenwich and learned societies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tourists queuing to take pictures on the line of the historic prime meridian at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The observatory has played a major role in the history of navigation and astronomy.\nFounded in 1675, the Royal Observatory in Greenwich was established to address the problem of calculating longitude for navigational purposes. This pioneering work in solving longitude featured in astronomer royal Nevil Maskelyne's *Nautical Almanac* which made the Greenwich meridian the universal reference point, and helped lead to the international adoption of Greenwich as the prime meridian (0° longitude) in 1884.[340]\n\n\nImportant scientific learned societies based in London include the Royal Society—the UK's national academy of sciences and the oldest national scientific institution in the world—founded in 1660,[341] and the Royal Institution, founded in 1799. Since 1825, the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures have presented scientific subjects to a general audience, and speakers have included aerospace engineer Frank Whittle, naturalist David Attenborough and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.[342]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of London\n\n### Leisure and entertainment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of annual events in London and West End theatre\n\nLeisure is a major part of the London economy. A 2003 report attributed a quarter of the entire UK leisure economy to London[343] at 25.6 events per 1000 people.[344] The city is one of the four fashion capitals of the world, and, according to official statistics, is the world's third-busiest film production centre, presents more live comedy than any other city,[345] and has the biggest theatre audience of any city in the world.[346]\n\n\n\n![](image)Harrods department store in Knightsbridge\nWithin the City of Westminster in London, the entertainment district of the West End has its focus around Leicester Square, where London and world film premieres are held, and Piccadilly Circus, with its giant electronic advertisements.[347] London's theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs, and restaurants, including the city's Chinatown district (in Soho), and just to the east is Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops. The city is the home of Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have dominated West End theatre since the late 20th century.[348] Agatha Christie's *The Mousetrap*, the world's longest-running play, has been performed in the West End since 1952.[349] The Laurence Olivier Awards–named after Laurence Olivier–are given annually by the Society of London Theatre. The Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Royal Opera, and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House, the London Coliseum, Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the Royal Albert Hall, as well as touring the country.[350]\n\n\nIslington's 1 mile (1.6 km) long Upper Street, extending northwards from Angel, has more bars and restaurants than any other street in the UK.[351] Europe's busiest shopping area is Oxford Street, a shopping street nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) long, making it the longest shopping street in the UK. It is home to vast numbers of retailers and department stores, including Selfridges flagship store.[352] Knightsbridge, home to the equally renowned Harrods department store, lies to the south-west. Opened in 1760 with its flagship store on Regent Street since 1881, Hamleys is the oldest toy store in the world.[353] Madame Tussauds wax museum opened in Baker Street in 1835, an era viewed as being when London's tourism industry began.[354]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scene of the annual Notting Hill Carnival, 2014\nLondon is home to designers John Galliano, Stella McCartney, Manolo Blahnik, and Jimmy Choo, among others; its renowned art and fashion schools make it one of the four international centres of fashion. Mary Quant designed the miniskirt in her King's Road boutique in Swinging Sixties London.[355] London offers a great variety of cuisine as a result of its ethnically diverse population. Gastronomic centres include the Bangladeshi restaurants of Brick Lane and the Chinese restaurants of Chinatown.[356] There are Chinese takeaways throughout London, as are Indian restaurants which provide Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine.[357] Around 1860, the first fish and chips shop in London was opened by Joseph Malin, a Jewish immigrant, in Bow.[318][358] The full English breakfast dates from the Victorian era, and many cafes in London serve a full English breakfast throughout the day.[359] London has five 3-Michelin star restaurants, including Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea.[360] Many hotels in London provide a traditional afternoon tea service, such as the Oscar Wilde Lounge at the Hotel Café Royal in Piccadilly, and a themed tea service is also available, for example an *Alice in Wonderland* themed afternoon tea served at the Egerton House Hotel, and *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* themed afternoon tea at One Aldwych in Covent Garden.[361][362] The nation's most popular biscuit to dunk in tea, chocolate digestives have been manufactured by McVitie's at their Harlesden factory in north-west London since 1925.[363]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shakespeare's Globe is a modern reconstruction of the Globe Theatre on the south bank of the Thames.\nThere is a variety of annual events, beginning with the relatively new New Year's Day Parade, a fireworks display at the London Eye; the world's second largest street party, the Notting Hill Carnival, is held on the late August Bank Holiday each year. Traditional parades include November's Lord Mayor's Show, a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the city, and June's Trooping the Colour, a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen's Official Birthday.[364] The Boishakhi Mela is a Bengali New Year festival celebrated by the British Bangladeshi community. It is the largest open-air Asian festival in Europe. After the Notting Hill Carnival, it is the second-largest street festival in the United Kingdom attracting over 80,000 visitors.[365] First held in 1862, the RHS Chelsea Flower Show (run by the Royal Horticultural Society) takes place in May every year.[366]\n\n\n\n### LGBT scene[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LGBT culture in London\n\nThe first gay bar in London in the modern sense was The Cave of the Golden Calf, established as a night club in an underground location at 9 Heddon Street, just off Regent Street, in 1912 and \"which developed a reputation for sexual freedom and tolerance of same-sex relations.\"[367]\n\n\n\n![](image)Comptons of Soho during London Pride in 2010\nWhile London has been an LGBT tourism destination, after homosexuality was decriminalised in England in 1967 gay bar culture became more visible, and from the early 1970s Soho (and in particular Old Compton Street) became the centre of the London LGBT community.[368] G-A-Y, previously based at the Astoria, and now Heaven, is a long-running night club.[369]\n\n\nWider British cultural movements have influenced LGBT culture: for example, the emergence of glam rock in the UK in the early 1970s, via Marc Bolan and David Bowie, saw a generation of teenagers begin playing with the idea of androgyny, and the West End musical *The Rocky Horror Show*, which debuted in London in 1973, is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements.[370] The Blitz Kids (which included Boy George) frequented the Tuesday club-night at Blitz in Covent Garden, helping launch the New Romantic subcultural movement in the late 1970s.[371] Today, the annual London Pride Parade and the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival are held in the city.[368]\n\n\n\n### Literature, film and television[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: London in fiction, London in film, List of television shows set in London, and London Television Archive\n\n![](image)Sherlock Holmes Museum in Baker Street, bearing the number 221B\nLondon has been the setting for many works of literature. The pilgrims in Geoffrey Chaucer's late 14th-century *Canterbury Tales* set out for Canterbury from London. William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based there, and some of his work, most notably his play *The Alchemist*, was set in the city.[372] *A Journal of the Plague Year* (1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague.[372]\n\n\nThe literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire; Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has influenced people's vision of early Victorian London; and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.[372] Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.[372] Robert Louis Stevenson mixed in London literary circles, and in 1886 he wrote the *Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*, a gothic novella set in Victorian London.[373] In 1898, H. G. Wells' sci-fi novel *The War of the Worlds* sees London (and the south of England) invaded by Martians.[374] Letitia Elizabeth Landon wrote *Calendar of the London Seasons* in 1834. Modern writers influenced by the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of a \"biography\" of London, and Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography. In the 1940s, George Orwell wrote essays in the *London Evening Standard*, most notably \"A Nice Cup of Tea\" (method for making tea) and \"The Moon Under Water\" (an ideal pub).[375] The WWII evacuation of children from London is depicted in C. S. Lewis' first Narnia book *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* (1950). On Christmas Eve 1925, Winnie-the-Pooh debuted in London's *Evening News*, with the character based on a stuffed toy A. A. Milne bought for his son Christopher Robin in Harrods.[376] In 1958, author Michael Bond created Paddington Bear, a refugee found in London Paddington station. A screen adaptation, *Paddington* (2014), features the calypso song \"London is the Place for Me\".[377]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**'Calendar of the London Seasons', by L.

The largest cinema chain in the country, Odeon Cinemas was founded in London in 1928 by Oscar Deutsch.[382] The British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) have been held in London since 1949, with the BAFTA Fellowship the Academy's highest accolade.[383] Founded in 1957, the BFI London Film Festival takes place over two weeks every October.[384]\n\n\nLondon is a major centre for television production, with studios including Television Centre, ITV Studios, Sky Campus and Fountain Studios; the latter hosted the original talent shows, *Pop Idol*, *The X Factor*, and *Britain's Got Talent*, before each format was exported around the world.[385][386] Formerly a franchise of ITV, Thames Television featured comedians such as Benny Hill and Rowan Atkinson (*Mr. Bean* was first screened by Thames), while Talkback produced *Da Ali G Show* which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as Ali G.[387] Many television shows have been set in London, including the popular television soap opera *EastEnders*.[388]\n\n\n\n### Museums, art galleries and libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Albertopolis. The Albert Memorial, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Geographical Society, and Royal College of Art are visible near the top; Victoria and Albert Museum and Natural History Museum at the lower end; Imperial College, Royal College of Music, and Science Museum lying in between.\nLondon is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753.[389] Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824, the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square.[390]\n\n\nThe British Library is the second largest library in the world, and the national library of the United Kingdom.[391] There are many other research libraries, including the Wellcome Library and Dana Centre, as well as university libraries, including the British Library of Political and Economic Science at LSE, the Abdus Salam Library at Imperial, the Maughan Library at King's, and the Senate House Libraries at the University of London.[392]\n\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as \"Albertopolis\", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits.[393] The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art. In 2000, this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station which is accessed by pedestrians north of the Thames via the Millennium Bridge.[394]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Royal Albert Hall hosts concerts and musical events, including The Proms which are held every summer, as well as cinema screenings of films accompanied with live orchestral music.\nLondon is one of the major classical and popular music capitals of the world and hosts major music corporations, such as Universal Music Group International and Warner Music Group, and countless bands, musicians and industry professionals. The city is also home to many orchestras and concert halls, such as the Barbican Arts Centre (principal base of the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus), the Southbank Centre (London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra), Cadogan Hall (Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) and the Royal Albert Hall (The Proms).[350] The Proms, an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music first held in 1895, ends with the Last Night of the Proms. London's two main opera houses are the Royal Opera House and the London Coliseum (home to the English National Opera).[350] The UK's largest pipe organ is at the Royal Albert Hall. Other significant instruments are in cathedrals and major churches—the church bells of St Clement Danes feature in the 1744 nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\".[395] Several conservatoires are within the city: Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity Laban. The record label EMI was formed in the city in 1931, and an early employee for the company, Alan Blumlein, created stereo sound that year.[396]\n\n\n\n![](image)Abbey Road Studios in Abbey Road\nLondon has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts, including the world's busiest indoor venue, the O2 Arena,[397] and Wembley Arena, as well as many mid-sized venues, such as Brixton Academy, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd's Bush Empire.[350] Several music festivals, including the Wireless Festival, Lovebox and Hyde Park's British Summer Time, are held in London.[398]\n\n\nThe city is home to the original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles recorded many of their hits. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, musicians and groups like Elton John, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, Queen, Eric Clapton, the Who, Cliff Richard, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Deep Purple, T. Rex, the Police, Elvis Costello, Dire Straits, Cat Stevens, Fleetwood Mac, the Cure, Madness, Culture Club, Dusty Springfield, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Status Quo and Sade, derived their sound from the streets and rhythms of London.[399][400]\n\n\nLondon was instrumental in the development of punk music, with figures such as the Sex Pistols, the Clash and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood all based in the city.[401][402] Other artists to emerge from the London music scene include George Michael, Kate Bush, Seal, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, the Prodigy, Gorillaz, Mumford & Sons, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Dua Lipa and Florence and the Machine.[403] Artists from London played a prominent role in the development of synth-pop, including Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, the Pet Shop Boys and Eurythmics; the latter's \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" was recorded in the attic of their north London home, heralding a trend for home recording methods.[404] Artists from London with a Caribbean influence include Hot Chocolate, Billy Ocean, Soul II Soul and Eddy Grant, with the latter fusing reggae, soul and samba with rock and pop.[405] London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of house, hip hop, and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and in the rest of the United Kingdom. The British Phonographic Industry's annual popular music awards, the Brit Awards, are held in London.[406]\n\n\n\n## Recreation[edit]\n\n\n### Parks and open spaces[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Parks and open spaces in London and Royal Parks of London\n\nSee also: List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater London and List of local nature reserves in Greater London\n\n![](image)Hyde Park (with Kensington Gardens in foreground) has been a popular public space since it opened in 1637.\nA 2013 report by the City of London Corporation said that London is the \"greenest city\" in Europe with 35,000 acres (14,164 hectares) of public parks, woodlands and gardens.[407] The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the eight Royal Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens in the west, and Regent's Park to the north.[408] Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts. Regent's Park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is near Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.[409] Primrose Hill is a popular spot from which to view the city skyline.[410]\n\n\nClose to Hyde Park are smaller Royal Parks, Green Park and St. James's Park.[411] A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including Hampstead Heath and the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the southeast, and Bushy Park and Richmond Park (the largest) to the southwest. Hampton Court Park is also a royal park, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks.[412]\n\n\nClose to Richmond Park is Kew Gardens, which has the world's largest collection of living plants. In 2003, the gardens were put on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.[413] There are also parks administered by London's borough Councils, including Victoria Park in the East End and Battersea Park in the centre. Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including Hampstead Heath and Epping Forest,[414] both controlled by the City of London Corporation.[415] Hampstead Heath incorporates Kenwood House, a former stately home and a popular location in the summer months when classical musical concerts are held by the lake.[416] Epping Forest is a popular venue for various outdoor activities, including mountain biking, walking, horse riding, golf, angling, and orienteering.[414] Three of the UK's most-visited theme parks, Thorpe Park near Staines-upon-Thames, Chessington World of Adventures in Chessington and Legoland Windsor, are located within 20 miles (32 km) of London.[417]\n\n\n\n### Walking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Horse Ride is a tree tunnel (route overhung by trees) on the western side of Wimbledon Common.\nWalking is a popular recreational activity in London. Areas that provide for walks include Wimbledon Common, Epping Forest, Hampton Court Park, Hampstead Heath, the eight Royal Parks, canals and disused railway tracks.[418] Access to canals and rivers has improved recently, including the creation of the Thames Path, some 28 miles (45 km) of which is within Greater London, and The Wandle Trail along the River Wandle.[419]\n\n\nOther long-distance paths, linking green spaces, have also been created, including the Capital Ring, the Green Chain Walk, London Outer Orbital Path (\"Loop\"), Jubilee Walkway, Lea Valley Walk, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk.[418]\n\n\n\n## Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in London\n\nSee also: Football in London and Rugby union in London\n\n![](image)\nWembley Stadium, home of the England men and women's football team and the FA Cup Final, has a seating capacity of 90,000.

Since the 19th century,[11] the name \"London\" also refers to the metropolis around this core, historically split among the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London,[13] which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.[note 3][14]\n\n\nAs one of the world's major global cities,[15] London exerts a strong influence on world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, transport, and communications.[16][17] Its GDP of €801.66 billion in 2017 makes it the largest urban economy in Europe,[18] and it is one of the major financial centres in the world. With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions,[19] it is home to some of the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world—Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London.[20][21] London is the most visited city in Europe and has the busiest city airport system in the world.[22] The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.[23]\n\n\nLondon's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages.[24] The 2023 population of Greater London of just under 10 million[25] made it Europe's third-most populous city,[26] accounting for 13.4% of the population of the United Kingdom[27] and over 16% of the population of England. The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, with about 9.8 million inhabitants at the 2011 census.[28][29] The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, with about 14 million inhabitants in 2016,[note 4][30][31] granting London the status of a megacity.\n\n\nLondon has four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the combined Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and also the historic settlement in Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, defines the prime meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time.[32] Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. London has many museums, galleries, libraries, and cultural venues, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library, and numerous West End theatres.[33] Important sporting events held in London include the FA Cup Final, the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, and the London Marathon. In 2012, London became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games.[34]\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Etymology of London\n\n*London* is an ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form *Londinium*.[35] Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually *Londinium*), Old English (usually *Lunden*), and Welsh (usually *Llundein*), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as \\**Londonjon* or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as *Londinium* and borrowed into Old English.[36]\n\n\nUntil 1889, the name \"London\" applied officially only to the City of London, but since then it has also referred to the County of London and to Greater London.[37]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of London\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of London.\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream from Vauxhall Bridge.[38] Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BC.[38] In 2010, foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BC,[39] were found on the Thames's south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge.[40] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames.[40]\n\n\n\n### Roman London[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Londinium\n\n![](image)Reconstruction drawing of Londinium in 120 AD\nDespite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans around 47 AD,[2] about four years after their invasion of 43 AD.[41] This only lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the ground.[42]\n\n\nThe next planned incarnation of Londinium prospered, superseding Colchester as the principal city of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of about 60,000.[43]\n\n\n\n### Anglo-Saxon and Viking-period London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally.\nWith the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about 450.[44] From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city.[45] By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.[46]\n\n\nThe Vikings applied Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England, its boundary running roughly from London to Chester as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* records that Alfred \"refounded\" London in 886. Archaeological research shows this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about 950.[47]\n\n\nBy the 11th century, London was clearly the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: \"It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Westminster Abbey, as seen in this painting (by Canaletto, 1749), is a World Heritage Site and one of London's oldest and most important buildings.\nAfter winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.[49] William built the Tower of London, the first of many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south-eastern corner of the city, to intimidate the inhabitants.[50] In 1097, William II began building Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. It became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.[51]\n\n\nIn the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto followed the royal English court around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed, for most purposes at Westminster, although the royal treasury came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true governmental capital, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was some 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.[52] With the Black Death in the mid-14th century, London lost nearly a third of its population.[53] London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.[54]\n\n\nLondon was a centre of England's Jewish population before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290. Violence against Jews occurred in 1190, when it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation.[55] In 1264 during the Second Barons' War, Simon de Montfort's rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.[56]\n\n\n\n### Early modern[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of London in 1593. There is only one bridge across the Thames, but parts of Southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed.\nDuring the Tudor period, the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism. Much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.[57] In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up a main trading base (*kontor*) of England in London, called the *Stalhof* or *Steelyard*. It remained until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway.[58] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries.[59]\n\n\nYet English maritime enterprise hardly reached beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean was normally through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. The reopening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 spurred a burst of commercial activity.[60] The Royal Exchange was founded.[61] Mercantilism grew and monopoly traders such as the East India Company were founded as trade expanded to the New World. London became the main North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from about 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.[57]\n\n\nIn the 16th century, William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London during English Renaissance theatre. Shakespeare's Globe Theatre was constructed in 1599 in Southwark. Stage performances came to a halt in London when Puritan authorities shut down the theatres in the 1640s and 1650s.[62] The ban on theatre was lifted during the Restoration in 1660, and London's oldest operating theatre, Drury Lane, opened in 1663 in what is now the West End theatre district.[63]\n\n\nBy the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot of 5 November 1605.[64] In 1637, the government of Charles I attempted to reform administration in the London area. This called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the Liberties of London, coupled with a lack of interest in administering these additional areas or concern by city guilds of having to share power, caused the Corporation's \"The Great Refusal\", a decision which largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the City.[65]\n\n\nIn the English Civil War, the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.[66]\nThe fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647,[67] and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666.\nLondon was plagued by disease in the early 17th century,[69] culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.[69]\n\n\nThe Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[70] Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by polymath Robert Hooke.[71] In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral, was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 18th century.[72]\n\n\nIn 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House, which was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was said to be dogged by crime,[73] and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force.[74] Epidemics during the 1720s and 30s saw most children born in the city die before reaching their fifth birthday.[75]\n\n\nCoffee-houses became a popular place to debate ideas, as growing literacy and development of the printing press made news widely available, with Fleet Street becoming the centre of the British press. The invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies led many financiers to relocate to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world's leading war fleet, acting as a major deterrent to potential economic adversaries. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.[76]\n\n\n\n### Late modern and contemporary[edit]\n\n\nWith the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, an unprecedented growth in urbanisation took place, and the number of High Streets (the primary street for retail in Britain) rapidly grew.[77][78] London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925, with a population density of 802 per acre (325 per hectare).[79] In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods, such as Harding, Howell & Co.—one of the first department stores—located on Pall Mall, the streets had scores of street sellers.[77] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[80] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital.[81]\n\n\nFrom the early years of the 20th century onwards, teashops were found on High Streets across London and the rest of Britain, with Lyons, who opened the first of their chain of teashops in Piccadilly in 1894, leading the way.[82] The tearooms, such as the Criterion in Piccadilly, became a popular meeting place for women from the suffrage movement.[83] The city was the target of many attacks during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, between 1912 and 1914, which saw historic landmarks such as Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral bombed.[84]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBritish volunteer recruits in London, August 1914, during World War I\n![](image)\nA bombed-out London street during the Blitz, World War II\n\nLondon was bombed by the Germans in the First World War, and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German *Luftwaffe* killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city.[85] The tomb of the Unknown Warrior, an unidentified member of the British armed forces killed during the First World War, was buried in Westminster Abbey on 11 November 1920.[86] The Cenotaph, located in Whitehall, was unveiled on the same day, and is the focal point for the National Service of Remembrance held annually on Remembrance Sunday, the closest Sunday to 11 November.[87]\n\n\nThe 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, while London was still recovering from the war.[88] From the 1940s, London became home to many immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan,[89] making London one of the most diverse cities in the world. In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank.[90] The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the \"pea soup fogs\" for which London had been notorious, and had earned it the nickname the \"Big Smoke\".[91]\n\n\nStarting mainly in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London sub-culture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street.[92] The role of trendsetter revived in the punk era.[93] In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded in response to the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created.[94] During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was hit from 1973 by bomb attacks by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.[95] These attacks lasted for two decades, starting with the Old Bailey bombing.[95] Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.[96]\n\n\nGreater London's population declined in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s.[97] The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was born out of London's increasing role as an international financial centre in the 1980s.[98] Located about 2 miles (3.2 km) east of central London, the Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.[99]\n\n\nThe Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, leaving London with no central administration until 2000 and the creation of the Greater London Authority.[100] To mark the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed.[101] On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, as the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times.[34] On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.[95]\n\n\nIn 2008, *Time* named London alongside New York City and Hong Kong as Nylonkong, hailing them as the world's three most influential global cities.[102] In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, its highest since 1939.[103] During the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but most London constituencies voted for remaining.[104] However, Britain's exit from the EU in early 2021 only marginally weakened London's position as an international financial centre.[105]\n\n\nOn 6 May 2023, the coronation of Charles III and his wife, Camilla, as king and queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, took place at Westminster Abbey, London.[106]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\n### Local government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Local government in London, History of local government in London, and List of heads of London government\n\n![](image)Arms of the Corporation of the City of London[107]\nThe administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.[108] The GLA consists of two elected components: the mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year. The GLA has responsibility for the majority of London's transport system through its functional arm Transport for London (TfL), it is responsible for overseeing the city's police and fire services, and also for setting a strategic vision for London on a range of issues.[109] The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Newham. The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital.[110] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.[111]\n\n\nThe local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation.[112] They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, libraries, leisure and recreation, social services, local roads and refuse collection.[113] Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).[114]\n\n\nThe London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London, run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. It is the third largest fire service in the world.[115] National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world.[116] The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames, which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.[117]\n\n\n\n### National government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)10 Downing Street, official residence of the Prime Minister\nLondon is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many government departments, as well as the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall.[118] There are 73 members of Parliament (MPs) from London; As of December 2019[update], 49 are from the Labour Party, 21 are Conservatives, and three are Liberal Democrats.[119] The ministerial post of minister for London was created in 1994 and as of 2020 is held by Paul Scully.[120]\n\n\n\n### Policing and crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in London\n\nPolicing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police (\"The Met\"), overseen by the mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).[121] The Met is also referred to as Scotland Yard after the location of its original headquarters in a road called Great Scotland Yard in Whitehall. The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police.[122] First worn by Met police officers in 1863, the custodian helmet has been called a \"cultural icon\" and a \"symbol of British law enforcement\".[123] Introduced by the Met in 1929, the blue police telephone box (basis for the TARDIS in *Doctor Who*) was once a common sight throughout London and regional cities in the UK.[124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters of MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence service, at the SIS Building. Scenes featuring James Bond (the fictional MI6 agent) have been filmed here.\nThe British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services.[125]\nThe Ministry of Defence Police is a special police force in London, which does not generally become involved with policing the general public.[126] The UK's domestic counter-intelligence service (MI5) is headquartered in Thames House on the north bank of the River Thames, and the foreign intelligence service (MI6) is headquartered in the SIS Building on the south bank.[127]\n\n\nCrime rates vary widely across different areas of London. Crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level.[128] In 2015, there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014.[129]\nRecorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018. Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are involved.[130] However, the murder rate in London is much lower than other major cities around the world.[131]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of London\n\n### Scope[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of London in June 2018\nLondon, also known as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis. The City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing \"London\" to be defined several ways.[132]\n\n\nForty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, in which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.[133] The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some just outside included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.[134]\n\n\nFurther urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt, although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, producing a separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt.[135] Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London,[136] and by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central London area. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about 51°30′26″N 00°07′39″W﻿ / ﻿51.50722°N 0.12750°W﻿ / 51.50722; -0.12750.[137]\n\n\n\n### Status[edit]\n\n\nWithin London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies.[138] The area of Greater London includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire.[139] London's status as the capital of England, and later the United Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed by statute or in written form.[note 5]\n\n\nIts status as a capital was established by constitutional convention, which means its status as *de facto* capital is a part of the UK's uncodified constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation.[142] More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as *London*.[143]\n\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)London from Primrose Hill\nGreater London encompasses a total area of 611 square miles (1,583 km2) an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 11,760 inhabitants per square mile (4,542/km2). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 3,236 square miles (8,382 km2) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 3,900 inhabitants per square mile (1,510/km2).[144]\n\n\nModern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a flood plain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically London grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.[145]\n\n\nSince the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.[146] The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level caused by climate change and by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles as a result of post-glacial rebound.[147]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of London\n\n\n\n| London, England\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 59\n\n\n\n8\n\n3\n | 45\n\n\n\n9\n\n3\n | 39\n\n\n\n12\n\n4\n | 42\n\n\n\n15\n\n6\n | 46\n\n\n\n18\n\n9\n | 47\n\n\n\n22\n\n12\n | 46\n\n\n\n24\n\n14\n | 53\n\n\n\n23\n\n14\n | 50\n\n\n\n20\n\n12\n | 65\n\n\n\n16\n\n9\n | 67\n\n\n\n11\n\n5\n | 57\n\n\n\n9\n\n3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 2.3\n\n\n\n47\n\n37\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n48\n\n37\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n53\n\n39\n | 1.7\n\n\n\n59\n\n43\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n65\n\n48\n | 1.9\n\n\n\n71\n\n54\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n75\n\n58\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n57\n | 2\n\n\n\n68\n\n53\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n60\n\n48\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n53\n\n41\n | 2.2\n\n\n\n48\n\n38\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nLondon has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: *Cfb*). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is 7.4 inches (189 mm) in November 1755 and the least is 0 inches (0 mm) in both December 1788 and July 1800. Mile End also had 0 inches (0 mm) in April 1893.[148] The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of 38.1 inches (969 mm) and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of 12.1 inches (308 mm).[149] The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600 mm, which is half the annual rainfall of New York City.[150] Despite its relatively low annual precipitation, London still receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0 mm threshold annually. However, London is vulnerable to climate change in the United Kingdom, and there is increasing concern among hydrological experts that London households may run out of water before 2050.[151]\n\n\nTemperature extremes in London range from 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) at Heathrow on 19 July 2022 down to −17.4 °C (0.7 °F) at Northolt on 13 December 1981.[152][153] Records for atmospheric pressure have been kept at London since 1692. The highest pressure ever reported is 1,049.8 millibars (31.00 inHg) on 20 January 2020.[154]\n\n\nSummers are generally warm, sometimes hot. London's average July high is 23.5 °C (74.3 °F). On average each year, London experiences 31 days above 25 °C (77.0 °F) and 4.2 days above 30.0 °C (86.0 °F). During the 2003 European heat wave, prolonged heat led to hundreds of heat-related deaths.[155] A previous spell of 15 consecutive days above 32.2 °C (90.0 °F) in England in 1976 also caused many heat related deaths.[156] A previous temperature of 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) in August 1911 at the Greenwich station was later disregarded as non-standard.[157] Droughts can also, occasionally, be a problem, especially in summer, most recently in summer 2018, and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December.[158] However, the most consecutive days without rain was 73 days in the spring of 1893.[159]\n\n\nWinters are generally cool with little temperature variation. Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter. Spring and autumn can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect,[160] making the centre of London at times 5 °C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts.[161]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for London (LHR),[note 6] elevation: 25 m (82 ft), 1991–2020 normals\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 40.2(104.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 35.0(95.0)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n | 40.2(104.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 7.9(46.2)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 19.0(66.2)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.7(36.9)\n | 2.7(36.9)\n | 4.1(39.4)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 5.3(41.5)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −16.1(3.0)\n | −13.9(7.0)\n | −8.9(16.0)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −0.6(30.9)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 1.4(34.5)\n | −5.5(22.1)\n | −7.1(19.2)\n | −17.4(0.7)\n | −17.4(0.7)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 58.8(2.31)\n | 45.0(1.77)\n | 38.8(1.53)\n | 42.3(1.67)\n | 45.9(1.81)\n | 47.3(1.86)\n | 45.8(1.80)\n | 52.8(2.08)\n | 49.6(1.95)\n | 65.1(2.56)\n | 66.6(2.62)\n | 57.1(2.25)\n | 615.0(24.21)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 11.5\n | 9.5\n | 8.5\n | 8.8\n | 8.0\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.4\n | 7.9\n | 10.8\n | 11.2\n | 10.8\n | 111.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 80\n | 77\n | 70\n | 65\n | 67\n | 65\n | 65\n | 69\n | 73\n | 78\n | 81\n | 81\n | 73\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 3(37)\n | 2(36)\n | 2(36)\n | 4(39)\n | 7(45)\n | 10(50)\n | 12(54)\n | 12(54)\n | 10(50)\n | 9(48)\n | 6(43)\n | 3(37)\n | 7(44)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 61.1\n | 78.8\n | 124.5\n | 176.7\n | 207.5\n | 208.4\n | 217.8\n | 202.1\n | 157.1\n | 115.2\n | 70.7\n | 55.0\n | 1,674.8\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 23\n | 28\n | 31\n | 40\n | 41\n | 41\n | 42\n | 45\n | 40\n | 35\n | 27\n | 21\n | 35\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 3\n |\n| Source 1: Met Office[162][163][164] Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute[165][166] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (percent sunshine and UV Index)[167] CEDA Archive[168] TORRO[169] Time and Date[170]\nSee Climate of London for additional climate information.\n |\n\n1. **^** London is not a city in the usual UK sense of having city status granted by the Crown.\n2. **^** See also: Independent city § National capitals\n3. **^** The Greater London Authority consists of the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.

These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)The West End theatre district in 2016\nSuch names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965, Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.[172] The City of London is the main financial district,[173] and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.\n\n\nThe West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists.[174] West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.[175] The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London.[176][177]\n\n\nThe East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London.[178] The surrounding East London area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.[178]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Architecture of London, List of tallest buildings and structures in London, and List of demolished buildings and structures in London\n\n![](image)The Tower of London, a medieval castle, dating in part to 1078\nLondon's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace.[179]\n\n\nPart of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by Christopher Wren, neoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey courthouse and the 1960s Barbican Estate. The 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington.[180] The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area and Canary Wharf, high residential densities in inner London, and lower densities in Outer London.\n\n\n\n![](image)The east wing public façade of Buckingham Palace was built between 1847 and 1850; it was remodelled to its present form in 1913.\n![](image)Trafalgar Square and its fountains, with Nelson's Column on the right\nThe Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column (built to commemorate Admiral Horatio Nelson) is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick, commonly the yellow London stock brick.[181]\n\n\nIn the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe (dubbed \"The Gherkin\"), Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings.[182] This protective policy, known as 'St Paul's Heights', has been in operation by the City of London since 1937.[182] Nevertheless, there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central London, including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the United Kingdom and Western Europe.[183]\n\n\nOther notable modern buildings include The Scalpel, 20 Fenchurch Street (dubbed \"The Walkie-Talkie\"), the former City Hall in Southwark, the Art Deco BBC Broadcasting House plus the Postmodernist British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross and No 1 Poultry by James Stirling. The BT Tower stands at 620 feet (189 m) and has a 360 degree coloured LED screen near the top. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the O2 Arena.[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Houses of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) on the right foreground, the London Eye on the left foreground and The Shard with Canary Wharf in the background; seen in September 2014\n\n### Natural history[edit]\n\n\nThe London Natural History Society suggests that London is \"one of the World's Greenest Cities\" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish.[185] They state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves.[186]\n\n\nAmphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, barred grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)A fox on Ayres Street, Southwark, South London\nAmong other inhabitants of London are 10,000 red foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (6 per square kilometre) of London. Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehog, brown rat, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and grey squirrel.[188] In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, a wide variety of mammals are found, including European hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to red fox, grey squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city.[189] Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, Nathusius' and common pipistrelles, common noctule, serotine, barbastelle, Daubenton's, brown long-eared, Natterer's and Leisler's.[190]\n\n\nHerds of red and fallow deer roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained.[191] Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.[192]\n\n\n\n## Demography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demography of London\n\n\n\n2021 Census - Population of London by country of birth[193]\n| Country of Birth | Population | Percent\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 5,223,986 | 59.4\n |\n| Non-United Kingdom | 3,575,739 | 40.6\n |\n|  | ![](image) India | 322,644 | 3.7\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | 175,991 | 2.0\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | 149,397 | 1.7\n |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh | 138,895 | 1.6\n |\n| ![](image) Pakistan | 129,774 | 1.5\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 126,059 | 1.4\n |\n| ![](image) Nigeria | 117,145 | 1.3\n |\n| ![](image) Ireland | 96,566 | 1.1\n |\n| ![](image) Sri Lanka | 80,379 | 0.9\n |\n| ![](image) France | 77,715 | 0.9\n |\n| Others | 2,161,174 | 24.6\n |\n| Total | 8,799,725 | 100.0\n |\n\n\n![](image)Population density map\nThe 2021 census recorded that 3,575,739 people or 40.6% of London's population were foreign-born,[194] making it among the cities with the largest immigrant population in terms of absolute numbers. About 69% of children born in London in 2015 had at least one parent who was born abroad.[195]\n\n\nThe population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter.[196] London's continuous urban area extends beyond Greater London and numbered 9,787,426 people in 2011,[29] while its wider metropolitan area had a population of 12–14 million, depending on the definition used.[197] According to Eurostat, London is the second most populous metropolitan area in Europe. A net 726,000 immigrants arrived there in the period 1991–2001.[198]\n\n\nThe region covers 610 square miles (1,579 km2), giving a population density of 13,410 inhabitants per square mile (5,177/km2)[144] more than ten times that of any other British region.[199] In population terms, London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region.[200]\n\n\n\n### Age structure and median age[edit]\n\n\nChildren younger than 14 constituted 20.6% of the population in Outer London in 2018, and 18% in Inner London. The 15–24 age group was 11.1% in Outer and 10.2% in Inner London, those aged 25–44 years 30.6% in Outer London and 39.7% in Inner London, those aged 45–64 years 24% and 20.7% in Outer and Inner London respectively. Those aged 65 and over are 13.6% in Outer London, but only 9.3% in Inner London.[201]\n\n\nThe median age of London's residents in 2018 was 36.5, which was younger than the UK median of 40.3.[201]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in London\n\nMaps of Greater London showing percentage distribution of selected ethnic groups according to the 2021 Census\n![White](image)\nWhite (53.8%)\n![Asian](image)\nAsian (20.8%)\n![Black](image)\nBlack (13.5%)\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, based on 2011 Census estimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 44.9% White British, 2.2% White Irish, 0.1% gypsy/Irish traveller and 12.1% classified as Other White.[202] Meanwhile, 20.9% of Londoners were of Asian or mixed-Asian descent, with 19.7% being of full Asian descents and 1.2% being of mixed-Asian heritage. Indians accounted for 6.6% of the population, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2.7% each. Chinese people accounted for 1.5%, and Arabs for 1.3%. A further 4.9% were classified as \"Other Asian\".[202]\n\n\n15.6% of London's population were of Black or mixed-Black descent. 13.3% were of full Black descent, with persons of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.3%. Black Africans accounted for 7.0% of London's population; 4.2% identified as Black Caribbean, and 2.1% as \"Other Black\". 5.0% were of mixed race.[202] The history of African presence extends back to the Roman period.[203]\n\n\nAs of 2007, one fifth of primary school students across London were from ethnic minorities.[204] Altogether at the 2011 census, of London's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4% were White, 19.8% Asian, 19% Black, 10.8% Mixed and 4% another ethnic group.[205] In January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that more than 300 languages were spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities had populations of more than 10,000.[206] Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that in 2021[update], London's foreign-born population was 3,346,000 (35%), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.[207]\n\n\nThe 2011 census showed that 36.7% of Greater London's population were born outside the UK.[208] Estimates by the Office for National Statistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in London from July 2009 to June 2010 were born in India, Poland, Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.[209] In the 2021 census 40.6% of London residents were foreign-born.[194] The ethnic demographics of the 2021 census were reported as 53.8% White, with White British reported at 36.8%, Asian or Asian British at 20.8%, Black or Black British at 13.5%, mixed 5.7% and other at 6.3%.[210]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in London\n\nSee also: List of churches in London\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, the largest religious groupings were Christians (48.4%), followed by those of no religion (20.7%), Muslims (12.4%), no response (8.5%), Hindus (5.0%), Jews (1.8%), Sikhs (1.5%), Buddhists (1.0%) and other (0.6%).[211]\n\n\nLondon has traditionally been Christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul's Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres,[212] while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth.[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSt Paul's Cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of London\n![](image)\nThe BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London is the second-largest Hindu temple in England and Europe.\n\nImportant national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey.[214] The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales.[215] Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is low within the denomination. Anglican Church attendance continues a long, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.[216]\n\n\nNotable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, which is allowed to give the Islamic call to prayer through loudspeakers, the London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park[217] and the Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. After the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Middle-Eastern Arab Muslims based themselves around Mayfair, Kensington and Knightsbridge in West London.[218][219][220] There are large Bengali Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.[221]\n\n\nLarge Hindu communities are found in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter hosting what was until 2006[222] Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple.[223] London is home to 44 Hindu temples, including the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.[224]\n\n\nThe majority of British Jews live in London, with notable Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley, Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware, all in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London is affiliated to London's historic Sephardic Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe to have held regular services continually for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any Orthodox synagogue in Europe.[225] The London Jewish Forum was set up in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.[226]\n\n\n\n### Accents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Traditionally, anyone born within earshot of the bells of St Mary-le-Bow church was considered to be a true Cockney.[227]\nCockney is an accent heard across London, mainly spoken by working-class and lower-middle class Londoners. It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East London, having originated there in the 18th century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older.[228] Some features of Cockney include, *Th*-fronting (pronouncing \"th\" as \"f\"), \"th\" inside a word is pronounced with a \"v\", *H*-dropping, and, like most English accents, a Cockney accent drops the \"r\" after a vowel.[229] John Camden Hotten, in his *Slang Dictionary* of 1859, makes reference to Cockney \"use of a peculiar slang language\" (Cockney rhyming slang) when describing the costermongers of the East End. Since the start of the 21st century the extreme form of the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties.[230]\n\n\nEstuary English is an intermediate accent between Cockney and Received Pronunciation.[231] It is widely spoken by people of all classes.[232]\n\n\nMulticultural London English (MLE) is a multiethnolect becoming increasingly common in multicultural areas amongst young, working-class people from diverse backgrounds. It is a fusion of an array of ethnic accents, in particular Afro-Caribbean and South Asian, with a significant Cockney influence.[233]\n\n\nReceived Pronunciation (RP) is the accent traditionally regarded as the standard for British English.[234] It has no specific geographical correlate,[235] although it is also traditionally defined as the standard speech used in London and south-eastern England.[236] It is mainly spoken by upper-class and upper-middle class Londoners.[237]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of London\n\n![](image)The City of London, one of the largest financial centres in the world[238]\nLondon's gross regional product in 2019 was £503 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP.[239] London has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world.[240] London is the world's most expensive office market according to world property journal (2015) report.[241] As of 2015[update] the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion.[242] The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics.[243] On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities.[244]\n\n\n\n### City of London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The London Stock Exchange at Paternoster Square and Temple Bar\n![](image)The Royal Exchange in 1886\nLondon's finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major business districts. London is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance.[245] London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. Also, London's market-centred system (as opposed to the bank-centred one in Amsterdam) grew more dominant in the 18th century.[72] The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time.[76] This economic strength of the city was attributed to its diversity.[246][247]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bank of England, established in 1694, is the model on which most modern central banks are based.\nBy the mid-19th century, London was the leading financial centre, and at the end of the century over half the world's trade was financed in British currency.[248] Still, as of 2016[update] London tops the world rankings on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI),[249] and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney's 2018 Global Cities Index.[250]\n\n\nLondon's largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 per cent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS.[251] Over 85 per cent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London's economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. However, by 2010 the city had recovered, put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London's economic dominance.[252] Along with professional services headquarters, the City of London is home to the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd's of London insurance market.[253]\n\n\nOver half the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London.[254] In a 1992 report commissioned by the London Stock Exchange, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of his family's confectionery company Cadbury, produced the Cadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world.[255]\n\n\n\n### Media and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in London\n\n![](image)Broadcasting House in central London, headquarters of the BBC\nMedia companies are concentrated in London, and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector.[256] The BBC, the world's oldest national broadcaster, is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city. Many national newspapers, including *The Times*, founded in 1785, are edited in London; the term Fleet Street (where most national newspapers operated) remains a metonym for the British national press. London is one of the world's largest retail destinations, with the city frequently ranking at or near the top of retail sales of any city.[257][258] In 2017 it was ranked the top city for luxury store openings.[259] The Port of London is the second largest in the UK, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.[260]\n\n\nA growing number of technology companies are based in London, notably in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In 2014 the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD.[261] In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future in the 2014/15 list by *fDi Intelligence*.[262] A museum in Bletchley Park, where Alan Turing was based during World War II, is in Bletchley, 40 miles (64 km) north of central London, as is The National Museum of Computing.[263]\n\n\nThe gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN[264] and UK Power Networks.[265]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in London\n\n![](image)\nThe British Museum\n![](image)\nThe National Gallery\n\nLondon is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits.[266] It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015.[267] Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing 700,000 full-time workers in 2016, and contributes £36 billion a year to the economy.[268] The city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK.[269] As of 2016[update] London was the world top city destination as ranked by TripAdvisor users.[270]\n\n\nIn 2015 the top most-visited attractions in the UK were all in London. The top 10 most visited attractions were: (with visits per venue)[271]\n\n\n\n1. British Museum: 6,820,686\n2. National Gallery: 5,908,254\n3. Natural History Museum (South Kensington): 5,284,023\n4. Southbank Centre: 5,102,883\n5. Tate Modern: 4,712,581\n6. Victoria and Albert Museum (South Kensington): 3,432,325\n7. Science Museum: 3,356,212\n8. Somerset House: 3,235,104\n9. Tower of London: 2,785,249\n10. National Portrait Gallery: 2,145,486\n\n\nThe number of hotel rooms in London in 2015 stood at 138,769, and is expected to grow over the years.[272]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in London and Infrastructure in London\n\nTransport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,[273] but the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer-distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL).[109]\n\n\nThe lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board or *London Transport* was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.[274]\n\n\n\n### Aviation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Airports of London\n\n![](image)Heathrow Airport is the busiest airport in Europe as well as the second busiest in the world for international passenger traffic (Terminal 5C is pictured).\nLondon is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word *London* in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights.\n\n\n\n* Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, was for many years the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways.[275] In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened.[276]\n* Gatwick Airport, south of London in West Sussex, handles flights to more destinations than any other UK airport and is the main base of easyJet, the UK's largest airline by number of passengers.[277]\n* Stansted Airport, north-east of London in Essex, has flights that serve the greatest number of European destinations of any UK airport and is the main base of Ryanair, the world's largest international airline by number of international passengers.[278]\n* Luton Airport, to the north of London in Bedfordshire, is used by several budget airlines (especially easyJet and Wizz Air) for short-haul flights.[279]\n* London City Airport, the most central airport and the one with the shortest runway, in Newham, East London, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full-service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.[280]\n* Southend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller, regional airport that caters for short-haul flights on a limited, though growing, number of airlines.[281] In 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend, the highest proportion of any London airport.[282]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n#### Underground and DLR[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The London Underground is the world's oldest and third-longest rapid transit system.\nOpened in 1863, the London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world.[283][284] The system serves 272 stations, and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway, which opened in 1890.[285]\n\n\nOver four million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year.[286] An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics.[287] The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Suburban[edit]\n\n\nThere are 368 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports.[289] London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers—Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year.[290] Clapham Junction is one of Europe's busiest rail interchanges.[291]\n\n\nWith the need for more rail capacity, the Elizabeth Line (also known as Crossrail) opened in May 2022.[292] It is a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport.[293] It was Europe's biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost.[294]\n\n\n\n#### Inter-city and international[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St Pancras International is the main terminal for high-speed Eurostar and High Speed 1 services, as well as commuter suburban Thameslink and inter-city East Midlands Railway services.\nLondon is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 per cent of rail journeys starting or ending in London.[295] King's Cross station and Euston station, both in London, are the starting points of the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line – the two main railway lines in Britain. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, directly linking London with most of Great Britain's major cities and towns.[296] *The Flying Scotsman* is an express passenger train service that has operated between London and Edinburgh since 1862; the world famous steam locomotive named after this service, *Flying Scotsman*, was the first locomotive to reach the officially authenticated speed of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h) in 1934.[297]\n\n\nSome international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Calais, Paris, Disneyland Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel.[298] The first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London.[299] There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.[300]\n\n\n\n### Buses, coaches and trams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A New Routemaster (which replaced the AEC Routemaster) entered service in 2012. The red double-decker bus is an emblematic symbol of London.\nLondon's bus network runs 24 hours a day with about 9,300 vehicles, over 675 bus routes and about 19,000 bus stops.[301] In 2019 the network had over 2 billion commuter trips per year.[302] Since 2010 an average of £1.2 billion is taken in revenue each year.[303] London has one of the largest wheelchair-accessible networks in the world[304] and from the third quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced.[305]\n\n\nLondon's coach hub is Victoria Coach Station, opened in 1932. Nationalised in 1970 and subsequently purchased by London Transport which then became Transport for London, Victoria Coach Station has over 14 million passengers a year and provides services across the UK and continental Europe.[306]\n\n\nLondon has a modern tram network, known as Tramlink. It has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013.[307] Since June 2008, Transport for London has completely owned and operated Tramlink.[308]\n\n\n\n### Cable car[edit]\n\n\nLondon's first and to date only cable car is the London Cable Car, which opened in June 2012. The cable car crosses the Thames and links Greenwich Peninsula with the Royal Docks in the east of the city. It is able to carry up to 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times.[309]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cycling in London\n\n![](image)Santander Cycle Hire, near Victoria in Central London\nIn the Greater London Area, around 670,000 people use a bike every day,[310] meaning around 7% of the total population of around 8.8 million use a bike on an average day.[311] Cycling has become an increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of a bicycle hire scheme in July 2010 was successful and generally well received.[312]\n\n\n\n### Port and river boats[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of London, once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009.[260] Most of this cargo passes through the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London.[260]\n\n\nLondon has river boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers, which offer both commuter and tourist boat services.[313] At major piers including Canary Wharf, London Bridge City, Battersea Power Station and London Eye (Waterloo), services depart at least every 20 minutes during commuter times.[314] The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads.[315]\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at 117 miles (188 km) long.[316] The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh.[317]\n\n\n\n![](image)The hackney carriage (black cab) is a common sight on London streets. Although traditionally black, this is not a requirement with some painted in other colours or bearing advertising.\nThe Austin Motor Company began making hackney carriages (London taxis) in 1929, and models include Austin FX3 from 1948, Austin FX4 from 1958, with more recent models TXII and TX4 manufactured by London Taxis International. The BBC states, \"ubiquitous black cabs and red double-decker buses all have long and tangled stories that are deeply embedded in London's traditions\".[318]\n\n\nLondon is notorious for its traffic congestion; in 2009, the average speed of a car in the rush hour was recorded at 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).[319] In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London.[320] Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass.[321] Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars.[322]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in London\n\n### Tertiary education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of universities and higher education colleges in London\n\n![](image)University College London (UCL), established by Royal Charter in 1836, is one of the founding colleges of the University of London.\n![](image)Imperial College London, a technical research university in South Kensington\nLondon is a major global centre of higher education teaching and research and has the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.[19] According to the QS World University Rankings 2015/16, London has the greatest concentration of top class universities in the world[323] and its international student population of around 110,000 is larger than any other city in the world.[324] A 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers report termed London the global capital of higher education.[325]\nA number of world-leading education institutions are based in London. In the 2022 *QS World University Rankings*, Imperial College London is ranked No. 6 in the world, University College London (UCL) is ranked 8th, and King's College London (KCL) is ranked 37th.[326] All are regularly ranked highly, with Imperial College being the UK's leading university in the Research Excellence Framework ranking 2021.[327] The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research.[328] The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2015 its MBA programme was ranked second-best in the world by the *Financial Times*.[329] The city is also home to three of the world's top ten performing arts schools (as ranked by the 2020 QS World University Rankings[330]): the Royal College of Music (ranking 2nd in the world), the Royal Academy of Music (ranking 4th) and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (ranking 6th).[331]\n\n\nWith students in London and around 48,000 in University of London Worldwide,[332] the federal University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the UK.[333] It includes five multi-faculty universities – City, King's College London, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway and UCL – and a number of smaller and more specialised institutions including Birkbeck, the Courtauld Institute of Art, Goldsmiths, the London Business School, the London School of Economics, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Royal Academy of Music, the Central School of Speech and Drama, the Royal Veterinary College and the School of Oriental and African Studies.[334]\n\n\nUniversities in London outside the University of London system include Brunel University, Imperial College London,[note 1] Kingston University, London Metropolitan University, University of East London, University of West London, University of Westminster, London South Bank University, Middlesex University, and University of the Arts London (the largest university of art, design, fashion, communication and the performing arts in Europe).[335] In addition, there are three international universities – Regent's University London, Richmond, The American International University in London and Schiller International University.\n\n\nLondon is home to five major medical schools – Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry (part of Queen Mary), King's College London School of Medicine (the largest medical school in Europe), Imperial College School of Medicine, UCL Medical School and St George's, University of London – and has many affiliated teaching hospitals. It is also a major centre for biomedical research, and three of the UK's eight academic health science centres are based in the city – Imperial College Healthcare, King's Health Partners and UCL Partners (the largest such centre in Europe).[336] Additionally, many biomedical and biotechnology spin out companies from these research institutions are based around the city, most prominently in White City. Founded by pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale at St Thomas' Hospital in 1860, the first nursing school is now part of King's College London.[337] It was at King's in 1952 where a team led by Rosalind Franklin captured *Photo 51*, the critical evidence in identifying the structure of DNA.[338] There are a number of business schools in London, including the London School of Business and Finance, Cass Business School (part of City University London), Hult International Business School, ESCP Europe, European Business School London, Imperial College Business School, the London Business School and the UCL School of Management.\n\n\n\n![](image)Opened in 1906, the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama is a member of Conservatoires UK and the Federation of Drama Schools.\nLondon is also home to many specialist arts education institutions, including the Central School of Ballet, London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), London College of Contemporary Arts (LCCA), London Contemporary Dance School, National Centre for Circus Arts, Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA; president Sir Kenneth Branagh), Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance, the Royal College of Art, Sylvia Young Theatre School and Trinity Laban. The BRIT School in the London borough of Croydon provides training for the performing arts and technologies.[339]\n\n\n\n### Primary and secondary education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Centre for School Design\n\nThe majority of primary and secondary schools and further-education colleges in London are controlled by the London boroughs or otherwise state-funded; leading examples include Ashbourne College, Bethnal Green Academy, Brampton Manor Academy, City and Islington College, City of Westminster College, David Game College, Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, Leyton Sixth Form College, London Academy of Excellence, Tower Hamlets College, and Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre. There are also a number of private schools and colleges in London, some old and famous, such as City of London School, Harrow, St Paul's School, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, University College School, The John Lyon School, Highgate School and Westminster School.\n\n\n\n### Royal Observatory, Greenwich and learned societies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tourists queuing to take pictures on the line of the historic prime meridian at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The observatory has played a major role in the history of navigation and astronomy.\nFounded in 1675, the Royal Observatory in Greenwich was established to address the problem of calculating longitude for navigational purposes. This pioneering work in solving longitude featured in astronomer royal Nevil Maskelyne's *Nautical Almanac* which made the Greenwich meridian the universal reference point, and helped lead to the international adoption of Greenwich as the prime meridian (0° longitude) in 1884.[340]\n\n\nImportant scientific learned societies based in London include the Royal Society—the UK's national academy of sciences and the oldest national scientific institution in the world—founded in 1660,[341] and the Royal Institution, founded in 1799. Since 1825, the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures have presented scientific subjects to a general audience, and speakers have included aerospace engineer Frank Whittle, naturalist David Attenborough and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.[342]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of London\n\n### Leisure and entertainment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of annual events in London and West End theatre\n\nLeisure is a major part of the London economy. A 2003 report attributed a quarter of the entire UK leisure economy to London[343] at 25.6 events per 1000 people.[344] The city is one of the four fashion capitals of the world, and, according to official statistics, is the world's third-busiest film production centre, presents more live comedy than any other city,[345] and has the biggest theatre audience of any city in the world.[346]\n\n\n\n![](image)Harrods department store in Knightsbridge\nWithin the City of Westminster in London, the entertainment district of the West End has its focus around Leicester Square, where London and world film premieres are held, and Piccadilly Circus, with its giant electronic advertisements.[347] London's theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs, and restaurants, including the city's Chinatown district (in Soho), and just to the east is Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops. The city is the home of Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have dominated West End theatre since the late 20th century.[348] Agatha Christie's *The Mousetrap*, the world's longest-running play, has been performed in the West End since 1952.[349] The Laurence Olivier Awards–named after Laurence Olivier–are given annually by the Society of London Theatre. The Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Royal Opera, and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House, the London Coliseum, Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the Royal Albert Hall, as well as touring the country.[350]\n\n\nIslington's 1 mile (1.6 km) long Upper Street, extending northwards from Angel, has more bars and restaurants than any other street in the UK.[351] Europe's busiest shopping area is Oxford Street, a shopping street nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) long, making it the longest shopping street in the UK. It is home to vast numbers of retailers and department stores, including Selfridges flagship store.[352] Knightsbridge, home to the equally renowned Harrods department store, lies to the south-west. Opened in 1760 with its flagship store on Regent Street since 1881, Hamleys is the oldest toy store in the world.[353] Madame Tussauds wax museum opened in Baker Street in 1835, an era viewed as being when London's tourism industry began.[354]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scene of the annual Notting Hill Carnival, 2014\nLondon is home to designers John Galliano, Stella McCartney, Manolo Blahnik, and Jimmy Choo, among others; its renowned art and fashion schools make it one of the four international centres of fashion. Mary Quant designed the miniskirt in her King's Road boutique in Swinging Sixties London.[355] London offers a great variety of cuisine as a result of its ethnically diverse population. Gastronomic centres include the Bangladeshi restaurants of Brick Lane and the Chinese restaurants of Chinatown.[356] There are Chinese takeaways throughout London, as are Indian restaurants which provide Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine.[357] Around 1860, the first fish and chips shop in London was opened by Joseph Malin, a Jewish immigrant, in Bow.[318][358] The full English breakfast dates from the Victorian era, and many cafes in London serve a full English breakfast throughout the day.[359] London has five 3-Michelin star restaurants, including Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea.[360] Many hotels in London provide a traditional afternoon tea service, such as the Oscar Wilde Lounge at the Hotel Café Royal in Piccadilly, and a themed tea service is also available, for example an *Alice in Wonderland* themed afternoon tea served at the Egerton House Hotel, and *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* themed afternoon tea at One Aldwych in Covent Garden.[361][362] The nation's most popular biscuit to dunk in tea, chocolate digestives have been manufactured by McVitie's at their Harlesden factory in north-west London since 1925.[363]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shakespeare's Globe is a modern reconstruction of the Globe Theatre on the south bank of the Thames.\nThere is a variety of annual events, beginning with the relatively new New Year's Day Parade, a fireworks display at the London Eye; the world's second largest street party, the Notting Hill Carnival, is held on the late August Bank Holiday each year. Traditional parades include November's Lord Mayor's Show, a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the city, and June's Trooping the Colour, a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen's Official Birthday.[364] The Boishakhi Mela is a Bengali New Year festival celebrated by the British Bangladeshi community. It is the largest open-air Asian festival in Europe. After the Notting Hill Carnival, it is the second-largest street festival in the United Kingdom attracting over 80,000 visitors.[365] First held in 1862, the RHS Chelsea Flower Show (run by the Royal Horticultural Society) takes place in May every year.[366]\n\n\n\n### LGBT scene[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LGBT culture in London\n\nThe first gay bar in London in the modern sense was The Cave of the Golden Calf, established as a night club in an underground location at 9 Heddon Street, just off Regent Street, in 1912 and \"which developed a reputation for sexual freedom and tolerance of same-sex relations.\"[367]\n\n\n\n![](image)Comptons of Soho during London Pride in 2010\nWhile London has been an LGBT tourism destination, after homosexuality was decriminalised in England in 1967 gay bar culture became more visible, and from the early 1970s Soho (and in particular Old Compton Street) became the centre of the London LGBT community.[368] G-A-Y, previously based at the Astoria, and now Heaven, is a long-running night club.[369]\n\n\nWider British cultural movements have influenced LGBT culture: for example, the emergence of glam rock in the UK in the early 1970s, via Marc Bolan and David Bowie, saw a generation of teenagers begin playing with the idea of androgyny, and the West End musical *The Rocky Horror Show*, which debuted in London in 1973, is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements.[370] The Blitz Kids (which included Boy George) frequented the Tuesday club-night at Blitz in Covent Garden, helping launch the New Romantic subcultural movement in the late 1970s.[371] Today, the annual London Pride Parade and the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival are held in the city.[368]\n\n\n\n### Literature, film and television[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: London in fiction, London in film, List of television shows set in London, and London Television Archive\n\n![](image)Sherlock Holmes Museum in Baker Street, bearing the number 221B\nLondon has been the setting for many works of literature. The pilgrims in Geoffrey Chaucer's late 14th-century *Canterbury Tales* set out for Canterbury from London. William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based there, and some of his work, most notably his play *The Alchemist*, was set in the city.[372] *A Journal of the Plague Year* (1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague.[372]\n\n\nThe literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire; Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has influenced people's vision of early Victorian London; and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.[372] Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.[372] Robert Louis Stevenson mixed in London literary circles, and in 1886 he wrote the *Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*, a gothic novella set in Victorian London.[373] In 1898, H. G. Wells' sci-fi novel *The War of the Worlds* sees London (and the south of England) invaded by Martians.[374] Letitia Elizabeth Landon wrote *Calendar of the London Seasons* in 1834. Modern writers influenced by the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of a \"biography\" of London, and Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography. In the 1940s, George Orwell wrote essays in the *London Evening Standard*, most notably \"A Nice Cup of Tea\" (method for making tea) and \"The Moon Under Water\" (an ideal pub).[375] The WWII evacuation of children from London is depicted in C.

The largest cinema chain in the country, Odeon Cinemas was founded in London in 1928 by Oscar Deutsch.[382] The British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) have been held in London since 1949, with the BAFTA Fellowship the Academy's highest accolade.[383] Founded in 1957, the BFI London Film Festival takes place over two weeks every October.[384]\n\n\nLondon is a major centre for television production, with studios including Television Centre, ITV Studios, Sky Campus and Fountain Studios; the latter hosted the original talent shows, *Pop Idol*, *The X Factor*, and *Britain's Got Talent*, before each format was exported around the world.[385][386] Formerly a franchise of ITV, Thames Television featured comedians such as Benny Hill and Rowan Atkinson (*Mr. Bean* was first screened by Thames), while Talkback produced *Da Ali G Show* which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as Ali G.[387] Many television shows have been set in London, including the popular television soap opera *EastEnders*.[388]\n\n\n\n### Museums, art galleries and libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Albertopolis. The Albert Memorial, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Geographical Society, and Royal College of Art are visible near the top; Victoria and Albert Museum and Natural History Museum at the lower end; Imperial College, Royal College of Music, and Science Museum lying in between.\nLondon is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753.[389] Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824, the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square.[390]\n\n\nThe British Library is the second largest library in the world, and the national library of the United Kingdom.[391] There are many other research libraries, including the Wellcome Library and Dana Centre, as well as university libraries, including the British Library of Political and Economic Science at LSE, the Abdus Salam Library at Imperial, the Maughan Library at King's, and the Senate House Libraries at the University of London.[392]\n\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as \"Albertopolis\", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits.[393] The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art. In 2000, this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station which is accessed by pedestrians north of the Thames via the Millennium Bridge.[394]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Royal Albert Hall hosts concerts and musical events, including The Proms which are held every summer, as well as cinema screenings of films accompanied with live orchestral music.\nLondon is one of the major classical and popular music capitals of the world and hosts major music corporations, such as Universal Music Group International and Warner Music Group, and countless bands, musicians and industry professionals. The city is also home to many orchestras and concert halls, such as the Barbican Arts Centre (principal base of the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus), the Southbank Centre (London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra), Cadogan Hall (Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) and the Royal Albert Hall (The Proms).[350] The Proms, an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music first held in 1895, ends with the Last Night of the Proms. London's two main opera houses are the Royal Opera House and the London Coliseum (home to the English National Opera).[350] The UK's largest pipe organ is at the Royal Albert Hall. Other significant instruments are in cathedrals and major churches—the church bells of St Clement Danes feature in the 1744 nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\".[395] Several conservatoires are within the city: Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity Laban. The record label EMI was formed in the city in 1931, and an early employee for the company, Alan Blumlein, created stereo sound that year.[396]\n\n\n\n![](image)Abbey Road Studios in Abbey Road\nLondon has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts, including the world's busiest indoor venue, the O2 Arena,[397] and Wembley Arena, as well as many mid-sized venues, such as Brixton Academy, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd's Bush Empire.[350] Several music festivals, including the Wireless Festival, Lovebox and Hyde Park's British Summer Time, are held in London.[398]\n\n\nThe city is home to the original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles recorded many of their hits. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, musicians and groups like Elton John, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, Queen, Eric Clapton, the Who, Cliff Richard, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Deep Purple, T. Rex, the Police, Elvis Costello, Dire Straits, Cat Stevens, Fleetwood Mac, the Cure, Madness, Culture Club, Dusty Springfield, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Status Quo and Sade, derived their sound from the streets and rhythms of London.[399][400]\n\n\nLondon was instrumental in the development of punk music, with figures such as the Sex Pistols, the Clash and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood all based in the city.[401][402] Other artists to emerge from the London music scene include George Michael, Kate Bush, Seal, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, the Prodigy, Gorillaz, Mumford & Sons, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Dua Lipa and Florence and the Machine.[403] Artists from London played a prominent role in the development of synth-pop, including Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, the Pet Shop Boys and Eurythmics; the latter's \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" was recorded in the attic of their north London home, heralding a trend for home recording methods.[404] Artists from London with a Caribbean influence include Hot Chocolate, Billy Ocean, Soul II Soul and Eddy Grant, with the latter fusing reggae, soul and samba with rock and pop.[405] London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of house, hip hop, and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and in the rest of the United Kingdom. The British Phonographic Industry's annual popular music awards, the Brit Awards, are held in London.[406]\n\n\n\n## Recreation[edit]\n\n\n### Parks and open spaces[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Parks and open spaces in London and Royal Parks of London\n\nSee also: List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater London and List of local nature reserves in Greater London\n\n![](image)Hyde Park (with Kensington Gardens in foreground) has been a popular public space since it opened in 1637.\nA 2013 report by the City of London Corporation said that London is the \"greenest city\" in Europe with 35,000 acres (14,164 hectares) of public parks, woodlands and gardens.[407] The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the eight Royal Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens in the west, and Regent's Park to the north.[408] Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts. Regent's Park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is near Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.[409] Primrose Hill is a popular spot from which to view the city skyline.[410]\n\n\nClose to Hyde Park are smaller Royal Parks, Green Park and St. James's Park.[411] A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including Hampstead Heath and the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the southeast, and Bushy Park and Richmond Park (the largest) to the southwest. Hampton Court Park is also a royal park, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks.[412]\n\n\nClose to Richmond Park is Kew Gardens, which has the world's largest collection of living plants. In 2003, the gardens were put on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.[413] There are also parks administered by London's borough Councils, including Victoria Park in the East End and Battersea Park in the centre. Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including Hampstead Heath and Epping Forest,[414] both controlled by the City of London Corporation.[415] Hampstead Heath incorporates Kenwood House, a former stately home and a popular location in the summer months when classical musical concerts are held by the lake.[416] Epping Forest is a popular venue for various outdoor activities, including mountain biking, walking, horse riding, golf, angling, and orienteering.[414] Three of the UK's most-visited theme parks, Thorpe Park near Staines-upon-Thames, Chessington World of Adventures in Chessington and Legoland Windsor, are located within 20 miles (32 km) of London.[417]\n\n\n\n### Walking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Horse Ride is a tree tunnel (route overhung by trees) on the western side of Wimbledon Common.\nWalking is a popular recreational activity in London. Areas that provide for walks include Wimbledon Common, Epping Forest, Hampton Court Park, Hampstead Heath, the eight Royal Parks, canals and disused railway tracks.[418] Access to canals and rivers has improved recently, including the creation of the Thames Path, some 28 miles (45 km) of which is within Greater London, and The Wandle Trail along the River Wandle.[419]\n\n\nOther long-distance paths, linking green spaces, have also been created, including the Capital Ring, the Green Chain Walk, London Outer Orbital Path (\"Loop\"), Jubilee Walkway, Lea Valley Walk, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk.[418]\n\n\n\n## Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in London\n\nSee also: Football in London and Rugby union in London\n\n![](image)\nWembley Stadium, home of the England men and women's football team and the FA Cup Final, has a seating capacity of 90,000. It is the UK's biggest stadium.[420]\n![](image)\nCentre Court at Wimbledon. Held every June and July, Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, and the only major played on grass.\n![](image)\nTwickenham, home of the England national rugby union team, has a capacity of 82,000 seats.\n\nLondon has hosted the Summer Olympics three times: in 1908, 1948, and 2012, making it the first city to host the modern Games three times.[34] The city was also the host of the British Empire Games in 1934.[421] In 2017, London hosted the World Championships in Athletics for the first time.[422]\n\n\nLondon's most popular sport is football, and it has seven clubs in the Premier League in the 2022–23 season: Arsenal, Brentford, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur, and West Ham United.[423] Other professional men's teams in London are AFC Wimbledon, Barnet, Bromley, Charlton Athletic, Dagenham & Redbridge, Leyton Orient, Millwall, Queens Park Rangers and Sutton United. Four London-based teams are in the Women's Super League: Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and West Ham United.\n\n\nTwo Premiership Rugby union teams are based in Greater London: Harlequins and Saracens.[424] Ealing Trailfinders and London Scottish play in the RFU Championship; other rugby union clubs in the city include Richmond, Rosslyn Park, Westcombe Park and Blackheath. Twickenham Stadium in south-west London hosts home matches for the England national rugby union team.[425] While rugby league is more popular in the north of England, the sport has one professional club in London – the London Broncos who play in the Super League.\n\n\nOne of London's best-known annual sports competitions is the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, held at the All England Club in the south-western suburb of Wimbledon since 1877.[426] Played in late June to early July, it is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and widely considered the most prestigious.[427][428]\n\n\nLondon has two Test cricket grounds which host the England cricket team, Lord's (home of Middlesex C.C.C.) and the Oval (home of Surrey C.C.C.). Lord's has hosted four finals of the Cricket World Cup and is known as the *Home of Cricket*.[429] In golf, the Wentworth Club is located in Virginia Water, Surrey on the south-west fringes of London, while the closest venue to London that is used as one of the courses for the Open Championship, the oldest major and tournament in golf, is Royal St George's in Sandwich, Kent.[430] Alexandra Palace in north London hosts the PDC World Darts Championship and the Masters snooker tournament. Other key annual events are the mass-participation London Marathon[431] and the University Boat Race.[432]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from London\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)London portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![flag](image)England portal\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n\n\n* Outline of England\n* Outline of London\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** London region (Greater London administrative area)\n\n1. **^** Imperial College London was a constituent college of the University of London between 1908 and 2007.

With over 21 million residents, Beijing is the world's most populous national capital city as well as China's second largest city after Shanghai.[9] It is located in Northern China, and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.[10] Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin to the southeast; together, the three divisions form the Jingjinji megalopolis and the national capital region of China.[11]\n\n\nBeijing is a global city and one of the world's leading centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport, science and technology and transportation. As a megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai.[12] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets.[13] It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[14] and, as of 2016[update], the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world. The Beijing Daxing International Airport, which is the second international airport in Beijing, is the largest single-structure airport terminal in the world.[15][16]\n\n\nCombining both modern and traditional style architectures, Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich history dating back over three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries,[17] and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium CE.[18] With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates.[19] Beijing is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world. In 2018, Beijing was the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[20] Beijing is home to many national monuments and museums and has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites—the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, and parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal—all of which are popular tourist locations.[21] Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing.\n\n\nBeijing's public universities make up more than one-fifth of Double First-Class Universities, and many of them consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world.[22][23][24] Beijing is home to the two best C9 League universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in Asia & Oceania region and emerging countries.[25][26] Beijing CBD is a center for Beijing's economic expansion, with the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers. Beijing's Zhongguancun area is a world leading center of scientific and technological innovation as well as entrepreneurship. Beijing has been ranked the city with the largest scientific research output by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][28] The city has hosted numerous international and national sporting events, the most notable being the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games. In 2022, Beijing became the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics,[29] and also the Summer and Winter Paralympics.[30] Beijing hosts 175 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many organizations, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Silk Road Fund, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, and the Red Cross Society of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Beijing\n\nOver the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had numerous other names. The name *Beijing*, which means \"Northern Capital\" (from the Chinese characters 北 *běi* for *north* and 京 *jīng* for *capital*), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the \"Southern Capital\").[31] The English spelling *Beijing* is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. An older English spelling, *Peking*, was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.[32] Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA code PEK, and Peking University, still retain the former romanization.\n\n\nThe single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is 京, which appears on automobile license plates in the city. The official Latin alphabet abbreviation for Beijing is \"BJ\".[33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Beijing\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest traces of human habitation in the Peking municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. *Homo erectus* fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic *Homo sapiens* also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago.[34] Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in central Peking.\n\n\nThe first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng, the capital city of the state of Ji which was built in 1045 BC. Within modern Beijing, Jicheng was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District.[35] This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital.[36]\n\n\n\n### Early Imperial China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Tianning Pagoda, built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty\nAfter the First Emperor unified China in 221 BC, Jicheng became a prefectural capital and[37] during the Three Kingdoms period, it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to the Wei Kingdom of Cao Cao. The AD third-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu, Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom.[38]\n\n\nAfter China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581, Jicheng, also known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal. Under the Tang dynasty, Jicheng as Youzhou, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the \"Yan Capital.\" Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the frontier territory including what is now Beijing to the Khitan Liao dynasty, which treated the city as Nanjing, or the \"Southern Capital\", one of four secondary capitals to complement its \"Supreme Capital\" Shangjing (modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia). Some of the oldest surviving pagodas in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the Tianning Pagoda.\n\n\nThe Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122, which gave the city to the Song dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China. In 1153, the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their \"Central Capital\", or Zhongdu.[37] The city was besieged by Genghis Khan's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later.[39] Two generations later, Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as Khanbaliq), a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins. The construction took from 1264 to 1293,[37][39][40] but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper. The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present-day Chang'an Avenue to the northern part of Line 10 subway. Remnants of the Yuan rammed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng.[41]\n\n\n\n### Ming dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the corner towers of the Forbidden City, built by the Yongle Emperor during the early Ming dynasty\nIn 1368, soon after declaring the new Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty, the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang captured Dadu/Khanbaliq and razed the Yuan palaces to the ground.[42] Since the Yuan continued to occupy Shangdu and Mongolia, Dadu was used to supply the Ming military garrisons in the area and renamed Beiping (Wade–Giles: Peip'ing, \"Northern Peace\").[43] Under the Hongwu Emperor's feudal policies, Beiping was given to his son Zhu Di, who was created \"Prince of Yan\".\n\n![](image)Overlapping layout of Beijing during the Liao, Jin, Yuan and Ming dynasties\nThe early death of Zhu Yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle upon his death, one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (modern Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital. The city of Beiping became Beijing (\"Northern Capital\") or Shuntian[44] in 1403.[31] The construction of the new imperial residence, the Forbidden City, took from 1406 to 1420;[39] this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven[45] and Tian'anmen. On 28 October 1420, the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed.[46] Beijing became the empire's primary capital, and Yingtian, also called Nanjing (\"Southern Capital\"), became the co-capital. (A 1425 order by Zhu Di's son, the Hongxi Emperor, to return the primary capital to Nanjing was never carried out: he died, probably of a heart attack, the next month. He was buried, like almost every Ming emperor to follow him, in an elaborate necropolis to Beijing's north.)\n\n\nBy the 15th century, Beijing had essentially taken its current shape. The Ming city wall continued to serve until modern times, when it was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place.[47] It is generally believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world for most of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.[48] The first known church was constructed by Catholics in 1652 at the former site of Matteo Ricci's chapel; the modern Nantang Cathedral was later built upon the same site.[49]\n\n\nThe capture of Beijing by Li Zicheng's peasant army in 1644 ended the dynasty, but he and his Shun court abandoned the city without a fight when the Manchu army of Prince Dorgon arrived 40 days later.\n\n\n\n### Qing dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer Palace is one of the several palatial gardens built by Qing emperors in the northwest suburb area.\nDorgon established the Qing dynasty as a direct successor of the Ming (delegitimising Li Zicheng and his followers)[50] and Beijing became China's sole capital.[51] The Qing emperors made some modifications to the Imperial residence but, in large part, the Ming buildings and the general layout remained unchanged. Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced, but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals. Signage was bilingual or Chinese. This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the Chinese novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Northwest of the city, Qing emperors built several large palatial gardens including the Old Summer Palace and the Summer Palace.\n\n\nDuring the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces captured the outskirts of the city, looting and burning the Old Summer Palace in 1860. Under the Convention of Peking[a] ending that war, Western powers for the first time secured the right to establish permanent diplomatic presences within the city. From 14 to 15 August 1900 the Battle of Peking was fought. This battle was part of the Boxer Rebellion. \nThe attempt by the Boxers to eradicate this presence, as well as Chinese Christian converts, led to Beijing's reoccupation by eight foreign powers.[54] During the fighting, several important structures were destroyed, including the Hanlin Academy and the (new) Summer Palace.\nA peace agreement was concluded between the Eight-Nation Alliance and representatives of the Chinese government Li Hongzhang and Yikuang on 7 September 1901. The treaty required China to pay an indemnity of US$335 million (over US$4 billion in current dollars) plus interest over a period of 39 years. Also required was the execution or exile of government supporters of the Boxers and the destruction of Chinese forts and other defenses in much of northern China. Ten days after the treaty was signed the foreign armies left Beijing, although legation guards would remain there until World War II.[55]\n\n\nWith the treaty signed the Empress Dowager Cixi returned to Beijing from her \"tour of inspection\" on 7 January 1902 and the rule of the Qing dynasty over China was restored, albeit much weakened by the defeat it had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and by the indemnity and stipulations of the peace treaty.[56] The Dowager died in 1908 and the dynasty imploded in 1911.\n\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A large portrait of Chiang Kai-shek was displayed above Tiananmen after WWII.\nThe fomenters of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like Sun Yat-sen originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later[57] left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. Following the success of the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, the capital was formally moved to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as \"Peiping\").[12][58]\n\n\nOn 7 July 1937, the 29th Army and the Japanese army in China exchanged fire at the Marco Polo Bridge near the Wanping Fortress southwest of the city. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II as it is known in China. During the war,[12] Beijing fell to Japan on 29 July 1937[59] and was made the seat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state that ruled the ethnic-Chinese portions of Japanese-occupied northern China.[60] This government was later merged into the larger Wang Jingwei government based in Nanjing.[61]\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tiananmen during People's Republic of China\nIn the final phases of the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army seized control of the city peacefully on 31 January 1949 in the course of the Pingjin Campaign. On 1 October that year, Mao Zedong announced the creation of the People's Republic of China from atop Tian'anmen. He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing,[62] a decision that had been reached by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference just a few days earlier.\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in the west and residential neighborhoods in the north. Many areas of the Beijing city wall were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the Beijing Subway and the 2nd Ring Road.\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the Red Guard movement began in Beijing and the city's government fell victim to one of the first purges. By the autumn of 1966, all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tian'anmen Square with Mao.[63] In April 1976, a large public gathering of Beijing residents against the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution in Tiananmen Square was forcefully suppressed. In October 1976, the Gang was arrested in Zhongnanhai and the Cultural Revolution came to an end. In December 1978, the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress in Beijing under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping reversed the verdicts against victims of the Cultural Revolution and instituted the \"policy of reform and opening up.\"\n\n\nSince the early 1980s, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Ring Roads.[64][65] According to one 2005 newspaper report, the size of newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times larger than before.[66] Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing shopping districts,[67] while Zhongguancun has become a major center of electronics in China.[68] In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as heavy traffic, poor air quality, the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed rural areas of the country.[69] Beijing has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.[70] The city has also hosted major international events, including the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.[71]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Beijing\n\nBeijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular North China Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially Yanqing District and Huairou District, are dominated by the Jundu Mountains, while the western part is framed by *Xishan* or the Western Hills. The Great Wall of China across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling, in the Western Hills and on the border with Hebei, is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of 2,303 metres (7,556 ft).\n\n\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the Chaobai, Yongding, Juma, are all tributaries in the Hai River system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the Grand Canal to Hangzhou, which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the South–North Water Transfer Project, constructed in the past decade to bring water from the Yangtze River basin.\n\n\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of 40 to 60 metres (130–200 feet), occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric ring roads. The Second Ring Road traces the old city walls and the Sixth Ring Road connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. Tian'anmen and Tian'anmen Square are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the Forbidden City, the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai, the residence of China's current leaders. Chang'an Avenue, which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east–west axis.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of the Forbidden City, viewed from the Jingshan Park\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The North-South Central Axis of Beijing City\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Beijing\n\nThree styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the Forbidden City, the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.[72] Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the Beijing CBD in east Beijing such as the new CCTV Headquarters, in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the Beijing National Stadium and National Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the CTBUH Skyscraper Award for best overall tall building twice, for the Linked Hybrid building in 2009 and the CCTV Headquarters in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\n\n\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and neofuturistic style of architecture can be seen at the 798 Art Zone, which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's tallest building is the 528-meter China Zun.\n\n\n\n![](image)Wangjing SOHO\nBeijing is famous for its *siheyuans*, a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching-ling. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called *hutongs*. The *hutongs* are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, *siheyuans* and *hutongs* are rapidly disappearing,[73] as entire city blocks of *hutongs* are replaced by high-rise buildings.[74] Residents of the *hutongs* are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community and street life of the *hutongs* cannot be replaced,[75] and these properties are often government owned.[76]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing average annual temperatures from 1970 to 2019 during summer (June, July, and August) and winter (December, January, and February). Weather station data from NOAA. For comparison the Global Surface Temperature Anomaly rose by approximately one degree over the same time period. Beijing has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: *Dwa*), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: *BSk*) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cwa*), characterized by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and brief but cold, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone.[77] Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn, similar to spring, is a season of transition and minimal precipitation. The monthly daily average temperature in January is −3.5 °C (25.7 °F), while in July it is 26.8 °C (80.2 °F). Precipitation averages around 577 mm (23 in) annually, with close to three-quarters of that total falling from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47% in July to 65% in January and February, the city receives 2,455 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from −27.4 °C (−17.3 °F) on 22 February 1966 to 41.9 °C (107.4 °F) on 24 July 1999 (unofficial record of 42.6 °C (108.7 °F) was set on 15 June 1942).[78][79]\n\n\n| Climate data for Beijing (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1951–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −2.7(27.1)\n | 0.6(33.1)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | −1.0(30.2)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | −5.0(23.0)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −22.8(−9.0)\n | −27.4(−17.3)\n | −15(5)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | −3.5(25.7)\n | −12.3(9.9)\n | −18.3(−0.9)\n | −27.4(−17.3)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 5.8(0.23)\n | 8.6(0.34)\n | 21.7(0.85)\n | 36.1(1.42)\n | 72.4(2.85)\n | 169.7(6.68)\n | 113.4(4.46)\n | 53.7(2.11)\n | 28.7(1.13)\n | 13.5(0.53)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 528(20.78)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 1.6\n | 2.3\n | 3.0\n | 4.7\n | 6.0\n | 10.0\n | 11.9\n | 10.5\n | 7.1\n | 5.2\n | 2.9\n | 1.6\n | 66.8\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 2.8\n | 2.5\n | 1.3\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 1.7\n | 2.8\n | 11.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 43\n | 42\n | 40\n | 43\n | 47\n | 58\n | 69\n | 71\n | 64\n | 58\n | 54\n | 46\n | 53\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 188.1\n | 189.1\n | 231.1\n | 243.2\n | 265.1\n | 221.6\n | 190.5\n | 205.3\n | 206.1\n | 199.9\n | 173.4\n | 177.1\n | 2,490.5\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 62\n | 62\n | 62\n | 61\n | 59\n | 50\n | 42\n | 49\n | 56\n | 59\n | 59\n | 61\n | 57\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 5\n |\n| Source 1: China Meteorological Administration[80][81] |\n| Source 2: Extremes[b] and Weather Atlas[85] |\n\n#### Note[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** When Europeans first came into sustained contact with China, \"Pekin\" and \"Peking\" were the most popular ways of romanizing the name of Beijing.[52][53]\n2. **^** All-time record high;[79] February record high;[82] May record high;[83] June record high[84]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

For example, surface albedo, wind speed and humidity near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface air temperatures, vertical air dilution and ozone levels were increased.[87] Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel, Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to health issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy smog struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, impacting a total of 600 million people. After this \"pollution shock\" air pollution became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.[88]\n\n\n\n#### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nJoint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35–60% of the ozone can be traced to sources outside the city. Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a \"significant influence on Beijing's air quality\",[89] partly due to the prevailing south/southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest.\n\n\nIn preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics and to fulfill promises to clean up the city's air, nearly US$17 billion was spent.[90] Beijing implemented a number of air improvement schemes for the duration of the Games, including halting work at all construction sites, closing many factories in Beijing permanently, temporarily shutting industry in neighboring regions, closing some gas stations,[91] and cutting motor traffic by half by limiting drivers to odd or even days (based on their license plate numbers),[92] reducing bus and subway fares, opening new subway lines, and banning high-emission vehicles.[93][94] The city further assembled 3,800 natural gas-powered buses, one of the largest fleets in the world.[90] Beijing became the first city in China to require the Chinese equivalent to the Euro 4 emission standard.[95]\n\n\nCoal burning accounts for about 40% of the PM 2.5 in Beijing and is also the chief source of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide.[96] Since 2012, the city has been converting coal-fired power stations to burn natural gas[97] and aims to cap annual coal consumption at 20 million tons. In 2011, the city burned 26.3 million tons of coal, 73% of which for heating and power generation and the remainder for industry.[97] Much of the city's air pollutants are emitted by neighboring regions.[96] Coal consumption in neighboring Tianjin is expected to increase from 48 to 63 million tons from 2011 to 2015.[98] Hebei Province burned over 300 million tons of coal in 2011, more than all of Germany, of which only 30% were used for power generation and a considerable portion for steel and cement making.[99] Power plants in the coal-mining regions of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, where coal consumption has tripled since 2000, and Shandong also contribute to air pollution in Beijing.[96] Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, respectively rank from first to fourth, among Chinese provinces by coal consumption.[98] There were four major coal-fired power plants in the city to provide electricity as well as heating during the winter. The first one (Gaojing Thermal Power Plant) was shut down in 2014.[100] Another two were shut in March 2015. The last one (Huaneng Thermal Power Plant) would be shut in 2016.[101] Between 2013 and 2017, the city planned to reduce 13 million tons of coal consumption and cap coal consumption to 15 million tons in 2015.[101]\n\n\nThe government sometimes uses cloud-seeding measures to increase the likelihood of rain showers in the region to clear the air prior to large events, such as prior to the 60th anniversary parade in 2009 as well as to combat drought conditions in the area.[102] More recently, however, the government has increased its usage of such measures as closing factories temporarily and implementing greater restrictions for cars on the road, as in the case of \"APEC blue\" and \"parade blue,\" short periods during and immediately preceding the APEC China 2014 and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, respectively.[103] During and prior to these events, Beijing's air quality improved dramatically, only to fall back to unhealthy levels shortly after.\n\n\nBeijing air quality is often poor, especially in winter. In mid-January 2013, Beijing's air quality was measured on top of the city's US embassy at a PM2.5 density of 755 micrograms per cubic meter, which is more than 75 times the safe level established by the WHO, and went off the US Environmental Protection Agency's air quality index. It was widely reported, originally through a Twitter account, that the category was \"crazy bad\". This was later changed to \"beyond index\".[104]\n\n\nOn 8 and 9 December 2015 Beijing had its first smog alert which shut down a majority of the industry and other commercial businesses in the city.[105] Later in the month another smog \"red alert\" was issued.[106]\n\n\nAccording to Beijing's environmental protection bureau's announcement in November 2016, starting from 2017 highly polluting old cars will be banned from being driven whenever Smog \"red alerts\" are issued in the city or neighboring regions.[107]\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been measurable reductions in pollutants after the \"war on pollution\" was declared in 2014, with Beijing seeing a 35% reduction in fine particulates in 2017[108] and further reduction by 2020.[109]: 52\n\n\n\n### Readings[edit]\n\n\nDue to Beijing's high level of air pollution, there are various readings by different sources on the subject. Daily pollution readings at 27 monitoring stations around the city are reported on the website of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB).[110] The American Embassy of Beijing also reports hourly fine particulate (PM2.5) and ozone levels on Twitter.[111] Since the BJEPB and US Embassy measure different pollutants according to different criteria, the pollution levels and the impact to human health reported by the BJEPB are often lower than that reported by the US Embassy.[111]\n\n\nThe smog is causing harm and danger to the population. The air pollution does directly result in significant impact on the mobility rate of cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease in Beijing.[112] Exposure to large concentrations of polluted air can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, emergency room visits, and even death.[113]\n\n\n\n#### Dust storms[edit]\n\n\nDust from the erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city; the Beijing Weather Modification Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects.[114] In the first four months of 2006 alone, there were no fewer than eight such storms.[115] In April 2002, one dust storm alone dumped nearly 50,000 tons of dust onto the city before moving on to Japan and Korea.[116]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Beijing\n\nThe municipal government is regulated by the local Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by the Beijing CCP Secretary (Chinese: 中共北京市委书记). The local CCP issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\n\n\nGovernment officials include the mayor (Chinese: 市长) and vice-mayor. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs. Additionally, as the capital of China, Beijing houses all of the important national governmental and political institutions, including the National People's Congress.[117]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Beijing and List of township-level divisions of Beijing.\n\nBeijing Municipality currently comprises 16 administrative county-level subdivisions including 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. On 1 July 2010, Chongwen and Xuanwu were merged into Dongcheng and Xicheng, respectively. On 13 November 2015 Miyun and Yanqing were upgraded to districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Beijing** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Dongcheng**\n\n**Xicheng**\n\n**Chaoyang**\n\n**Fengtai**\n\n**Shijingshan**\n\n**Haidian**\n\n**Mentougou**\n\n**Fangshan**\n\n**Tongzhou**\n\n**Shunyi**\n\n**Changping**\n\n**Daxing**\n\n**Huairou**\n\n**Pinggu**\n\n**Miyun**\n\n**Yanqing**\n |\n| Division code[118] | Division\n | Area in km2[119] | Total population 2010[120] | Urban areapopulation 2010[121] | Seat\n | Postal code\n | Subdivisions[122][*full citation needed*] |\n| Subdistricts | Towns | Townships[n 1] | Residential communities | Villages |\n| 110000 | Beijing\n | 16406.16 | 19,612,368 | 16,858,692 | Dongcheng / Tongzhou | 100000 | 149 | 143 | 38 | 2538 | 3857\n |\n| 110101 | Dongcheng | 41.82 | 919,253 | Jingshan Subdistrict | 100000 | 17 |  |  | 216 |  |\n| 110102 | Xicheng | 50.33 | 1,243,315 | Jinrong Street Subdistrict | 100000 | 15 |  |  | 259 |  |\n| 110105 | Chaoyang | 454.78 | 3,545,137 | 3,532,257 | Chaowai Subdistrict | 100000 | 24 |  | 19 | 358 | 5\n |\n| 110106 | Fengtai | 305.53 | 2,112,162 | 2,098,632 | Fengtai Subdistrict | 100000 | 16 | 2 | 3 | 254 | 73\n |\n| 110107 | Shijingshan | 84.38 | 616,083 | Lugu Subdistrict | 100000 | 9 |  |  | 130 |  |\n| 110108 | Haidian | 430.77 | 3,280,670 | 3,208,563 | Haidian Subdistrict | 100000 | 22 | 7 |  | 603 | 84\n |\n| 110109 | Mentougou | 1447.85 | 290,476 | 248,547 | Dayu Subdistrict | 102300 | 4 | 9 |  | 124 | 179\n |\n| 110111 | Fangshan | 1994.73 | 944,832 | 635,282 | Gongchen Subdistrict | 102400 | 8 | 14 | 6 | 108 | 462\n |\n| 110112 | Tongzhou | 905.79 | 1,184,256 | 724,228 | Beiyuan Subdistrict | 101100 | 6 | 10 | 1 | 40 | 480\n |\n| 110113 | Shunyi | 1019.51 | 876,620 | 471,459 | Shengli Subdistrict | 101300 | 6 | 19 |  | 61 | 449\n |\n| 110114 | Changping | 1342.47 | 1,660,501 | 1,310,617 | Chengbei Subdistrict | 102200 | 8 | 14 |  | 180 | 303\n |\n| 110115 | Daxing | 1036.34 | 1,365,112 | 965,683 | Xingfeng Subdistrict | 102600 | 5 | 14 |  | 64 | 547\n |\n| 110116 | Huairou | 2122.82 | 372,887 | 253,088 | Longshan Subdistrict | 101400 | 2 | 12 | 2 | 27 | 286\n |\n| 110117 | Pinggu | 948.24 | 415,958 | 219,850 | Binhe Subdistrict | 101200 | 2 | 14 | 2 | 23 | 275\n |\n| 110118 | Miyun | 2225.92 | 467,680 | 257,449 | Gulou Subdistrict | 101500 | 2 | 17 | 1 | 57 | 338\n |\n| 110119 | Yanqing | 1994.89 | 317,426 | 154,386 | Rulin Subdistrict | 102100 | 3 | 11 | 4 | 34 | 376\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Divisions in Chinese\n |\n| --- |\n| English\n | Chinese\n | Pinyin\n |\n| Beijing Municipality\n | 北京市 | Běijīng Shì\n |\n| Dongcheng District | 东城区 | Dōngchéng Qū\n |\n| Xicheng District | 西城区 | Xīchéng Qū\n |\n| Chaoyang District | 朝阳区 | Cháoyáng Qū\n |\n| Fengtai District | 丰台区 | Fēngtái Qū\n |\n| Shijingshan District | 石景山区 | Shíjǐngshān Qū\n |\n| Haidian District | 海淀区 | Hǎidiàn Qū\n |\n| Mentougou District | 门头沟区 | Méntóugōu Qū\n |\n| Fangshan District | 房山区 | Fángshān Qū\n |\n| Tongzhou District | 通州区 | Tōngzhōu Qū\n |\n| Shunyi District | 顺义区 | Shùnyì Qū\n |\n| Changping District | 昌平区 | Chāngpíng Qū\n |\n| Daxing District | 大兴区 | Dàxīng Qū\n |\n| Huairou District | 怀柔区 | Huáiróu Qū\n |\n| Pinggu District | 平谷区 | Pínggǔ Qū\n |\n| Miyun District | 密云区 | Mìyún Qū\n |\n| Yanqing District | 延庆区 | Yánqìng Qū\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Including Ethnic townships & other township related subdivisions.\n\n#### Towns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of township-level divisions of Beijing\n\nBeijing's 16 county-level divisions (districts) are further subdivided into 273 lower third-level administrative units at the township level: 119 towns, 24 townships, 5 ethnic townships and 125 subdistricts.\nTowns within Beijing Municipality but outside the urban area include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n* Changping 昌平\n* Huairou 怀柔\n* Miyun 密云\n* Liangxiang 良乡\n* Liulimiao 琉璃庙\n* Tongzhou 通州\n* Yizhuang 亦庄\n* Tiantongyuan 天通苑\n* Beiyuan 北苑\n* Xiaotangshan 小汤山\n\nSeveral place names in Beijing end with *mén* (门), meaning \"gate\", as they were the locations of gates in the former Beijing city wall. Other place names end in *cūn* (村), meaning \"village\", as they were originally villages outside the city wall.\n\n\n\n### Judiciary and procuracy[edit]\n\n\nThe judicial system in Beijing consists of the Supreme People's Court, the highest court in the country, the Beijing Municipal High People's Court, the high people's court of the municipality, three intermediate people's courts, one intermediate railway transport court, 14 basic people's court (one for each of the municipality's districts and counties), and one basic railway transport court. The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in Shijingshan oversees the basic courts of Haidian, Shijingshan, Mentougou, Changping and Yanqing.[123] The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court in Fengtai oversees the basic courts of Dongcheng, Xicheng, Fengtai, Fangshan and Daxing.[123] The Beijing No. 3 Intermediate People's Court in Laiguangying, is the newest of the three intermediate people's courts and opened on 21 August 2013.[123] It oversees the district courts of Chaoyang, Tongzhou, Shunyi, Huairou, Pinggu and Miyun.[123][124] Each court in Beijing has a corresponding people's procuratorate.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Beijing\n\n![](image)Beijing products treemap, 2020\nAs of 2022[update], Beijing's nominal GDP was CN¥4.16 trillion ($619 billion in nominal, $1.016 trillion in PPP), about 3.44% of the country's GDP and ranked 13th among province-level administrative units; its nominal GDP per capita was US$28,258 (CN¥190,059) and ranked the 1st in the country.[3][125] It also ranks the tenth largest in the metropolitan economies in the world.[126] Beijing's nominal GDP is projected to reach US$1.1 trillion in 2035, ranking among the world's top 10 largest cities (together with Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in China) according to a study by Oxford Economics,[127] and its nominal GDP per capita will reach US$45,000 in 2030.[128]\n\n\nDue to the concentration of state owned enterprises in the national capital, Beijing in 2013 had more Fortune Global 500 Company headquarters than any other city in the world.[129] As of August 2022, Beijing has 54 Fortune Global 500 companies, more than Japan (47), the third-place country after China (145) and the United States (124).[130][131] Beijing has also been described as the \"billionaire capital of the world\".[132][133] In 2020, Beijing is the fifth wealthiest city in the world, with a total wealth amounts to $2 trillion.[134] Beijing is classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and worldwide and making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[135] In the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index, Beijing was ranked as having the sixth-most competitive financial center in the world and fourth-most competitive in the whole Asia & Oceania region (behind Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore).[136]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Beijing was ranked first globally in terms of \"*Global City Competitiveness*\" in the *2020–2021 Global Urban Competitiveness Report* jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the United Nations Programme for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat).[137]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical GDP of Beijing for 1978–present (SNA2008)[138]

GDP is based on mid-year population.\n\n\n\n### Sector composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Taikoo Li Sanlitun shopping arcade is a destination for locals and visitors.\nThe city has a post-industrial economy that is dominated by the tertiary sector (services), which generated 83.8% of output, followed by the secondary sector (manufacturing, construction) at 15.8% and the primary sector (agriculture, mining) at 0.26%.[3] The services sector is broadly diversified with professional services, wholesale and retail, information technology, commercial real estate, scientific research, and residential real estate each contributing at least 6% to the city's economy in 2022.[3][140]\n\n\nThe single largest sub-sector remains industry, whose share of overall output has shrunk to 12.1% in 2022.[3] The mix of industrial output has changed significantly since 2010 when the city announced that 140 highly-polluting, energy and water resource intensive enterprises would be relocated from the city in five years.[141] The relocation of Capital Steel to neighboring Hebei province had begun in 2005.[142][143] In 2013, output of automobiles, aerospace products, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and food processing all increased.[140]\n\n\nIn the farmland around Beijing, vegetables and fruits have displaced grain as the primary crops under cultivation.[140] In 2013, the tonnage of vegetable, edible fungus and fruit harvested was over three times that of grain.[140] In 2013, overall acreage under cultivation shrank along with most categories of produce as more land was reforested for environmental reasons.[140]\n\n\n\n### Economic zones[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of economic and technological development zones in Beijing.\n\n![](image)The skyline of Beijing CBD\n![](image)Zhongguancun is a technology hub in Haidian District.\nIn 2006, the city government identified six high-end economic output zones around Beijing as the primary engines for local economic growth. In 2012, the six zones produced 43.3% of the city's GDP, up from 36.5% in 2007.[144][145]\nThe six zones are:\n\n\n\n1. Zhongguancun, China's silicon village in Haidian District northwest of the city, is home to both established and start-up tech companies. In the first two quarters of 2014, 9,895 companies registered in the six zones, among which 6,150 were based in Zhongguancun.[146] Zhongguancun is also the center of Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Hi-Tech Industrial Belt.\n2. Beijing Financial Street, in Xicheng District on the west side of the city between Fuxingmen and Fuchengmen, is lined with headquarters of large state banks and insurance companies. The country's financial regulatory agencies including the central bank, bank regulator, securities regulator, and foreign exchange authority are located in the neighborhood.\n3. Beijing Central Business District (CBD), is actually located to the east of downtown, near the embassies along the eastern Third Ring Road between Jianguomenwai and Chaoyangmenwai. The CBD is home to most of the city's skyscraper office buildings. Most of the city's foreign companies and professional service firms are based in the CBD.\n4. Beijing Economic and Technological Development Area, better known as Yizhuang, is an industrial park the straddles the southern Fifth Ring Road in Daxing District. It has attracted pharmaceutical, information technology, and materials engineering companies.[147]\n5. Beijing Airport Economic Zone was created in 1993 and surrounds the Beijing Capital International Airport in Shunyi District northeast of the city. In addition to logistics, airline services, and trading firms, this zone is also home to Beijing's automobile assembly plants.\n6. Beijing Olympic Center Zone surrounds the Olympic Green due north of downtown and is developing into an entertainment, sports, tourism and business convention center.\n\n\nShijingshan, on the western outskirts of the city, is a traditional heavy industrial base for steel-making.[148] Chemical plants are concentrated in the far eastern suburbs.\n\n\nLess legitimate enterprises also exist. Urban Beijing is known for being a center of infringed goods; anything from the latest designer clothing to DVDs can be found in markets all over the city, often marketed to expatriates and international visitors.[149]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Beijing\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1953 | 2,768,149 | —     |\n| 1964 | 7,568,495 | +9.57% |\n| 1982 | 9,230,687 | +1.11% |\n| 1990 | 10,819,407 | +2.00% |\n| 2000 | 13,569,194 | +2.29% |\n| 2010 | 19,612,368 | +3.75% |\n| 2020[138] | 21,893,095 | +1.11% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes on administrative divisions. |\n\n\nIn 2021, Beijing had a total population of 21.89 million within the municipality, of which 19.16 million (87.5 percent) resided in urban districts or suburban townships and 2.73 million (12.5) lived in rural villages.[3] The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010[update], a population of 24.9 million.[150][151]\n\n\nWithin China, the city ranked second in urban population after Shanghai and the third in municipal population after Shanghai and Chongqing. Beijing also ranks among the most populous cities in the world, a distinction the city has held for much of the past 800 years, especially during the 15th to early 19th centuries when it was the largest city in the world.\n\n\nAbout 13 million of the city's residents in 2013 had local *hukou* permits, which entitles them to permanent residence in Beijing.[140] The remaining 8 million residents had *hukou* permits elsewhere and were not eligible to receive some social benefits provided by the Beijing municipal government.[140]\n\n\nThe population increased in 2013 by 455,000 or about 7% from the previous year and continued a decade-long trend of rapid growth.[140] The total population in 2004 was 14.213 million.[152] The population gains are driven largely by migration. The population's rate of natural increase in 2013 was a mere 0.441%, based on a birth rate of 8.93 and a mortality rate of 4.52.[140] The gender balance was 51.6% males and 48.4% females.[140]\n\n\nWorking age people account for nearly 73.6% of the population.[3] Compared to 2004, residents age 0–14 as a proportion of the population dropped from 9.95% to 9.92% in 2013, but again increased to 12.1% in 2021.[3]\nResidents over the age of 65 declined from 11.12% to 8.58%, but increased to 14.2% in 2021.[3] From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of city residents with at least some college education nearly doubled, from 20.4% to 37.3%, and further increased to 49.1% by 2021.[3] About 66.4% have senior secondary school education and 88.2% had reached middle school.[3]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, nearly 96% of Beijing's population are ethnic Han Chinese.[153] Of the 800,000 ethnic minority population living in the capital, Manchu (336,000), Hui (249,000), Korean (77,000), Mongol (37,000) and Tujia (24,000) constitute the five largest groups.[154] In addition, there were 8,045 Hong Kong residents, 500 Macau residents, and 7,772 Taiwan residents along with 91,128 registered foreigners living in Beijing.[153] A study by the Beijing Academy of Sciences estimates that in 2010 there were on average 200,000 foreigners living in Beijing on any given day including students, business travellers and tourists that are not counted as registered residents.[155]\n\n\nIn 2017 the Chinese government implemented population controls for Beijing and Shanghai to fight what it called the \"big city disease\" which includes congestion, pollution, and shortages of education and health care services. From this policy, Beijing's population declined by 20,000 from 2016 to 2017.[156] Some low-income people are being forcibly removed from the city as both legal and illegal housing is being demolished in some high-density residential neighborhoods.[156] The population is being redistributed to Jing-Jin-Ji and Xiong'an New Area, the transfer to the latter expected to include 300,000-500,000 people working in government research, universities, and corporate headquarters.[157][158]\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Beijing, Education in China, and Higher education in China\n\nSee also: Rankings of universities in China, List of universities in China, and Double First Class University Plan\nBeijing is a world leading center for scientific and technological innovation and has been ranked the No.1 city in the world with the largest scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][159][28] The city is also leading the world with the highest share of articles published in the fields of physical sciences, chemistry, and earth and environmental sciences, especially in the United Nations'17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related output.[160][161][162][163]\n\n\nBeijing has over 90 public colleges and universities, which is the largest urban public university system in Asia and the first city in China with most higher education institutions,[164][165] and it is home to the two best universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in the whole of Asia-Oceania region and emerging countries with its shared rankings at 16th place in the world by the 2022 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[166][167][26] Both are members of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.[168]\n\n\nBeijing also has the highest number of universities of any city in the country, representing more than one-fifth of 147 Double First-Class Universities, a national plan to develop elite Chinese universities into world-class institutions by the end of 2050.[169] A number of Beijing's most prestigious universities consistently rank among the best in the

universities\" or \"211 universities\" by the Chinese government in order to build world-class universities.[173][174]\n\n\nThe city is a seat of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has been consistently ranked the No.1 research institute in the world by *Nature Index* since the list's inception in 2014, by Nature Research.[175][176][177] The academy also runs the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is located in Beijing and ranked among the world's top five research institutions by the Nature Index.[178] Beijing is also a site of Chinese Academy of Engineering, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n\n\nSome of the national key universities in Beijing are:\n\n* Beijing Forestry University\n* Beijing Jiaotong

Program for International Student Assessment, a worldwide study of academic performance conducted by the OECD.[179]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Beijing Ancient Observatory\nPeople native to urban Beijing speak the Beijing dialect, which belongs to the Mandarin subdivision of spoken Chinese. This speech is the basis for *putonghua*, the standard spoken language used in mainland China and Taiwan, and one of the four official languages of Singapore. Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have their own dialects akin to those of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.\n\n\nBeijing or Peking opera is a traditional form of Chinese theater well known throughout the nation. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of Chinese culture, Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song, spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences involving gestures, movement, fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic stage dialect quite different from Modern Standard Chinese and from the modern Beijing dialect.[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sliced Peking duck served with traditional condiments\nBeijing cuisine is the local style of cooking. Peking duck is perhaps the best known dish. Fuling jiabing, a traditional Beijing snack food, is a pancake (*bing*) resembling a flat disk with a filling made from *fu ling*, a fungus used in traditional Chinese medicine. Teahouses are also common in Beijing.\n\n\nThe cloisonné (or *Jingtailan*, literally \"Blue of Jingtai\") metalworking technique and tradition is a Beijing art speciality, and is one of the most revered traditional crafts in China. Cloisonné making requires elaborate and complicated processes which include base-hammering, copper-strip inlay, soldering, enamel-filling, enamel-firing, surface polishing and gilding.[181] Beijing's lacquerware is also well known for its sophisticated and intricate patterns and images carved into its surface, and the various decoration techniques of lacquer include \"carved lacquer\" and \"engraved gold\".\n\n\nYounger residents of Beijing have become more attracted to the nightlife, which has flourished in recent decades, breaking prior cultural traditions that had practically restricted it to the upper class.[182] Today, Houhai, Sanlitun and Wudaokou are Beijing's nightlife hotspots.\n\n\nIn 2012 Beijing was named as City of Design and became part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.[183]\n\n\n\n### Places of interest[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Major National Historical and Cultural Sites (Beijing) and List of Beijing landmarks\n\n\n> ...the city remains an epicenter of tradition with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on view—in the famed Forbidden City and in the city's lush pavilions and gardens...\n> \n> — National Geographic[184]\n> \n\n\n![](image)Qianmen Avenue, a traditional commercial street outside Qianmen Gate along the southern Central Axis\n![](image)Inside the Forbidden City\nAt the historical heart of Beijing lies the Forbidden City, the enormous palace compound that was the home of the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties;[185] the Forbidden City hosts the Palace Museum, which contains imperial collections of Chinese art. Surrounding the Forbidden City are several former imperial gardens, parks and scenic areas, notably Beihai, Shichahai, Zhongnanhai, Jingshan and Zhongshan. These places, particularly Beihai Park, are described as masterpieces of Chinese gardening art,[186] and are tourist destinations of historical importance;[187] in the modern era, Zhongnanhai has also been the political heart of various Chinese governments and regimes and is now the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council. From Tiananmen Square, right across from the Forbidden City, there are several notable sites, such as the Tiananmen, Qianmen, the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, the Monument to the People's Heroes, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The Summer Palace and the Old Summer Palace both lie at the western part of the city; the former, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[188] contains a comprehensive collection of imperial gardens and palaces that served as the summer retreats for the Qing imperial family.\n\n\nAmong the best known religious sites in the city is the Temple of Heaven (*Tiantan*), located in southeastern Beijing, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[189] where emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties made visits for annual ceremonies of prayers to Heaven for good harvest. In the north of the city is the Temple of Earth (*Ditan*), while the Temple of the Sun (*Ritan*) and the Temple of the Moon (*Yuetan*) lie in the eastern and western urban areas respectively. Other well-known temple sites include the Dongyue Temple, Tanzhe Temple, Miaoying Temple, White Cloud Temple, Yonghe Temple, Fayuan Temple, Wanshou Temple and Big Bell Temple. The city also has its own Confucius Temple, and a Guozijian or Imperial Academy. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, built in 1605, is the oldest Catholic church in Beijing. The Niujie Mosque is the oldest mosque in Beijing, with a history stretching back over a thousand years.\n\n\n\n![](image)Universal Studios Beijing\n![](image)Happy Valley Beijing\nBeijing contains several well-preserved pagodas and stone pagodas, such as the towering Pagoda of Tianning Temple, which was built during the Liao dynasty from 1100 to 1120, and the Pagoda of Cishou Temple, which was built in 1576 during the Ming dynasty. Historically noteworthy stone bridges include the 12th-century Lugou Bridge, the 17th-century Baliqiao bridge, and the 18th-century Jade Belt Bridge. The Beijing Ancient Observatory displays pre-telescopic spheres dating back to the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Fragrant Hills (*Xiangshan*) is a public park that consists of natural landscaped areas as well as traditional and cultural relics. The Beijing Botanical Garden exhibits over 6,000 species of plants, including a variety of trees, bushes and flowers, and an extensive peony garden. The Taoranting, Longtan, Chaoyang, Haidian, Milu Yuan and Zizhu Yuan parks are some of the notable recreational parks in the city. The Beijing Zoo is a center of zoological research that also contains rare animals from various continents, including the Chinese giant panda.\n\n\nThere are 144 museums and galleries (as of June 2008[update]) in the city.[190][191][192] In addition to the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City and the National Museum of China, other major museums include the National Art Museum of China, the Capital Museum, the Beijing Art Museum, the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Geological Museum of China, the Beijing Museum of Natural History and the Paleozoological Museum of China.[192]\n\n\nLocated at the outskirts of urban Beijing, but within its municipality are the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming dynasty, the lavish and elaborate burial sites of thirteen Ming emperors, which have been designated as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.[193] The archaeological Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian is another World Heritage Site within the municipality,[194] containing a wealth of discoveries, among them one of the first specimens of *Homo erectus* and an assemblage of bones of the gigantic hyena *Pachycrocuta brevirostris*. There are several sections of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Great Wall of China,[195] most notably Badaling, Jinshanling, Simatai and Mutianyu. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Beijing is the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[196] Theme parks located within the city include Universal Studios Beijing and Happy Valley Beijing, both of which are among the most visited theme parks in Asia.[197]\n\n\n\n### Intangible cultural heritage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Peking opera\nThe cultural heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse. Starting 2006, the Beijing government started the process of selecting and preserving cultural heritages. Five cultural heritage lists have been published over the years. 288 distinct practices are categorized as cultural heritage. These 288 cultural heritages are further divided into ten categories, namely folk music, folk dance, traditional opera, melodious art, juggling and game, folk art, traditional handicraft, traditional medicine, folk literature and folklore.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n* Folk music\n\t+ Zhihua Temple music\n\t+ Tongzhou shanty\n* Folk dance\n\t+ Tongzhou Dragon dance\n\t+ Miliangtun Stilts\n* Traditional opera\n\t+ Kunqu\n\t+ Peking opera\n* Melodious art\n\t+ Xiangsheng\n* Acrobatic Performance and game\n\t+ Weiqi(Go)\n\t+ Xiangqi\n* Folk art\n\t+ Ivory carving\n* Traditional handicraft\n\t+ Peking duck manufacturing techniques\n\t+ Cloisonné manufacturing techniques\n* Traditional medicine\n\t+ Tong Ren Tang culture\n* Folk literature\n\t+ Yongding River legend[*permanent dead link*]\n* Folklore\n\t+ Miaohui\n\t+ Lantern Festival\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThe religious heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse as Chinese folk religion, Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam and Christianity all have significant historical presence in the city. As the national capital, the city also hosts the State Administration for Religious Affairs and various state-sponsored institutions of the leading religions.[202] In recent decades, foreign residents have brought other religions to the city.[202] According to Wang Zhiyun of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2010 there were 2.2 million Buddhists in the city, equal to 11.2% of the total population.[203] According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 0.78% of the city's population.[204] According to a 2010 survey, Muslims constitute 1.76% of the population of Beijing.[205]\n\n\n\n### Chinese folk religion and Taoism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fire God Temple in Di'anmen\nBeijing has many temples dedicated to folk religious and communal deities, many of which are being reconstructed or refurbished in the 2000s and 2010s. Yearly sacrifices to the God of Heaven (祭天; *jìtiān*) at the Temple of Heaven have been resumed by Confucian groups in the 2010s.\n\n\nThere are temples dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (娘娘; *Niángniáng*) in the city, one of them near the Olympic Village, and they revolve around a major cult center at Mount Miaofeng. There are also many temples consecrated to the Dragon God, to the Medicine Master (药王; *Yàowáng*), to Divus Guan (Guan Yu), to the Fire God (火神; *Huǒshén*), to the Wealth God, temples of the City God, and at least one temple consecrated to the Yellow Deity of the Chariot Shaft (轩辕黄帝; *Xuānyuán Huángdì*) in Pinggu District. Many of these temples are governed by the Beijing Taoist Association, such as the Fire God Temple of the Shicha Lake, while many others are not and are governed by popular committees and locals. A great Temple of Xuanyuan Huangdi will be built in Pinggu (possibly as an expansion of the already existing shrine) within 2020, and the temple will feature a statue of the deity which will be amongst the tallest in the world.[206][207]\n\n\nThe national Chinese Taoist Association and Chinese Taoist College have their headquarters at the White Cloud Temple of Quanzhen Taoism, which was founded in 741 and rebuilt numerous times. The Beijing Dongyue Temple outside Chaoyangmen is the largest temple of Zhengyi Taoism in the city. The local Beijing Taoist Association has its headquarters at the Lüzu Temple near Fuxingmen.[208]\n\n\n\n### Buddhism[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The Buddhist Association of China, the state's supervisory organ overseeing all Buddhist institutions in mainland China, is headquartered in the Guangji Temple, a temple founded over 800 years ago during the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in what is now Fuchengmennei (阜成门内). The Beijing Buddhist Association along with the Buddhist Choir and Orchestra are based in the Guanghua Temple, which dates to the Yuan dynasty over 700 years ago. The Buddhist Academy of China and its library are housed in the Fayuan Temple near Caishikou. The Fayuan Temple, which dates to the Tang dynasty 1300 years ago, is the oldest temple in urban Beijing. The Tongjiao Temple inside Dongzhimen is the city's only Buddhist nunnery.\n\n\nThe Xihuang Temple originally dates to the Liao dynasty. In 1651, the temple was commissioned by the Qing Emperor Shunzhi to host the visit of the Fifth Dalai Lama to Beijing. Since then, this temple has hosted the 13th Dalai Lama as well as the Sixth, Ninth and Tenth Panchen Lamas.\n\n\nThe largest Tibetan Buddhist Temple in Beijing is the Yonghe Temple, which was decreed by the Qing Emperor Qianlong in 1744 to serve as the residence and research facility for his Buddhist preceptor of Rölpé Dorjé the third Changkya (or living Buddha of Inner Mongolia). The Yonghe Temple is so-named because it was the childhood residence of the Yongzheng Emperor, and retains the glazed tiles reserved for imperial palaces. While the \"High-level Tibetan Buddhism College of China\", China's highest institution college of Tibetan Buddhism, situated near the Yonghe Temple. The Lingguang Temple of Badachu in the Western Hills also dates to the Tang dynasty. The temple's Zhaoxian Pagoda (招仙塔) was first built in 1071 during the Liao dynasty to hold a tooth relic of the Buddha. The pagoda was destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion and the tooth was discovered from its foundation. A new pagoda was built in 1964. The six aforementioned temples: Guangji, Guanghua, Tongjiao, Xihuang, Yonghe and Lingguang have been designated National Key Buddhist Temples in Han Chinese Area.\n\n\nIn addition, other notable temples in Beijing include the Tanzhe Temple (founded in the Jin dynasty (266–420) is the oldest in the municipality), the Tianning Temple (oldest pagoda in the city), the Miaoying Temple (famed for Yuan-era white pagoda), the Wanshou Temple (home to the Beijing Art Museum) and the Big Bell Temple (Dazhong Temple).\n\n\n\n### Islam[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Niujie Mosque\nBeijing has about 70 mosques recognized by the Islamic Association of China, whose headquarters are located next to the Niujie Mosque, the oldest mosque in the city.[209][210] The Niujie Mosque was founded in 996 during the Liao dynasty and is frequently visited by Muslim dignitaries. The Chinese Muslim community reportedly celebrated Ramadan and made Eid prayers at the mosque on 2021.[211][212]\n\n\nThe largest mosque[213] in Beijing is ChangYing mosque, located in ChaoYang district, with an area of 8,400 square meters.\n\n\nOther notable mosques in the old city include the Dongsi Mosque, founded in 1346; the Huashi Mosque, founded in 1415; Nan Douya Mosque, near Chaoyangmen; Jinshifang Street Mosque, in Xicheng District; and the Dongzhimen Mosque.[214] There are large mosques in outlying Muslim communities in Haidian, Madian, Tongzhou, Changping, Changying, Shijingshan and Miyun. The China Islamic Institute is located in the Niujie neighborhood in Xicheng District.\n\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Church of the Saviour, also known as the Xishiku Church, built in 1703\n#### Catholicism[edit]\n\n\nIn 1289, John of Montecorvino came to Beijing as a Franciscan missionary with the order from the Pope. After meeting and receiving the support of Kublai Khan in 1293, he built the first Catholic church in Beijing in 1305. The Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA), based in Houhai is the government oversight body for Catholics in mainland China. Notable Catholic churches in Beijing include:\n\n\n\n* the Nantang or Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception also known as the Xuanwumen Church, which was founded in 1605 and whose current archbishop, Joseph Li Shan, is one of the few bishops in China to have the support of both the Vatican and the CPCA.\n* the Dongtang or St. Joseph's Church, better known as the Wangfujing Church, founded in 1653.\n* the Beitang or Church of the Saviour, also known as the Xishiku Church, founded in 1703.\n* the Xitang or Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel also known as the Xizhimen Church, founded in 1723.\n\n\nThe National Seminary of Catholic Church in China is located in Daxing District.\n\n\n\n#### Protestantism[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest Protestant churches in Beijing were founded by British and American missionaries in the second half of the 19th century. Protestant missionaries also opened schools, universities and hospitals which have become important civic institutions. Most of Beijing's Protestant churches were destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion and afterwards rebuilt. In 1958, the 64 Protestant churches in the city are reorganized into four and overseen by the state through the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.\n\n\n\n#### Eastern Orthodox[edit]\n\n\nThere was a significant amount of Orthodox Christians in Beijing. Orthodoxy came to Beijing with Russian prisoners from the Sino-Russian border conflicts of the 17th century.[215] In 1956, Viktor, the bishop of Beijing returned to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet embassy took over the old cathedral and demolished it. In 2007, the Russian embassy built a new church in its garden to serve the Russian Orthodox Christians in Beijing.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n#### Television and radio[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The China Central Television Headquarters building in CBD\nBeijing Television broadcasts on channels 1 through 10, and China Central Television, China's largest television network, maintains its headquarters in Beijing.

Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: Shanghai (Jinghu Line), Guangzhou (Jingguang Line), Kowloon (Jingjiu Line), Harbin (Jingha Line) (including Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)), Baotou (Jingbao Line), Chengde (Jingcheng Line), Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line), Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line) and Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line). In addition, the Datong–Qinhuangdao railway passes through the municipality to the north of the city.\n\n\nBeijing also has six high-speed rail lines: the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway, which opened in 2008; the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, which opened in 2011; the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway, which opened in 2012; and the Beijing–Xiong'an intercity railway and the Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway, both of which opened in 2019. The Beijing–Shenyang high-speed railway was completed in 2021.\n\n\nThe city's main railway stations are the Beijing railway station, which opened in 1959; the Beijing West railway station, which opened in 1996; and the Beijing South railway station, which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008; The Beijing North railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2009; The Qinghe railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2019; The Beijing Chaoyang railway station opened in 2021; The Beijing Fengtai railway station opened in 2022; and the Beijing Sub-Center railway station is under construction.\n\n\nSmaller stations in the city including Beijing East railway station and Daxing Airport station handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.[222]\n\n\nFrom Beijing, direct passenger train service is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam and North Korea. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their direction in relation to Beijing.\n\n\n\n### Roads and expressways[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Expressways of Beijing and China National Highways of Beijing\n\n![](image)View of 4th Ring Road in Chaoyang District\n![](image)Traffic jam on the Beijing–Tongzhou Expressway\nBeijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Many expressways of China serve Beijing, as do 15 China National Highways. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the \"ring roads\" that concentrically surround the city, with the Forbidden City area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official \"1st Ring Road\". The 2nd Ring Road is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend outwards, with the 5th and 6th Ring Roads being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd Ring Road outward. A final outer orbital, the Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95), was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring Tianjin and Hebei.\n\n\nWithin the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with \"inner\" and \"outer\" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.\n\n\n\n![](image)Beijing–Lhasa Expressway in Changping District\nBeijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.[223] The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour. In the beginning of 2010, Beijing had 4 million registered automobiles.[224] By the end of 2010, the government forecast 5 million. In 2010, new car registrations in Beijing averaged 15,500 per week.[225]\n\n\nTowards the end of 2010, the city government announced a series of drastic measures to tackle traffic jams, including limiting the number of new license plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month and barring cars with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hour.[226] More restrictive measures are also reserved during major events or heavily polluted weather.\n\n\nRoad signs began to be standardized with both Chinese and English names displayed, with location names using pinyin, in 2008.[227]\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n#### Beijing Capital International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Terminal 3 of the Beijing Capital International Airport\nBeijing has two of the world's largest airports. The Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK) located 32 kilometres (20 mi) northeast of the city center in Chaoyang District bordering Shunyi District, is the second busiest airport in the world after Atlanta's Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport.[14] Capital Airport's Terminal 3, built during the expansion for the 2008 Olympics, is one of the largest in the world. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China and Hainan Airlines. The Airport Expressway and Second Airport Expressway, connect to Capital Airport from the northeast and east of the city center, respectively. Driving time from city center is about 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. The Capital Airport Express line of Beijing Subway and the Capital Airport Bus serves the Capital Airport.\n\n\n\n#### Beijing Daxing International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing Daxing International Airport\nThe Beijing Daxing International Airport (IATA: PKX) located 46 kilometres (29 mi) south of the city in Daxing District bordering the city of Langfang, Hebei Province, opened on 25 September 2019.[228][229][230] The Daxing Airport has one of the world's largest terminal buildings and is expected to be a major airport serving Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei Province. Daxing Airport is connected to the city via the Beijing–Xiong'an intercity railway, the Daxing Airport Express line of the Beijing Subway and two expressways.\n\n\n\n#### Other airports[edit]\n\n\nWith the opening of the Daxing Airport in September 2019, the Beijing Nanyuan Airport (IATA: NAY), located 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) south of center in Fengtai District, has been closed to civilian airline service. Other airports in the city at Liangxiang, Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling are primarily for military use.\n\n\n\n#### Visa requirements for air passengers[edit]\n\n\nAs of 1 January 2013[update], tourists from 45 countries are permitted a 72-hour visa-free stay in Beijing. The 45 countries include Singapore, Japan, the United States, Canada, all EU and EEA countries (except Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The programme benefits transit and business travellers[231] with the 72 hours calculated starting from the moment visitors receive their transit stay permits rather than the time of their plane's arrival. Foreign visitors are not permitted to leave Beijing for other Chinese cities during the 72 hours.[232]\n\n\n\n### Public transit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Daxing line train on the Beijing Subway, which is among the longest and busiest rapid transit systems in the world\n![](image)An articulated Beijing bus\nThe Beijing Subway, which began operating in 1969, now has 25 lines, 459 stations, and 783 km (487 mi) of lines. It is the longest subway system in the world and first in annual ridership with 3.66 billion rides delivered in 2016. In 2013, with a flat fare of ¥2.00 (US$0.31) per ride with unlimited transfers on all lines except the Airport Express, the subway was also the most affordable rapid transit system in China. The subway is undergoing rapid expansion and is expected to reach 30 lines, 450 stations, 1,050 kilometres (650 mi) in length by 2022. When fully implemented, 95% of residents inside the Fourth Ring Road will be able to walk to a station in 15 minutes.[233][*better source needed*] The Beijing Suburban Railway provides commuter rail service to outlying suburbs of the municipality.\n\n\nOn 28 December 2014, the Beijing Subway switched to a distance-based fare system from a fixed fare for all lines except the Airport Express.[234] Under the new system a trip under 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) will cost ¥3.00(US$0.49), an additional ¥1.00 will be added for the next 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) and the next 10 km (6 mi) until the distance for the trip reaches 32 km (20 mi).[234] For every 20 kilometres (12 miles) after the original 32 kilometres (20 miles) an additional ¥1.00 is added.[234] For example, a 50-kilometre (31-mile) trip would cost ¥ 8.00.\n\n\nThere are nearly 1,000 public bus and trolleybus lines in the city, including four bus rapid transit lines. Standard bus fares are as low as ¥1.00 when purchased with the *Yikatong* metrocard.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nMetered taxi in Beijing start at ¥13 for the first 3 kilometres (1.9 mi), ¥2.3 Renminbi per additional 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) and ¥1 per ride fuel surcharge, not counting idling fees which are ¥2.3 (¥4.6 during rush hours of 7–9 am and 5–7 pm) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than 12 kilometres per hour (7.5 mph). Most taxis are Hyundai Elantras, Hyundai Sonatas, Peugeots, Citroëns and Volkswagen Jettas. After 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), the base fare increases by 50% (but is only applied to the portion *over* that distance). Different companies have special colours combinations painted on their vehicles. Usually registered taxis have yellowish brown as basic hue, with another color of Prussian blue, hunter green, white, umber, tyrian purple, rufous, or sea green. Between 11 pm and 5 am, there is also a 20% fee increase. Rides over 15 km (9 mi) and between 23:00 and 06:00 incur both charges, for a total increase of 80%. Tolls during trip should be covered by customers and the costs of trips beyond Beijing city limits should be negotiated with the driver. The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver.\n\n\n\n### Bicycles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Huilongguan-Shangdi Bicycle Lane\nBeijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Many cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated bicycle lanes. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient. The rise of electric bicycles and electric scooters, which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes, may have brought about a revival in bicycle-speed two-wheeled transport. It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city. Because of the growing traffic congestion, the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling, but it is not clear whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale.[235] On 30 March 2019, a 6.5 km (4 mile) bicycle-dedicated lane was opened, easing the traffic congestion between Huilongguan and Shangdi where there are many high-tech companies.[236] Cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity spurred by the emergence of a large number of dockless app based bikeshares such as Mobike, Bluegogo and Ofo since 2016.[237]\n\n\n\n## Defence and aerospace[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KJ-2000 and J-10s started the flypast formation on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.\nThe command headquarters of China's military forces are based in Beijing. The Central Military Commission, the political organ in charge of the military, is housed inside the Ministry of National Defense, located next to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in western Beijing. The Rocket Force, which controls the country's strategic missile and nuclear weapons, has its command in Qinghe, Haidian District. The headquarters of the Central Theater Command, one of five nationally, is based further west in Gaojing. The CTR oversees the Beijing Capital Garrison as well as the 81st, 82nd and 83rd Armies, which are based in Hebei.\n\n\nMilitary institutions in Beijing also include academies and thinktanks such as the PLA National Defence University and Academy of Military Science, military hospitals such as the 301, 307 and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and army-affiliated cultural entities such as 1 August Film Studios and the PLA Song and Dance Troupe.\n\n\nThe China National Space Administration, which oversees country's space program, and several space-related state owned companies such as CASTC and CASIC are all based in Beijing. The Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center, in Haidian District tracks the country's crewed and uncrewed flight and other space exploration initiatives.\n\n\n\n## Nature and wildlife[edit]\n\n\nBeijing Municipality has 20 nature reserves that have a total area of 1,339.7 km2 (517.3 sq mi).[238] The mountains to the west and north of the city are home to a number of protected wildlife species including leopard, leopard cat, wolf, red fox, wild boar, masked palm civet, raccoon dog, hog badger, Siberian weasel, Amur hedgehog, roe deer, and mandarin rat snake.[239][240][241] The Beijing Aquatic Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center protects the Chinese giant salamander, Amur stickleback and mandarin duck on the Huaijiu and Huaisha Rivers in Huairou District.[242] The Beijing Milu Park south of the city is home to one of the largest herds of Père David's deer, now extinct in the wild. The Beijing barbastelle, a species of vesper bat discovered in caves of Fangshan District in 2001 and identified as a distinct species in 2007, is endemic to Beijing. The mountains of Fangshan are also habitat for the more common Beijing mouse-eared bat, large myotis, greater horseshoe bat and Rickett's big-footed bat.[243]\n\n\nEach year, Beijing hosts 200–300 species of migratory birds including the common crane, black-headed gull, swan, mallard, common cuckoo and the endangered yellow-breasted bunting.[244][245] In May 2016, Common cuckoos nesting in the wetlands of Cuihu (Haidian), Hanshiqiao (Shunyi), Yeyahu (Yanqing) were tagged and have been traced to far as India, Kenya and Mozambique.[246][247] In the fall of 2016, the Beijing Forest Police undertook a month-long campaign to crack down on illegal hunting and trapping of migratory birds for sale in local bird markets.[245] Over 1,000 rescued birds of protected species including streptopelia, Eurasian siskin, crested myna, coal tit and great tit were handed to the Beijing Wildlife Protection and Rescue Center for repatriation to the wild.[245][248]\n\n\nThe city flowers are the Chinese rose and chrysanthemum.[249] The city trees are the Chinese arborvitae, an evergreen in the cypress family and the pagoda tree, also called the Chinese scholar tree, a deciduous tree of the family Fabaceae.[249] The oldest scholar tree in the city was planted in what is now Beihai Park during the Tang dynasty.[250]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nThe capital is the home of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral development bank that aims to improve economic and social outcomes in Asia[251] and the Silk Road Fund, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.[252] Beijing is also home to the headquarters of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),[253] making it an important city for international diplomacy.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in China\n\nBeijing is twinned with the following regions, cities, and counties:[254]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n* ![](image) Ankara, Turkey\n* ![](image) Astana, Kazakhstan\n* ![](image) Athens, Greece\n* ![](image) Bangkok, Thailand\n* ![](image) Berlin, Germany\n* ![](image) Brussels, Belgium\n* ![](image) Bucharest, Romania\n* ![](image) Budapest, Hungary\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina\n* ![](image) Cairo, Egypt\n* ![](image) Canberra, Australia\n* ![](image) Cologne, Germany\n* ![](image) Copenhagen, Denmark\n* ![](image) Delhi, India\n* ![](image) Doha, Qatar\n* ![](image) Dublin, Ireland\n* ![](image) Hanoi, Vietnam\n* ![](image) Havana, Cuba\n* ![](image) Île-de-France, France\n* ![](image) Islamabad, Pakistan\n* ![](image) Jakarta, Indonesia\n* ![](image) Johannesburg, South Africa\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine\n* ![](image) Lima, Peru\n* ![](image) London, England, United Kingdom\n* ![](image) Manila, Philippines\n* ![](image) Minsk, Belarus\n* ![](image) Mexico City, Mexico\n* ![](image) Moscow, Russia\n* ![](image) New York City, United States\n* ![](image) Ottawa, Canada\n* ![](image) Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n* ![](image) Riga, Latvia\n* ![](image) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n* ![](image) San José, Costa Rica\n* ![](image) Santiago, Chile\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![Estonia](image) Tallinn, Estonia\n* ![](image) Tehran, Iran\n* ![](image) Tel Aviv, Israel\n* ![](image) Tirana, Albania\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan\n* ![](image) Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\n* ![](image) Vientiane, Laos\n* ![](image) Washington D.C., United States\n* ![](image) Wellington, New Zealand\n\n### Foreign embassies and consulates[edit]\n\n\nSee also: list of diplomatic missions in China\nIn 2019, China had the largest diplomatic network in the world.[255] China hosts a large diplomatic community in its capital city of Beijing.

With over 21 million residents, Beijing is the world's most populous national capital city as well as China's second largest city after Shanghai.[9] It is located in Northern China, and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.[10] Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin to the southeast; together, the three divisions form the Jingjinji megalopolis and the national capital region of China.[11]\n\n\nBeijing is a global city and one of the world's leading centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport, science and technology and transportation. As a megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai.[12] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets.[13] It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[14] and, as of 2016[update], the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world. The Beijing Daxing International Airport, which is the second international airport in Beijing, is the largest single-structure airport terminal in the world.[15][16]\n\n\nCombining both modern and traditional style architectures, Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich history dating back over three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries,[17] and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium CE.[18] With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates.[19] Beijing is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world. In 2018, Beijing was the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[20] Beijing is home to many national monuments and museums and has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites—the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, and parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal—all of which are popular tourist locations.[21] Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing.\n\n\nBeijing's public universities make up more than one-fifth of Double First-Class Universities, and many of them consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world.[22][23][24] Beijing is home to the two best C9 League universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in Asia & Oceania region and emerging countries.[25][26] Beijing CBD is a center for Beijing's economic expansion, with the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers. Beijing's Zhongguancun area is a world leading center of scientific and technological innovation as well as entrepreneurship. Beijing has been ranked the city with the largest scientific research output by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][28] The city has hosted numerous international and national sporting events, the most notable being the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games. In 2022, Beijing became the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics,[29] and also the Summer and Winter Paralympics.[30] Beijing hosts 175 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many organizations, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Silk Road Fund, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, and the Red Cross Society of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Beijing\n\nOver the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had numerous other names. The name *Beijing*, which means \"Northern Capital\" (from the Chinese characters 北 *běi* for *north* and 京 *jīng* for *capital*), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the \"Southern Capital\").[31] The English spelling *Beijing* is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. An older English spelling, *Peking*, was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.[32] Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA code PEK, and Peking University, still retain the former romanization.\n\n\nThe single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is 京, which appears on automobile license plates in the city. The official Latin alphabet abbreviation for Beijing is \"BJ\".[33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Beijing\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest traces of human habitation in the Peking municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. *Homo erectus* fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic *Homo sapiens* also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago.[34] Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in central Peking.\n\n\nThe first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng, the capital city of the state of Ji which was built in 1045 BC. Within modern Beijing, Jicheng was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District.[35] This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital.[36]\n\n\n\n### Early Imperial China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Tianning Pagoda, built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty\nAfter the First Emperor unified China in 221 BC, Jicheng became a prefectural capital and[37] during the Three Kingdoms period, it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to the Wei Kingdom of Cao Cao. The AD third-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu, Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom.[38]\n\n\nAfter China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581, Jicheng, also known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal. Under the Tang dynasty, Jicheng as Youzhou, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the \"Yan Capital.\" Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the frontier territory including what is now Beijing to the Khitan Liao dynasty, which treated the city as Nanjing, or the \"Southern Capital\", one of four secondary capitals to complement its \"Supreme Capital\" Shangjing (modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia). Some of the oldest surviving pagodas in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the Tianning Pagoda.\n\n\nThe Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122, which gave the city to the Song dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China. In 1153, the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their \"Central Capital\", or Zhongdu.[37] The city was besieged by Genghis Khan's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later.[39] Two generations later, Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as Khanbaliq), a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins. The construction took from 1264 to 1293,[37][39][40] but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper. The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present-day Chang'an Avenue to the northern part of Line 10 subway. Remnants of the Yuan rammed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng.[41]\n\n\n\n### Ming dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the corner towers of the Forbidden City, built by the Yongle Emperor during the early Ming dynasty\nIn 1368, soon after declaring the new Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty, the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang captured Dadu/Khanbaliq and razed the Yuan palaces to the ground.[42] Since the Yuan continued to occupy Shangdu and Mongolia, Dadu was used to supply the Ming military garrisons in the area and renamed Beiping (Wade–Giles: Peip'ing, \"Northern Peace\").[43] Under the Hongwu Emperor's feudal policies, Beiping was given to his son Zhu Di, who was created \"Prince of Yan\".\n\n![](image)Overlapping layout of Beijing during the Liao, Jin, Yuan and Ming dynasties\nThe early death of Zhu Yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle upon his death, one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (modern Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital. The city of Beiping became Beijing (\"Northern Capital\") or Shuntian[44] in 1403.[31] The construction of the new imperial residence, the Forbidden City, took from 1406 to 1420;[39] this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven[45] and Tian'anmen. On 28 October 1420, the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed.[46] Beijing became the empire's primary capital, and Yingtian, also called Nanjing (\"Southern Capital\"), became the co-capital. (A 1425 order by Zhu Di's son, the Hongxi Emperor, to return the primary capital to Nanjing was never carried out: he died, probably of a heart attack, the next month. He was buried, like almost every Ming emperor to follow him, in an elaborate necropolis to Beijing's north.)\n\n\nBy the 15th century, Beijing had essentially taken its current shape. The Ming city wall continued to serve until modern times, when it was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place.[47] It is generally believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world for most of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.[48] The first known church was constructed by Catholics in 1652 at the former site of Matteo Ricci's chapel; the modern Nantang Cathedral was later built upon the same site.[49]\n\n\nThe capture of Beijing by Li Zicheng's peasant army in 1644 ended the dynasty, but he and his Shun court abandoned the city without a fight when the Manchu army of Prince Dorgon arrived 40 days later.\n\n\n\n### Qing dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer Palace is one of the several palatial gardens built by Qing emperors in the northwest suburb area.\nDorgon established the Qing dynasty as a direct successor of the Ming (delegitimising Li Zicheng and his followers)[50] and Beijing became China's sole capital.[51] The Qing emperors made some modifications to the Imperial residence but, in large part, the Ming buildings and the general layout remained unchanged. Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced, but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals. Signage was bilingual or Chinese. This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the Chinese novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Northwest of the city, Qing emperors built several large palatial gardens including the Old Summer Palace and the Summer Palace.\n\n\nDuring the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces captured the outskirts of the city, looting and burning the Old Summer Palace in 1860. Under the Convention of Peking[a] ending that war, Western powers for the first time secured the right to establish permanent diplomatic presences within the city. From 14 to 15 August 1900 the Battle of Peking was fought. This battle was part of the Boxer Rebellion. \nThe attempt by the Boxers to eradicate this presence, as well as Chinese Christian converts, led to Beijing's reoccupation by eight foreign powers.[54] During the fighting, several important structures were destroyed, including the Hanlin Academy and the (new) Summer Palace.\nA peace agreement was concluded between the Eight-Nation Alliance and representatives of the Chinese government Li Hongzhang and Yikuang on 7 September 1901. The treaty required China to pay an indemnity of US$335 million (over US$4 billion in current dollars) plus interest over a period of 39 years. Also required was the execution or exile of government supporters of the Boxers and the destruction of Chinese forts and other defenses in much of northern China. Ten days after the treaty was signed the foreign armies left Beijing, although legation guards would remain there until World War II.[55]\n\n\nWith the treaty signed the Empress Dowager Cixi returned to Beijing from her \"tour of inspection\" on 7 January 1902 and the rule of the Qing dynasty over China was restored, albeit much weakened by the defeat it had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and by the indemnity and stipulations of the peace treaty.[56] The Dowager died in 1908 and the dynasty imploded in 1911.\n\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A large portrait of Chiang Kai-shek was displayed above Tiananmen after WWII.\nThe fomenters of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like Sun Yat-sen originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later[57] left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. Following the success of the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, the capital was formally moved to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as \"Peiping\").[12][58]\n\n\nOn 7 July 1937, the 29th Army and the Japanese army in China exchanged fire at the Marco Polo Bridge near the Wanping Fortress southwest of the city. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II as it is known in China. During the war,[12] Beijing fell to Japan on 29 July 1937[59] and was made the seat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state that ruled the ethnic-Chinese portions of Japanese-occupied northern China.[60] This government was later merged into the larger Wang Jingwei government based in Nanjing.[61]\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tiananmen during People's Republic of China\nIn the final phases of the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army seized control of the city peacefully on 31 January 1949 in the course of the Pingjin Campaign. On 1 October that year, Mao Zedong announced the creation of the People's Republic of China from atop Tian'anmen. He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing,[62] a decision that had been reached by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference just a few days earlier.\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in the west and residential neighborhoods in the north. Many areas of the Beijing city wall were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the Beijing Subway and the 2nd Ring Road.\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the Red Guard movement began in Beijing and the city's government fell victim to one of the first purges. By the autumn of 1966, all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tian'anmen Square with Mao.[63] In April 1976, a large public gathering of Beijing residents against the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution in Tiananmen Square was forcefully suppressed. In October 1976, the Gang was arrested in Zhongnanhai and the Cultural Revolution came to an end. In December 1978, the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress in Beijing under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping reversed the verdicts against victims of the Cultural Revolution and instituted the \"policy of reform and opening up.\"\n\n\nSince the early 1980s, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Ring Roads.[64][65] According to one 2005 newspaper report, the size of newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times larger than before.[66] Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing shopping districts,[67] while Zhongguancun has become a major center of electronics in China.[68] In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as heavy traffic, poor air quality, the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed rural areas of the country.[69] Beijing has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.[70] The city has also hosted major international events, including the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.[71]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Beijing\n\nBeijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular North China Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially Yanqing District and Huairou District, are dominated by the Jundu Mountains, while the western part is framed by *Xishan* or the Western Hills. The Great Wall of China across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling, in the Western Hills and on the border with Hebei, is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of 2,303 metres (7,556 ft).\n\n\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the Chaobai, Yongding, Juma, are all tributaries in the Hai River system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the Grand Canal to Hangzhou, which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the South–North Water Transfer Project, constructed in the past decade to bring water from the Yangtze River basin.\n\n\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of 40 to 60 metres (130–200 feet), occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric ring roads. The Second Ring Road traces the old city walls and the Sixth Ring Road connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. Tian'anmen and Tian'anmen Square are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the Forbidden City, the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai, the residence of China's current leaders. Chang'an Avenue, which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east–west axis.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of the Forbidden City, viewed from the Jingshan Park\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The North-South Central Axis of Beijing City\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Beijing\n\nThree styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the Forbidden City, the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.[72] Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the Beijing CBD in east Beijing such as the new CCTV Headquarters, in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the Beijing National Stadium and National Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the CTBUH Skyscraper Award for best overall tall building twice, for the Linked Hybrid building in 2009 and the CCTV Headquarters in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\n\n\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and neofuturistic style of architecture can be seen at the 798 Art Zone, which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's tallest building is the 528-meter China Zun.\n\n\n\n![](image)Wangjing SOHO\nBeijing is famous for its *siheyuans*, a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching-ling. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called *hutongs*. The *hutongs* are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, *siheyuans* and *hutongs* are rapidly disappearing,[73] as entire city blocks of *hutongs* are replaced by high-rise buildings.[74] Residents of the *hutongs* are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community and street life of the *hutongs* cannot be replaced,[75] and these properties are often government owned.[76]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing average annual temperatures from 1970 to 2019 during summer (June, July, and August) and winter (December, January, and February). Weather station data from NOAA. For comparison the Global Surface Temperature Anomaly rose by approximately one degree over the same time period. Beijing has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: *Dwa*), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: *BSk*) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cwa*), characterized by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and brief but cold, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone.[77] Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn, similar to spring, is a season of transition and minimal precipitation. The monthly daily average temperature in January is −3.5 °C (25.7 °F), while in July it is 26.8 °C (80.2 °F). Precipitation averages around 577 mm (23 in) annually, with close to three-quarters of that total falling from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47% in July to 65% in January and February, the city receives 2,455 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from −27.4 °C (−17.3 °F) on 22 February 1966 to 41.9 °C (107.4 °F) on 24 July 1999 (unofficial record of 42.6 °C (108.7 °F) was set on 15 June 1942).[78][79]\n\n\n| Climate data for Beijing (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1951–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −2.7(27.1)\n | 0.6(33.1)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | −1.0(30.2)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | −5.0(23.0)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −22.8(−9.0)\n | −27.4(−17.3)\n | −15(5)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | −3.5(25.7)\n | −12.3(9.9)\n | −18.3(−0.9)\n | −27.4(−17.3)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 5.8(0.23)\n | 8.6(0.34)\n | 21.7(0.85)\n | 36.1(1.42)\n | 72.4(2.85)\n | 169.7(6.68)\n | 113.4(4.46)\n | 53.7(2.11)\n | 28.7(1.13)\n | 13.5(0.53)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 528(20.78)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 1.6\n | 2.3\n | 3.0\n | 4.7\n | 6.0\n | 10.0\n | 11.9\n | 10.5\n | 7.1\n | 5.2\n | 2.9\n | 1.6\n | 66.8\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 2.8\n | 2.5\n | 1.3\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 1.7\n | 2.8\n | 11.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 43\n | 42\n | 40\n | 43\n | 47\n | 58\n | 69\n | 71\n | 64\n | 58\n | 54\n | 46\n | 53\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 188.1\n | 189.1\n | 231.1\n | 243.2\n | 265.1\n | 221.6\n | 190.5\n | 205.3\n | 206.1\n | 199.9\n | 173.4\n | 177.1\n | 2,490.5\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 62\n | 62\n | 62\n | 61\n | 59\n | 50\n | 42\n | 49\n | 56\n | 59\n | 59\n | 61\n | 57\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 5\n |\n| Source 1: China Meteorological Administration[80][81] |\n| Source 2: Extremes[b] and Weather Atlas[85] |\n\n#### Note[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** When Europeans first came into sustained contact with China, \"Pekin\" and \"Peking\" were the most popular ways of romanizing the name of Beijing.[52][53]\n2. **^** All-time record high;[79] February record high;[82] May record high;[83] June record high[84]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

For example, surface albedo, wind speed and humidity near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface air temperatures, vertical air dilution and ozone levels were increased.[87] Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel, Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to health issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy smog struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, impacting a total of 600 million people. After this \"pollution shock\" air pollution became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.[88]\n\n\n\n#### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nJoint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35–60% of the ozone can be traced to sources outside the city. Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a \"significant influence on Beijing's air quality\",[89] partly due to the prevailing south/southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest.\n\n\nIn preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics and to fulfill promises to clean up the city's air, nearly US$17 billion was spent.[90] Beijing implemented a number of air improvement schemes for the duration of the Games, including halting work at all construction sites, closing many factories in Beijing permanently, temporarily shutting industry in neighboring regions, closing some gas stations,[91] and cutting motor traffic by half by limiting drivers to odd or even days (based on their license plate numbers),[92] reducing bus and subway fares, opening new subway lines, and banning high-emission vehicles.[93][94] The city further assembled 3,800 natural gas-powered buses, one of the largest fleets in the world.[90] Beijing became the first city in China to require the Chinese equivalent to the Euro 4 emission standard.[95]\n\n\nCoal burning accounts for about 40% of the PM 2.5 in Beijing and is also the chief source of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide.[96] Since 2012, the city has been converting coal-fired power stations to burn natural gas[97] and aims to cap annual coal consumption at 20 million tons. In 2011, the city burned 26.3 million tons of coal, 73% of which for heating and power generation and the remainder for industry.[97] Much of the city's air pollutants are emitted by neighboring regions.[96] Coal consumption in neighboring Tianjin is expected to increase from 48 to 63 million tons from 2011 to 2015.[98] Hebei Province burned over 300 million tons of coal in 2011, more than all of Germany, of which only 30% were used for power generation and a considerable portion for steel and cement making.[99] Power plants in the coal-mining regions of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, where coal consumption has tripled since 2000, and Shandong also contribute to air pollution in Beijing.[96] Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, respectively rank from first to fourth, among Chinese provinces by coal consumption.[98] There were four major coal-fired power plants in the city to provide electricity as well as heating during the winter. The first one (Gaojing Thermal Power Plant) was shut down in 2014.[100] Another two were shut in March 2015. The last one (Huaneng Thermal Power Plant) would be shut in 2016.[101] Between 2013 and 2017, the city planned to reduce 13 million tons of coal consumption and cap coal consumption to 15 million tons in 2015.[101]\n\n\nThe government sometimes uses cloud-seeding measures to increase the likelihood of rain showers in the region to clear the air prior to large events, such as prior to the 60th anniversary parade in 2009 as well as to combat drought conditions in the area.[102] More recently, however, the government has increased its usage of such measures as closing factories temporarily and implementing greater restrictions for cars on the road, as in the case of \"APEC blue\" and \"parade blue,\" short periods during and immediately preceding the APEC China 2014 and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, respectively.[103] During and prior to these events, Beijing's air quality improved dramatically, only to fall back to unhealthy levels shortly after.\n\n\nBeijing air quality is often poor, especially in winter. In mid-January 2013, Beijing's air quality was measured on top of the city's US embassy at a PM2.5 density of 755 micrograms per cubic meter, which is more than 75 times the safe level established by the WHO, and went off the US Environmental Protection Agency's air quality index. It was widely reported, originally through a Twitter account, that the category was \"crazy bad\". This was later changed to \"beyond index\".[104]\n\n\nOn 8 and 9 December 2015 Beijing had its first smog alert which shut down a majority of the industry and other commercial businesses in the city.[105] Later in the month another smog \"red alert\" was issued.[106]\n\n\nAccording to Beijing's environmental protection bureau's announcement in November 2016, starting from 2017 highly polluting old cars will be banned from being driven whenever Smog \"red alerts\" are issued in the city or neighboring regions.[107]\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been measurable reductions in pollutants after the \"war on pollution\" was declared in 2014, with Beijing seeing a 35% reduction in fine particulates in 2017[108] and further reduction by 2020.[109]: 52\n\n\n\n### Readings[edit]\n\n\nDue to Beijing's high level of air pollution, there are various readings by different sources on the subject. Daily pollution readings at 27 monitoring stations around the city are reported on the website of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB).[110] The American Embassy of Beijing also reports hourly fine particulate (PM2.5) and ozone levels on Twitter.[111] Since the BJEPB and US Embassy measure different pollutants according to different criteria, the pollution levels and the impact to human health reported by the BJEPB are often lower than that reported by the US Embassy.[111]\n\n\nThe smog is causing harm and danger to the population. The air pollution does directly result in significant impact on the mobility rate of cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease in Beijing.[112] Exposure to large concentrations of polluted air can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, emergency room visits, and even death.[113]\n\n\n\n#### Dust storms[edit]\n\n\nDust from the erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city; the Beijing Weather Modification Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects.[114] In the first four months of 2006 alone, there were no fewer than eight such storms.[115] In April 2002, one dust storm alone dumped nearly 50,000 tons of dust onto the city before moving on to Japan and Korea.[116]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Beijing\n\nThe municipal government is regulated by the local Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by the Beijing CCP Secretary (Chinese: 中共北京市委书记). The local CCP issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\n\n\nGovernment officials include the mayor (Chinese: 市长) and vice-mayor. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs. Additionally, as the capital of China, Beijing houses all of the important national governmental and political institutions, including the National People's Congress.[117]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Beijing and List of township-level divisions of Beijing.\n\nBeijing Municipality currently comprises 16 administrative county-level subdivisions including 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. On 1 July 2010, Chongwen and Xuanwu were merged into Dongcheng and Xicheng, respectively. On 13 November 2015 Miyun and Yanqing were upgraded to districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Beijing** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Dongcheng**\n\n**Xicheng**\n\n**Chaoyang**\n\n**Fengtai**\n\n**Shijingshan**\n\n**Haidian**\n\n**Mentougou**\n\n**Fangshan**\n\n**Tongzhou**\n\n**Shunyi**\n\n**Changping**\n\n**Daxing**\n\n**Huairou**\n\n**Pinggu**\n\n**Miyun**\n\n**Yanqing**\n |\n| Division code[118] | Division\n | Area in km2[119] | Total population 2010[120] | Urban areapopulation 2010[121] | Seat\n | Postal code\n | Subdivisions[122][*full citation needed*] |\n| Subdistricts | Towns | Townships[n 1] | Residential communities | Villages |\n| 110000 | Beijing\n | 16406.16 | 19,612,368 | 16,858,692 | Dongcheng / Tongzhou | 100000 | 149 | 143 | 38 | 2538 | 3857\n |\n| 110101 | Dongcheng | 41.82 | 919,253 | Jingshan Subdistrict | 100000 | 17 |  |  | 216 |  |\n| 110102 | Xicheng | 50.33 | 1,243,315 | Jinrong Street Subdistrict | 100000 | 15 |  |  | 259 |  |\n| 110105 | Chaoyang | 454.78 | 3,545,137 | 3,532,257 | Chaowai Subdistrict | 100000 | 24 |  | 19 | 358 | 5\n |\n| 110106 | Fengtai | 305.53 | 2,112,162 | 2,098,632 | Fengtai Subdistrict | 100000 | 16 | 2 | 3 | 254 | 73\n |\n| 110107 | Shijingshan | 84.38 | 616,083 | Lugu Subdistrict | 100000 | 9 |  |  | 130 |  |\n| 110108 | Haidian | 430.77 | 3,280,670 | 3,208,563 | Haidian Subdistrict | 100000 | 22 | 7 |  | 603 | 84\n |\n| 110109 | Mentougou | 1447.85 | 290,476 | 248,547 | Dayu Subdistrict | 102300 | 4 | 9 |  | 124 | 179\n |\n| 110111 | Fangshan | 1994.73 | 944,832 | 635,282 | Gongchen Subdistrict | 102400 | 8 | 14 | 6 | 108 | 462\n |\n| 110112 | Tongzhou | 905.79 | 1,184,256 | 724,228 | Beiyuan Subdistrict | 101100 | 6 | 10 | 1 | 40 | 480\n |\n| 110113 | Shunyi | 1019.51 | 876,620 | 471,459 | Shengli Subdistrict | 101300 | 6 | 19 |  | 61 | 449\n |\n| 110114 | Changping | 1342.47 | 1,660,501 | 1,310,617 | Chengbei Subdistrict | 102200 | 8 | 14 |  | 180 | 303\n |\n| 110115 | Daxing | 1036.34 | 1,365,112 | 965,683 | Xingfeng Subdistrict | 102600 | 5 | 14 |  | 64 | 547\n |\n| 110116 | Huairou | 2122.82 | 372,887 | 253,088 | Longshan Subdistrict | 101400 | 2 | 12 | 2 | 27 | 286\n |\n| 110117 | Pinggu | 948.24 | 415,958 | 219,850 | Binhe Subdistrict | 101200 | 2 | 14 | 2 | 23 | 275\n |\n| 110118 | Miyun | 2225.92 | 467,680 | 257,449 | Gulou Subdistrict | 101500 | 2 | 17 | 1 | 57 | 338\n |\n| 110119 | Yanqing | 1994.89 | 317,426 | 154,386 | Rulin Subdistrict | 102100 | 3 | 11 | 4 | 34 | 376\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Divisions in Chinese\n |\n| --- |\n| English\n | Chinese\n | Pinyin\n |\n| Beijing Municipality\n | 北京市 | Běijīng Shì\n |\n| Dongcheng District | 东城区 | Dōngchéng Qū\n |\n| Xicheng District | 西城区 | Xīchéng Qū\n |\n| Chaoyang District | 朝阳区 | Cháoyáng Qū\n |\n| Fengtai District | 丰台区 | Fēngtái Qū\n |\n| Shijingshan District | 石景山区 | Shíjǐngshān Qū\n |\n| Haidian District | 海淀区 | Hǎidiàn Qū\n |\n| Mentougou District | 门头沟区 | Méntóugōu Qū\n |\n| Fangshan District | 房山区 | Fángshān Qū\n |\n| Tongzhou District | 通州区 | Tōngzhōu Qū\n |\n| Shunyi District | 顺义区 | Shùnyì Qū\n |\n| Changping District | 昌平区 | Chāngpíng Qū\n |\n| Daxing District | 大兴区 | Dàxīng Qū\n |\n| Huairou District | 怀柔区 | Huáiróu Qū\n |\n| Pinggu District | 平谷区 | Pínggǔ Qū\n |\n| Miyun District | 密云区 | Mìyún Qū\n |\n| Yanqing District | 延庆区 | Yánqìng Qū\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Including Ethnic townships & other township related subdivisions.\n\n#### Towns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of township-level divisions of Beijing\n\nBeijing's 16 county-level divisions (districts) are further subdivided into 273 lower third-level administrative units at the township level: 119 towns, 24 townships, 5 ethnic townships and 125 subdistricts.\nTowns within Beijing Municipality but outside the urban area include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n* Changping 昌平\n* Huairou 怀柔\n* Miyun 密云\n* Liangxiang 良乡\n* Liulimiao 琉璃庙\n* Tongzhou 通州\n* Yizhuang 亦庄\n* Tiantongyuan 天通苑\n* Beiyuan 北苑\n* Xiaotangshan 小汤山\n\nSeveral place names in Beijing end with *mén* (门), meaning \"gate\", as they were the locations of gates in the former Beijing city wall. Other place names end in *cūn* (村), meaning \"village\", as they were originally villages outside the city wall.\n\n\n\n### Judiciary and procuracy[edit]\n\n\nThe judicial system in Beijing consists of the Supreme People's Court, the highest court in the country, the Beijing Municipal High People's Court, the high people's court of the municipality, three intermediate people's courts, one intermediate railway transport court, 14 basic people's court (one for each of the municipality's districts and counties), and one basic railway transport court. The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in Shijingshan oversees the basic courts of Haidian, Shijingshan, Mentougou, Changping and Yanqing.[123] The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court in Fengtai oversees the basic courts of Dongcheng, Xicheng, Fengtai, Fangshan and Daxing.[123] The Beijing No. 3 Intermediate People's Court in Laiguangying, is the newest of the three intermediate people's courts and opened on 21 August 2013.[123] It oversees the district courts of Chaoyang, Tongzhou, Shunyi, Huairou, Pinggu and Miyun.[123][124] Each court in Beijing has a corresponding people's procuratorate.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Beijing\n\n![](image)Beijing products treemap, 2020\nAs of 2022[update], Beijing's nominal GDP was CN¥4.16 trillion ($619 billion in nominal, $1.016 trillion in PPP), about 3.44% of the country's GDP and ranked 13th among province-level administrative units; its nominal GDP per capita was US$28,258 (CN¥190,059) and ranked the 1st in the country.[3][125] It also ranks the tenth largest in the metropolitan economies in the world.[126] Beijing's nominal GDP is projected to reach US$1.1 trillion in 2035, ranking among the world's top 10 largest cities (together with Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in China) according to a study by Oxford Economics,[127] and its nominal GDP per capita will reach US$45,000 in 2030.[128]\n\n\nDue to the concentration of state owned enterprises in the national capital, Beijing in 2013 had more Fortune Global 500 Company headquarters than any other city in the world.[129] As of August 2022, Beijing has 54 Fortune Global 500 companies, more than Japan (47), the third-place country after China (145) and the United States (124).[130][131] Beijing has also been described as the \"billionaire capital of the world\".[132][133] In 2020, Beijing is the fifth wealthiest city in the world, with a total wealth amounts to $2 trillion.[134] Beijing is classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and worldwide and making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[135] In the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index, Beijing was ranked as having the sixth-most competitive financial center in the world and fourth-most competitive in the whole Asia & Oceania region (behind Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore).[136]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Beijing was ranked first globally in terms of \"*Global City Competitiveness*\" in the *2020–2021 Global Urban Competitiveness Report* jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the United Nations Programme for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat).[137]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical GDP of Beijing for 1978–present (SNA2008)[138]

GDP is based on mid-year population.\n\n\n\n### Sector composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Taikoo Li Sanlitun shopping arcade is a destination for locals and visitors.\nThe city has a post-industrial economy that is dominated by the tertiary sector (services), which generated 83.8% of output, followed by the secondary sector (manufacturing, construction) at 15.8% and the primary sector (agriculture, mining) at 0.26%.[3] The services sector is broadly diversified with professional services, wholesale and retail, information technology, commercial real estate, scientific research, and residential real estate each contributing at least 6% to the city's economy in 2022.[3][140]\n\n\nThe single largest sub-sector remains industry, whose share of overall output has shrunk to 12.1% in 2022.[3] The mix of industrial output has changed significantly since 2010 when the city announced that 140 highly-polluting, energy and water resource intensive enterprises would be relocated from the city in five years.[141] The relocation of Capital Steel to neighboring Hebei province had begun in 2005.[142][143] In 2013, output of automobiles, aerospace products, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and food processing all increased.[140]\n\n\nIn the farmland around Beijing, vegetables and fruits have displaced grain as the primary crops under cultivation.[140] In 2013, the tonnage of vegetable, edible fungus and fruit harvested was over three times that of grain.[140] In 2013, overall acreage under cultivation shrank along with most categories of produce as more land was reforested for environmental reasons.[140]\n\n\n\n### Economic zones[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of economic and technological development zones in Beijing.\n\n![](image)The skyline of Beijing CBD\n![](image)Zhongguancun is a technology hub in Haidian District.\nIn 2006, the city government identified six high-end economic output zones around Beijing as the primary engines for local economic growth. In 2012, the six zones produced 43.3% of the city's GDP, up from 36.5% in 2007.[144][145]\nThe six zones are:\n\n\n\n1. Zhongguancun, China's silicon village in Haidian District northwest of the city, is home to both established and start-up tech companies. In the first two quarters of 2014, 9,895 companies registered in the six zones, among which 6,150 were based in Zhongguancun.[146] Zhongguancun is also the center of Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Hi-Tech Industrial Belt.\n2. Beijing Financial Street, in Xicheng District on the west side of the city between Fuxingmen and Fuchengmen, is lined with headquarters of large state banks and insurance companies. The country's financial regulatory agencies including the central bank, bank regulator, securities regulator, and foreign exchange authority are located in the neighborhood.\n3. Beijing Central Business District (CBD), is actually located to the east of downtown, near the embassies along the eastern Third Ring Road between Jianguomenwai and Chaoyangmenwai. The CBD is home to most of the city's skyscraper office buildings. Most of the city's foreign companies and professional service firms are based in the CBD.\n4. Beijing Economic and Technological Development Area, better known as Yizhuang, is an industrial park the straddles the southern Fifth Ring Road in Daxing District. It has attracted pharmaceutical, information technology, and materials engineering companies.[147]\n5. Beijing Airport Economic Zone was created in 1993 and surrounds the Beijing Capital International Airport in Shunyi District northeast of the city. In addition to logistics, airline services, and trading firms, this zone is also home to Beijing's automobile assembly plants.\n6. Beijing Olympic Center Zone surrounds the Olympic Green due north of downtown and is developing into an entertainment, sports, tourism and business convention center.\n\n\nShijingshan, on the western outskirts of the city, is a traditional heavy industrial base for steel-making.[148] Chemical plants are concentrated in the far eastern suburbs.\n\n\nLess legitimate enterprises also exist. Urban Beijing is known for being a center of infringed goods; anything from the latest designer clothing to DVDs can be found in markets all over the city, often marketed to expatriates and international visitors.[149]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Beijing\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1953 | 2,768,149 | —     |\n| 1964 | 7,568,495 | +9.57% |\n| 1982 | 9,230,687 | +1.11% |\n| 1990 | 10,819,407 | +2.00% |\n| 2000 | 13,569,194 | +2.29% |\n| 2010 | 19,612,368 | +3.75% |\n| 2020[138] | 21,893,095 | +1.11% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes on administrative divisions. |\n\n\nIn 2021, Beijing had a total population of 21.89 million within the municipality, of which 19.16 million (87.5 percent) resided in urban districts or suburban townships and 2.73 million (12.5) lived in rural villages.[3] The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010[update], a population of 24.9 million.[150][151]\n\n\nWithin China, the city ranked second in urban population after Shanghai and the third in municipal population after Shanghai and Chongqing. Beijing also ranks among the most populous cities in the world, a distinction the city has held for much of the past 800 years, especially during the 15th to early 19th centuries when it was the largest city in the world.\n\n\nAbout 13 million of the city's residents in 2013 had local *hukou* permits, which entitles them to permanent residence in Beijing.[140] The remaining 8 million residents had *hukou* permits elsewhere and were not eligible to receive some social benefits provided by the Beijing municipal government.[140]\n\n\nThe population increased in 2013 by 455,000 or about 7% from the previous year and continued a decade-long trend of rapid growth.[140] The total population in 2004 was 14.213 million.[152] The population gains are driven largely by migration. The population's rate of natural increase in 2013 was a mere 0.441%, based on a birth rate of 8.93 and a mortality rate of 4.52.[140] The gender balance was 51.6% males and 48.4% females.[140]\n\n\nWorking age people account for nearly 73.6% of the population.[3] Compared to 2004, residents age 0–14 as a proportion of the population dropped from 9.95% to 9.92% in 2013, but again increased to 12.1% in 2021.[3]\nResidents over the age of 65 declined from 11.12% to 8.58%, but increased to 14.2% in 2021.[3] From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of city residents with at least some college education nearly doubled, from 20.4% to 37.3%, and further increased to 49.1% by 2021.[3] About 66.4% have senior secondary school education and 88.2% had reached middle school.[3]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, nearly 96% of Beijing's population are ethnic Han Chinese.[153] Of the 800,000 ethnic minority population living in the capital, Manchu (336,000), Hui (249,000), Korean (77,000), Mongol (37,000) and Tujia (24,000) constitute the five largest groups.[154] In addition, there were 8,045 Hong Kong residents, 500 Macau residents, and 7,772 Taiwan residents along with 91,128 registered foreigners living in Beijing.[153] A study by the Beijing Academy of Sciences estimates that in 2010 there were on average 200,000 foreigners living in Beijing on any given day including students, business travellers and tourists that are not counted as registered residents.[155]\n\n\nIn 2017 the Chinese government implemented population controls for Beijing and Shanghai to fight what it called the \"big city disease\" which includes congestion, pollution, and shortages of education and health care services. From this policy, Beijing's population declined by 20,000 from 2016 to 2017.[156] Some low-income people are being forcibly removed from the city as both legal and illegal housing is being demolished in some high-density residential neighborhoods.[156] The population is being redistributed to Jing-Jin-Ji and Xiong'an New Area, the transfer to the latter expected to include 300,000-500,000 people working in government research, universities, and corporate headquarters.[157][158]\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Beijing, Education in China, and Higher education in China\n\nSee also: Rankings of universities in China, List of universities in China, and Double First Class University Plan\nBeijing is a world leading center for scientific and technological innovation and has been ranked the No.1 city in the world with the largest scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][159][28] The city is also leading the world with the highest share of articles published in the fields of physical sciences, chemistry, and earth and environmental sciences, especially in the United Nations'17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related output.[160][161][162][163]\n\n\nBeijing has over 90 public colleges and universities, which is the largest urban public university system in Asia and the first city in China with most higher education institutions,[164][165] and it is home to the two best universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in the whole of Asia-Oceania region and emerging countries with its shared rankings at 16th place in the world by the 2022 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[166][167][26] Both are members of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.[168]\n\n\nBeijing also has the highest number of universities of any city in the country, representing more than one-fifth of 147 Double First-Class Universities, a national plan to develop elite Chinese universities into world-class institutions by the end of 2050.[169] A number of Beijing's most prestigious universities consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, Beijing Normal University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beihang University, Beijing Institute of Technology, China Agricultural University, Minzu University of China, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, University of International Business and Economics, University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Central University of Finance and Economics.[170][22][171][172] These universities were selected as \"985 universities\" or \"211 universities\" by the Chinese government in order to build world-class universities.[173][174]\n\n\nThe city is a seat of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has been consistently ranked the No.1 research institute in the world by *Nature Index* since the list's inception in 2014, by Nature Research.[175][176][177] The academy also runs the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is located in Beijing and ranked among the world's top five research institutions by the Nature Index.[178] Beijing is also a site of Chinese Academy of Engineering, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n\n\nSome of the national key universities in Beijing are:\n\n* Beijing Forestry University\n* Beijing Jiaotong University\n* Beijing University of Technology\n* Beijing University of Chinese Medicine\n* Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications\n* Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute\n*

High-level Tibetan Buddhism College of China [zh] (中国藏语系高级佛学院)\n* National Seminary of Catholic Church in China (中国天主教神哲学院)\n\nThe city's compulsory education system is among the best in the world: in 2018, 15-year-old students from Beijing (together with Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu) outperformed all of the other 78 participating countries in all categories (math, reading, and science) in the Program for International Student Assessment, a worldwide study of academic performance conducted by the OECD.[179]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Beijing Ancient Observatory\nPeople native to urban Beijing speak the Beijing dialect, which belongs to the Mandarin subdivision of spoken Chinese. This speech is the basis for *putonghua*, the standard spoken language used in mainland China and Taiwan, and one of the four official languages of Singapore. Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have their own dialects akin to those of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.\n\n\nBeijing or Peking opera is a traditional form of Chinese theater well known throughout the nation. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of Chinese culture, Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song, spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences involving gestures, movement, fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic stage dialect quite different from Modern Standard Chinese and from the modern Beijing dialect.[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sliced Peking duck served with traditional condiments\nBeijing cuisine is the local style of cooking. Peking duck is perhaps the best known dish. Fuling jiabing, a traditional Beijing snack food, is a pancake (*bing*) resembling a flat disk with a filling made from *fu ling*, a fungus used in traditional Chinese medicine. Teahouses are also common in Beijing.\n\n\nThe cloisonné (or *Jingtailan*, literally \"Blue of Jingtai\") metalworking technique and tradition is a Beijing art speciality, and is one of the most revered traditional crafts in China. Cloisonné making requires elaborate and complicated processes which include base-hammering, copper-strip inlay, soldering, enamel-filling, enamel-firing, surface polishing and gilding.[181] Beijing's lacquerware is also well known for its sophisticated and intricate patterns and images carved into its surface, and the various decoration techniques of lacquer include \"carved lacquer\" and \"engraved gold\".\n\n\nYounger residents of Beijing have become more attracted to the nightlife, which has flourished in recent decades, breaking prior cultural traditions that had practically restricted it to the upper class.[182] Today, Houhai, Sanlitun and Wudaokou are Beijing's nightlife hotspots.\n\n\nIn 2012 Beijing was named as City of Design and became part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.[183]\n\n\n\n### Places of interest[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Major National Historical and Cultural Sites (Beijing) and List of Beijing landmarks\n\n\n> ...the city remains an epicenter of tradition with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on view—in the famed Forbidden City and in the city's lush pavilions and gardens...\n> \n> — National Geographic[184]\n> \n\n\n![](image)Qianmen Avenue, a traditional commercial street outside Qianmen Gate along the southern Central Axis\n![](image)Inside the Forbidden City\nAt the historical heart of Beijing lies the Forbidden City, the enormous palace compound that was the home of the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties;[185] the Forbidden City hosts the Palace Museum, which contains imperial collections of Chinese art. Surrounding the Forbidden City are several former imperial gardens, parks and scenic areas, notably Beihai, Shichahai, Zhongnanhai, Jingshan and Zhongshan. These places, particularly Beihai Park, are described as masterpieces of Chinese gardening art,[186] and are tourist destinations of historical importance;[187] in the modern era, Zhongnanhai has also been the political heart of various Chinese governments and regimes and is now the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council. From Tiananmen Square, right across from the Forbidden City, there are several notable sites, such as the Tiananmen, Qianmen, the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, the Monument to the People's Heroes, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The Summer Palace and the Old Summer Palace both lie at the western part of the city; the former, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[188] contains a comprehensive collection of imperial gardens and palaces that served as the summer retreats for the Qing imperial family.\n\n\nAmong the best known religious sites in the city is the Temple of Heaven (*Tiantan*), located in southeastern Beijing, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[189] where emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties made visits for annual ceremonies of prayers to Heaven for good harvest. In the north of the city is the Temple of Earth (*Ditan*), while the Temple of the Sun (*Ritan*) and the Temple of the Moon (*Yuetan*) lie in the eastern and western urban areas respectively.

The Beijing Zoo is a center of zoological research that also contains rare animals from various continents, including the Chinese giant panda.\n\n\nThere are 144 museums and galleries (as of June 2008[update]) in the city.[190][191][192] In addition to the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City and the National Museum of China, other major museums include the National Art Museum of China, the Capital Museum, the Beijing Art Museum, the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Geological Museum of China, the Beijing Museum of Natural History and the Paleozoological Museum of China.[192]\n\n\nLocated at the outskirts of urban Beijing, but within its municipality are the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming dynasty, the lavish and elaborate burial sites of thirteen Ming emperors, which have been designated as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.[193] The archaeological Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian is another World Heritage Site within the municipality,[194] containing a wealth of discoveries, among them one of the first specimens of *Homo erectus* and an assemblage of bones of the gigantic hyena *Pachycrocuta brevirostris*. There are several sections of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Great Wall of China,[195] most notably Badaling, Jinshanling, Simatai and Mutianyu. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Beijing is the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[196] Theme parks located within the city include Universal Studios Beijing and Happy Valley Beijing, both of which are among the most visited theme parks in Asia.[197]\n\n\n\n### Intangible cultural heritage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Peking opera\nThe cultural heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse. Starting 2006, the Beijing government started the process of selecting and preserving cultural heritages. Five cultural heritage lists have been published over the years. 288 distinct practices are categorized as cultural heritage. These 288 cultural heritages are further divided into ten categories, namely folk music, folk dance, traditional opera, melodious art, juggling and game, folk art, traditional handicraft, traditional medicine, folk literature and folklore.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n* Folk music\n\t+ Zhihua Temple music\n\t+ Tongzhou shanty\n* Folk dance\n\t+ Tongzhou Dragon dance\n\t+ Miliangtun Stilts\n* Traditional opera\n\t+ Kunqu\n\t+ Peking opera\n* Melodious art\n\t+ Xiangsheng\n* Acrobatic Performance and game\n\t+ Weiqi(Go)\n\t+ Xiangqi\n* Folk art\n\t+ Ivory carving\n* Traditional handicraft\n\t+ Peking duck manufacturing techniques\n\t+ Cloisonné manufacturing techniques\n* Traditional medicine\n\t+ Tong Ren Tang culture\n* Folk literature\n\t+ Yongding River legend[*permanent dead link*]\n* Folklore\n\t+ Miaohui\n\t+ Lantern Festival\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThe religious heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse as Chinese folk religion, Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam and Christianity all have significant historical presence in the city. As the national capital, the city also hosts the State Administration for Religious Affairs and various state-sponsored institutions of the leading religions.[202] In recent decades, foreign residents have brought other religions to the city.[202] According to Wang Zhiyun of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2010 there were 2.2 million Buddhists in the city, equal to 11.2% of the total population.[203] According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 0.78% of the city's population.[204] According to a 2010 survey, Muslims constitute 1.76% of the population of Beijing.[205]\n\n\n\n### Chinese folk religion and Taoism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fire God Temple in Di'anmen\nBeijing has many temples dedicated to folk religious and communal deities, many of which are being reconstructed or refurbished in the 2000s and 2010s. Yearly sacrifices to the God of Heaven (祭天; *jìtiān*) at the Temple of Heaven have been resumed by Confucian groups in the 2010s.\n\n\nThere are temples dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (娘娘; *Niángniáng*) in the city, one of them near the Olympic Village, and they revolve around a major cult center at Mount Miaofeng.

Many of these temples are governed by the Beijing Taoist Association, such as the Fire God Temple of the Shicha Lake, while many others are not and are governed by popular committees and locals. A great Temple of Xuanyuan Huangdi will be built in Pinggu (possibly as an expansion of the already existing shrine) within 2020, and the temple will feature a statue of the deity which will be amongst the tallest in the world.[206][207]\n\n\nThe national Chinese Taoist Association and Chinese Taoist College have their headquarters at the White Cloud Temple of Quanzhen Taoism, which was founded in 741 and rebuilt numerous times.

The Big Air Shougang ski jump is in the western suburbs and was built for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[219]\n\n\n\n### Clubs[edit]\n\n\nProfessional sports teams based in Beijing include:\n\n\n\n* China Baseball League\n\t+ Beijing Tigers\n* Chinese Basketball Association\n\t+ Beijing Ducks\n\t+ Beijing Royal Fighters\n* Women's Chinese Basketball Association\n\t+ Beijing Shougang\n* Kontinental Hockey League\n\t+ HC Kunlun Red Star\n* Chinese Super League\n\t+ Beijing Guoan\n* China League Two\n\t+ Beijing BIT\n* Chinese Women's National League\n\t+ Beijing BG Phoenix\n\nThe Beijing Olympians of the American Basketball Association, formerly a Chinese Basketball Association team, kept their name and maintained a roster of primarily Chinese players after moving to Maywood, California in 2005.\n\n\nChina Bandy Federation is based in Beijing, one of several cities in which the potential for bandy development is explored.[220]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Beijing\n\n![](image)Beijing South railway station, one of several rail stations in the city\nBeijing is an important transport hub in North China with six ring roads, 1167 km (725 miles) of expressways,[221] 15 National Highways, nine conventional railways, and six high-speed railways converging on the city.\n\n\n\n### Rail and high-speed rail[edit]\n\n\nBeijing serves as a large rail hub in China's railway network. Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: Shanghai (Jinghu Line), Guangzhou (Jingguang Line), Kowloon (Jingjiu Line), Harbin (Jingha Line) (including Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)), Baotou (Jingbao Line), Chengde (Jingcheng Line), Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line), Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line) and Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line). In addition, the Datong–Qinhuangdao railway passes through the municipality to the north of the city.\n\n\nBeijing also has six high-speed rail lines: the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway, which opened in 2008; the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, which opened in 2011; the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway, which opened in 2012; and the Beijing–Xiong'an intercity railway and the Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway, both of which opened in 2019. The Beijing–Shenyang high-speed railway was completed in 2021.\n\n\nThe city's main railway stations are the Beijing railway station, which opened in 1959; the Beijing West railway station, which opened in 1996; and the Beijing South railway station, which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008; The Beijing North railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2009; The Qinghe railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2019; The Beijing Chaoyang railway station opened in 2021; The Beijing Fengtai railway station opened in 2022; and the Beijing Sub-Center railway station is under construction.\n\n\nSmaller stations in the city including Beijing East railway station and Daxing Airport station handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.[222]\n\n\nFrom Beijing, direct passenger train service is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam and North Korea. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their direction in relation to Beijing.\n\n\n\n### Roads and expressways[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Expressways of Beijing and China National Highways of Beijing\n\n![](image)View of 4th Ring Road in Chaoyang District\n![](image)Traffic jam on the Beijing–Tongzhou Expressway\nBeijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Many expressways of China serve Beijing, as do 15 China National Highways. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the \"ring roads\" that concentrically surround the city, with the Forbidden City area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official \"1st Ring Road\". The 2nd Ring Road is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend outwards, with the 5th and 6th Ring Roads being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd Ring Road outward. A final outer orbital, the Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95), was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring Tianjin and Hebei.\n\n\nWithin the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with \"inner\" and \"outer\" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.\n\n\n\n![](image)Beijing–Lhasa Expressway in Changping District\nBeijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.[223] The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour. In the beginning of 2010, Beijing had 4 million registered automobiles.[224] By the end of 2010, the government forecast 5 million. In 2010, new car registrations in Beijing averaged 15,500 per week.[225]\n\n\nTowards the end of 2010, the city government announced a series of drastic measures to tackle traffic jams, including limiting the number of new license plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month and barring cars with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hour.[226] More restrictive measures are also reserved during major events or heavily polluted weather.\n\n\nRoad signs began to be standardized with both Chinese and English names displayed, with location names using pinyin, in 2008.[227]\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n#### Beijing Capital International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Terminal 3 of the Beijing Capital International Airport\nBeijing has two of the world's largest airports. The Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK) located 32 kilometres (20 mi) northeast of the city center in Chaoyang District bordering Shunyi District, is the second busiest airport in the world after Atlanta's Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport.[14] Capital Airport's Terminal 3, built during the expansion for the 2008 Olympics, is one of the largest in the world. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China and Hainan Airlines. The Airport Expressway and Second Airport Expressway, connect to Capital Airport from the northeast and east of the city center, respectively. Driving time from city center is about 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. The Capital Airport Express line of Beijing Subway and the Capital Airport Bus serves the Capital Airport.\n\n\n\n#### Beijing Daxing International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing Daxing International Airport\nThe Beijing Daxing International Airport (IATA: PKX) located 46 kilometres (29 mi) south of the city in Daxing District bordering the city of Langfang, Hebei Province, opened on 25 September 2019.[228][229][230] The Daxing Airport has one of the world's largest terminal buildings and is expected to be a major airport serving Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei Province. Daxing Airport is connected to the city via the Beijing–Xiong'an intercity railway, the Daxing Airport Express line of the Beijing Subway and two expressways.\n\n\n\n#### Other airports[edit]\n\n\nWith the opening of the Daxing Airport in September 2019, the Beijing Nanyuan Airport (IATA: NAY), located 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) south of center in Fengtai District, has been closed to civilian airline service. Other airports in the city at Liangxiang, Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling are primarily for military use.\n\n\n\n#### Visa requirements for air passengers[edit]\n\n\nAs of 1 January 2013[update], tourists from 45 countries are permitted a 72-hour visa-free stay in Beijing. The 45 countries include Singapore, Japan, the United States, Canada, all EU and EEA countries (except Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The programme benefits transit and business travellers[231] with the 72 hours calculated starting from the moment visitors receive their transit stay permits rather than the time of their plane's arrival. Foreign visitors are not permitted to leave Beijing for other Chinese cities during the 72 hours.[232]\n\n\n\n### Public transit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Daxing line train on the Beijing Subway, which is among the longest and busiest rapid transit systems in the world\n![](image)An articulated Beijing bus\nThe Beijing Subway, which began operating in 1969, now has 25 lines, 459 stations, and 783 km (487 mi) of lines. It is the longest subway system in the world and first in annual ridership with 3.66 billion rides delivered in 2016. In 2013, with a flat fare of ¥2.00 (US$0.31) per ride with unlimited transfers on all lines except the Airport Express, the subway was also the most affordable rapid transit system in China. The subway is undergoing rapid expansion and is expected to reach 30 lines, 450 stations, 1,050 kilometres (650 mi) in length by 2022. When fully implemented, 95% of residents inside the Fourth Ring Road will be able to walk to a station in 15 minutes.[233][*better source needed*] The Beijing Suburban Railway provides commuter rail service to outlying suburbs of the municipality.\n\n\nOn 28 December 2014, the Beijing Subway switched to a distance-based fare system from a fixed fare for all lines except the Airport Express.[234] Under the new system a trip under 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) will cost ¥3.00(US$0.49), an additional ¥1.00 will be added for the next 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) and the next 10 km (6 mi) until the distance for the trip reaches 32 km (20 mi).[234] For every 20 kilometres (12 miles) after the original 32 kilometres (20 miles) an additional ¥1.00 is added.[234] For example, a 50-kilometre (31-mile) trip would cost ¥ 8.00.\n\n\nThere are nearly 1,000 public bus and trolleybus lines in the city, including four bus rapid transit lines. Standard bus fares are as low as ¥1.00 when purchased with the *Yikatong* metrocard.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nMetered taxi in Beijing start at ¥13 for the first 3 kilometres (1.9 mi), ¥2.3 Renminbi per additional 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) and ¥1 per ride fuel surcharge, not counting idling fees which are ¥2.3 (¥4.6 during rush hours of 7–9 am and 5–7 pm) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than 12 kilometres per hour (7.5 mph). Most taxis are Hyundai Elantras, Hyundai Sonatas, Peugeots, Citroëns and Volkswagen Jettas. After 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), the base fare increases by 50% (but is only applied to the portion *over* that distance). Different companies have special colours combinations painted on their vehicles. Usually registered taxis have yellowish brown as basic hue, with another color of Prussian blue, hunter green, white, umber, tyrian purple, rufous, or sea green. Between 11 pm and 5 am, there is also a 20% fee increase. Rides over 15 km (9 mi) and between 23:00 and 06:00 incur both charges, for a total increase of 80%. Tolls during trip should be covered by customers and the costs of trips beyond Beijing city limits should be negotiated with the driver. The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver.\n\n\n\n### Bicycles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Huilongguan-Shangdi Bicycle Lane\nBeijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Many cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated bicycle lanes. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient. The rise of electric bicycles and electric scooters, which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes, may have brought about a revival in bicycle-speed two-wheeled transport. It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city. Because of the growing traffic congestion, the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling, but it is not clear whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale.[235] On 30 March 2019, a 6.5 km (4 mile) bicycle-dedicated lane was opened, easing the traffic congestion between Huilongguan and Shangdi where there are many high-tech companies.[236] Cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity spurred by the emergence of a large number of dockless app based bikeshares such as Mobike, Bluegogo and Ofo since 2016.[237]\n\n\n\n## Defence and aerospace[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KJ-2000 and J-10s started the flypast formation on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.\nThe command headquarters of China's military forces are based in Beijing. The Central Military Commission, the political organ in charge of the military, is housed inside the Ministry of National Defense, located next to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in western Beijing. The Rocket Force, which controls the country's strategic missile and nuclear weapons, has its command in Qinghe, Haidian District. The headquarters of the Central Theater Command, one of five nationally, is based further west in Gaojing. The CTR oversees the Beijing Capital Garrison as well as the 81st, 82nd and 83rd Armies, which are based in Hebei.\n\n\nMilitary institutions in Beijing also include academies and thinktanks such as the PLA National Defence University and Academy of Military Science, military hospitals such as the 301, 307 and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and army-affiliated cultural entities such as 1 August Film Studios and the PLA Song and Dance Troupe.\n\n\nThe China National Space Administration, which oversees country's space program, and several space-related state owned companies such as CASTC and CASIC are all based in Beijing. The Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center, in Haidian District tracks the country's crewed and uncrewed flight and other space exploration initiatives.\n\n\n\n## Nature and wildlife[edit]\n\n\nBeijing Municipality has 20 nature reserves that have a total area of 1,339.7 km2 (517.3 sq mi).[238] The mountains to the west and north of the city are home to a number of protected wildlife species including leopard, leopard cat, wolf, red fox, wild boar, masked palm civet, raccoon dog, hog badger, Siberian weasel, Amur hedgehog, roe deer, and mandarin rat snake.[239][240][241] The Beijing Aquatic Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center protects the Chinese giant salamander, Amur stickleback and mandarin duck on the Huaijiu and Huaisha Rivers in Huairou District.[242] The Beijing Milu Park south of the city is home to one of the largest herds of Père David's deer, now extinct in the wild. The Beijing barbastelle, a species of vesper bat discovered in caves of Fangshan District in 2001 and identified as a distinct species in 2007, is endemic to Beijing. The mountains of Fangshan are also habitat for the more common Beijing mouse-eared bat, large myotis, greater horseshoe bat and Rickett's big-footed bat.[243]\n\n\nEach year, Beijing hosts 200–300 species of migratory birds including the common crane, black-headed gull, swan, mallard, common cuckoo and the endangered yellow-breasted bunting.[244][245] In May 2016, Common cuckoos nesting in the wetlands of Cuihu (Haidian), Hanshiqiao (Shunyi), Yeyahu (Yanqing) were tagged and have been traced to far as India, Kenya and Mozambique.[246][247] In the fall of 2016, the Beijing Forest Police undertook a month-long campaign to crack down on illegal hunting and trapping of migratory birds for sale in local bird markets.[245] Over 1,000 rescued birds of protected species including streptopelia, Eurasian siskin, crested myna, coal tit and great tit were handed to the Beijing Wildlife Protection and Rescue Center for repatriation to the wild.[245][248]\n\n\nThe city flowers are the Chinese rose and chrysanthemum.[249] The city trees are the Chinese arborvitae, an evergreen in the cypress family and the pagoda tree, also called the Chinese scholar tree, a deciduous tree of the family Fabaceae.[249] The oldest scholar tree in the city was planted in what is now Beihai Park during the Tang dynasty.[250]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nThe capital is the home of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral development bank that aims to improve economic and social outcomes in Asia[251] and the Silk Road Fund, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.[252] Beijing is also home to the headquarters of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),[253] making it an important city for international diplomacy.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in China\n\nBeijing is twinned with the following regions, cities, and counties:[254]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n* ![](image) Ankara, Turkey\n* ![](image) Astana, Kazakhstan\n* ![](image) Athens, Greece\n* ![](image) Bangkok, Thailand\n* ![](image) Berlin, Germany\n* ![](image) Brussels, Belgium\n* ![](image) Bucharest, Romania\n* ![](image) Budapest, Hungary\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina\n* ![](image) Cairo, Egypt\n* ![](image) Canberra, Australia\n* ![](image) Cologne, Germany\n* ![](image) Copenhagen, Denmark\n* ![](image) Delhi, India\n* ![](image) Doha, Qatar\n* ![](image) Dublin, Ireland\n* ![](image) Hanoi, Vietnam\n* ![](image) Havana, Cuba\n* ![](image) Île-de-France, France\n* ![](image) Islamabad, Pakistan\n* ![](image) Jakarta, Indonesia\n* ![](image) Johannesburg, South Africa\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine\n* ![](image) Lima, Peru\n* ![](image) London, England, United Kingdom\n* ![](image) Manila, Philippines\n* ![](image) Minsk, Belarus\n* ![](image) Mexico City, Mexico\n* ![](image) Moscow, Russia\n* ![](image) New York City, United States\n* ![](image) Ottawa, Canada\n* ![](image) Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n* ![](image) Riga, Latvia\n* ![](image) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n* ![](image) San José, Costa Rica\n* ![](image) Santiago, Chile\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![Estonia](image) Tallinn, Estonia\n* ![](image) Tehran, Iran\n* ![](image) Tel Aviv, Israel\n* ![](image) Tirana, Albania\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan\n* ![](image) Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\n* ![](image) Vientiane, Laos\n* ![](image) Washington D.C., United States\n* ![](image) Wellington, New Zealand\n\n### Foreign embassies and consulates[edit]\n\n\nSee also: list of diplomatic missions in China\nIn 2019, China had the largest diplomatic network in the world.[255] China hosts a large diplomatic community in its capital city of Beijing.

With its urban area's population numbering over three million, it is also the eighth largest urban area in the European Union. Athens dominates and is the capital of the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years,[6] and its earliest human presence beginning somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. The city was named after Athena, the ancient Greek goddess of wisdom.[7]\n\n\nClassical Athens was one of the most powerful city-states in ancient Greece. It was a centre for democracy, the arts, education and philosophy,[8][9] and was highly influential throughout the European continent, particularly in Ancient Rome.[10] For this reason, it is often regarded as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy in its own right independently from the rest of Greece.[11][12] In modern times, Athens is a huge cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2023, Athens metropolitan area and its surrounding municipalities (consisting the regional area of Attica) has a population of approximately 3.8 million.[13][14]\n\n\nAthens is a Beta-status global city according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network,[15] and is one of the biggest economic centers in Southeastern Europe. It also has a large financial sector, and its port Piraeus is both the 2nd busiest passenger port in Europe,[16] and the 13th largest container port in the world.[17] The Municipality of Athens (also City of Athens), which constitutes a small administrative unit of the entire urban area, had a population of 698.567 (in 2023)[3] within its official limits, and a land area of 38.96 km2 (15.04 sq mi).[18][19] The Athens metropolitan area or Greater Athens[20] extends beyond its administrative municipal city limits as well as its urban agglomeration, with a population of 4,207,281 (in 2023)[3] over an area of 2,928.717 km2 (1,131 sq mi).[19] Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland.\n\n\nThe heritage of the Classical Era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments, and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western culture. The city also retains Roman, Byzantine and a smaller number of Ottoman monuments, while its historical urban core features elements of continuity through its millennia of history. Athens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery. Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the Hellenic Parliament and the Architectural Trilogy of Athens, consisting of the National Library of Greece, the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and the Academy of Athens. Athens is also home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the National Archeological Museum, featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the Acropolis Museum, the Museum of Cycladic Art, the Benaki Museum, and the Byzantine and Christian Museum. Athens was the host city of the first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896, and 108 years later it hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics, making it one of five cities to have hosted the Summer Olympics on multiple occasions.[21] Athens joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and names[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of European cities in different languages (A)\n\nIn Ancient Greek, the name of the city was Ἀθῆναι (*Athênai*, pronounced [atʰɛ̂ːnai̯] in Classical Attic) a plural. In earlier Greek, such as Homeric Greek, the name had been current in the singular form though, as Ἀθήνη (*Athḗnē*).[22] It was possibly rendered in the plural later on, like those of Θῆβαι (*Thêbai*) and Μυκῆναι (*Μukênai*). The root of the word is probably not of Greek or Indo-European origin,[23] and is possibly a remnant of the Pre-Greek substrate of Attica.[23] In antiquity, it was debated whether Athens took its name from its patron goddess Athena (Attic Ἀθηνᾶ, *Athēnâ*, Ionic Ἀθήνη, *Athḗnē*, and Doric Ἀθάνα, *Athā́nā*) or Athena took her name from the city.[24] Modern scholars now generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city,[24] because the ending -*ene* is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names.[24]\n\n\nAccording to the ancient Athenian founding myth, Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, competed against Poseidon, the God of the Seas, for patronage of the yet-unnamed city;[25] they agreed that whoever gave the Athenians the better gift would become their patron[25] and appointed Cecrops, the king of Athens, as the judge.[25] According to the account given by Pseudo-Apollodorus, Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and a salt water spring welled up.[25] In an alternative version of the myth from Vergil's poem *Georgics*, Poseidon instead gave the Athenians the first horse.[25] In both versions, Athena offered the Athenians the first domesticated olive tree.[25][26] Cecrops accepted this gift[25] and declared Athena the patron goddess of Athens.[25][26] Eight different etymologies, now commonly rejected, have been proposed since the 17th century. Christian Lobeck proposed as the root of the name the word ἄθος (*áthos*) or ἄνθος (*ánthos*) meaning \"flower\", to denote Athens as the \"flowering city\". Ludwig von Döderlein proposed the stem of the verb θάω, stem θη- (*tháō*, *thē-*, \"to suck\") to denote Athens as having fertile soil.[27] Athenians were called cicada-wearers (Ancient Greek: Τεττιγοφόροι) because they used to wear pins of golden cicadas. A symbol of being autochthonous (earth-born), because the legendary founder of Athens, Erechtheus was an autochthon or of being musicians, because the cicada is a \"musician\" insect.[28] In classical literature, the city was sometimes referred to as the City of the Violet Crown, first documented in Pindar's ἰοστέφανοι Ἀθᾶναι (*iostéphanoi Athânai*), or as τὸ κλεινὸν ἄστυ (*tò kleinòn ásty*, \"the glorious city\").\n\n\nDuring the medieval period, the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular as Ἀθήνα. Variant names included Setines, Satine, and Astines, all derivations involving false splitting of prepositional phrases.[29] King Alphonse X of Castile gives the pseudo-etymology 'the one without death/ignorance'.[30][*page needed*] In Ottoman Turkish, it was called آتينا *Ātīnā*,[31] and in modern Turkish, it is *Atina*.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Athens\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Athens.\n\nHistorical affiliations\n\n\n> \n> Kingdom of Athens 1556 BC–1068 BC  \n> \n> City-state of Athens 1068 BC–322 BC  \n> \n> Hellenic League 338 BC–322 BC  \n> \n> Kingdom of Macedonia 322 BC–148 BC  \n> \n> Roman Republic 146 BC–27 BC  \n> \n> Roman Empire 27 BC–395 AD  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 395–1205  \n> \n> ![](image) Duchy of Athens 1205–1458  \n> \n> ![](image) Ottoman Empire 1458–1822, 1827–1832  \n> \n> ![](image) Greece 1822–1827, 1832–present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Classical Athens, Hellenistic Greece, and Roman Greece\n\nThe oldest known human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist, which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th millennia BC.[7] Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 5,000 years (3000 BC).[32][33] By 1400 BC, the settlement had become an important centre of the Mycenaean civilization, and the Acropolis was the site of a major Mycenaean fortress, whose remains can be recognised from sections of the characteristic Cyclopean walls.[34] Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as Mycenae and Pylos, it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200 BC, an event often attributed to a Dorian invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were pure Ionians with no Dorian element. However, Athens, like many other Bronze Age settlements, went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.[35] Iron Age burials, in the Kerameikos[36] and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900 BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.[37]\n\n\nBy the sixth century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of Solon. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by Cleisthenes in 508 BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the rebellion of the Ionian cities against Persian rule. In the ensuing Greco-Persian Wars Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at Marathon in 490 BC, and crucially at Salamis in 480 BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being captured and sacked twice by the Persians within one year, after a heroic but ultimately failed resistance at Thermopylae by Spartans and other Greeks led by King Leonidas,[38] after both Boeotia and Attica fell to the Persians.\n\n\n\n![](image)Delian League under the leadership of Athens before the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC\nThe decades that followed became known as the Golden Age of Athenian democracy, during which time Athens became the leading city of Ancient Greece, with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for Western civilization.[11][12] The playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates, and the philosopher Socrates. Guided by Pericles, who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the Parthenon), as well as empire-building via the Delian League. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival Sparta.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Acropolis hill in Athens\nBy the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of Macedon was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338 BC the armies of Philip II defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a free city because of its widely admired schools. In the second century AD, The Roman emperor Hadrian, himself an Athenian citizen,[40] ordered the construction of a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the Temple of Olympian Zeus.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tower of the Winds in the Roman Agora, the second commercial centre of ancient Athens\nIn the early 4th century AD, the Eastern Roman Empire began to be governed from Constantinople, and with the construction and expansion of the imperial city, many of Athens's works of art were taken by the emperors to adorn it. The Empire became Christianized, and the use of Latin declined in favour of exclusive use of Greek; in the Roman imperial period, both languages had been used. In the later Roman period, Athens was ruled by the emperors continuing until the 13th century, its citizens identifying themselves as citizens of the Roman Empire (\"*Rhomaioi*\"). The conversion of the empire from paganism to Christianity greatly affected Athens, resulting in reduced reverence for the city.[33] Ancient monuments such as the Parthenon, Erechtheion and the Hephaisteion (Theseion) were converted into churches. As the empire became increasingly anti-pagan, Athens became a provincial town and experienced fluctuating fortunes.\n\n\nThe city remained an important center of learning, especially of Neoplatonism—with notable pupils including Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil of Caesarea and emperor Julian (r. 355–363)—and consequently a center of paganism. Christian items do not appear in the archaeological record until the early 5th century.[41] The sack of the city by the Herules in 267 and by the Visigoths under their king Alaric I (r. 395–410) in 396, however, dealt a heavy blow to the city's fabric and fortunes, and Athens was henceforth confined to a small fortified area that embraced a fraction of the ancient city.[41] The emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) banned the teaching of philosophy by pagans in 529,[42] an event whose impact on the city is much debated,[41] but is generally taken to mark the end of the ancient history of Athens. Athens was sacked by the Slavs in 582, but remained in imperial hands thereafter, as highlighted by the visit of the emperor Constans II (r. 641–668) in 662/3 and its inclusion in the Theme of Hellas.[41]\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Byzantine Greece and Duchy of Athens\n\n![](image)The Byzantine Church of the Holy Apostles next to the Stoa of Attalos\nThe city was threatened by Saracen raids in the 8th–9th centuries—in 896, Athens was raided and possibly occupied for a short period, an event which left some archaeological remains and elements of Arabic ornamentation in contemporary buildings[43]—but there is also evidence of a mosque existing in the city at the time.[41] In the great dispute over Byzantine Iconoclasm, Athens is commonly held to have supported the iconophile position, chiefly due to the role played by Empress Irene of Athens in the ending of the first period of Iconoclasm at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.[41] A few years later, another Athenian, Theophano, became empress as the wife of Staurakios (r. 811–812).[41]\n\n\nInvasion of the empire by the Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, and the ensuing civil wars, largely passed the region by and Athens continued its provincial existence unharmed. When the Byzantine Empire was rescued by the resolute leadership of the three Komnenos emperors Alexios, John and Manuel, Attica and the rest of Greece prospered. Archaeological evidence tells us that the medieval town experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the 11th century and continuing until the end of the 12th century.\n\n\n\n![](image)Frankish Tower of the Acropolis of Athens\nThe Agora (marketplace) had been deserted since late antiquity, began to be built over, and soon the town became an important centre for the production of soaps and dyes. The growth of the town attracted the Venetians, and various other traders who frequented the ports of the Aegean, to Athens. This interest in trade appears to have further increased the economic prosperity of the town.\n\n\nThe 11th and 12th centuries were the Golden Age of Byzantine art in Athens. Almost all of the most important Middle Byzantine churches in and around Athens were built during these two centuries, and this reflects the growth of the town in general. However, this medieval prosperity was not to last. In 1204, the Fourth Crusade conquered Athens and the city was not recovered from the Latins before it was taken by the Ottoman Turks. It did not become Greek in government again until the 19th century.\n\n\nFrom 1204 until 1458, Athens was ruled by Latins in three separate periods, following the Crusades. The \"Latins\", or \"Franks\", were western Europeans and followers of the Latin Church brought to the Eastern Mediterranean during the Crusades. Along with rest of Byzantine Greece, Athens was part of the series of feudal fiefs, similar to the Crusader states established in Syria and on Cyprus after the First Crusade. This period is known as the *Frankokratia*.\n\n\n\n### Ottoman Athens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ottoman Greece\n\n![](image)Tzistarakis Mosque, an Ottoman mosque, built in 1759, in Monastiraki Square\nThe first Ottoman attack on Athens, which involved a short-lived occupation of the town, came in 1397, under the Ottoman generals Yaqub Pasha and Timurtash.[43] Finally, in 1458, Athens was captured by the Ottomans under the personal leadership of Sultan Mehmed II.[43] As the Ottoman Sultan rode into the city, he was greatly struck by the beauty of its ancient monuments and issued a *firman* (imperial edict) forbidding their looting or destruction, on pain of death. The Parthenon was converted into the main mosque of the city.[33]\n\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, Athens was denuded of any importance and its population severely declined, leaving it as a \"small country town\" (Franz Babinger).[43] From the early 17th century, Athens came under the jurisdiction of the Kizlar Agha, the chief black eunuch of the Sultan's harem. The city had originally been granted by Sultan Ahmed I (r. 1603–1617) to Basilica, one of his favourite concubines, who hailed from the city, in response of complaints of maladministration by the local governors. After her death, Athens came under the purview of the Kizlar Agha.[44]\n\n\nThe Turks began a practice of storing gunpowder and explosives in the Parthenon and Propylaea. In 1640, a lightning bolt struck the Propylaea, causing its destruction.[45] In 1687, during the Morean War, the Acropolis was besieged by the Venetians under Francesco Morosini, and the temple of Athena Nike was dismantled by the Ottomans to fortify the Parthenon. A shot fired during the bombardment of the Acropolis caused a powder magazine in the Parthenon to explode (26 September), and the building was severely damaged, giving it largely the appearance it has today. The Venetian occupation of Athens lasted for six months, and both the Venetians and the Ottomans participated in the looting of the Parthenon. One of its western pediments was removed, causing even more damage to the structure.[33][43] During the Venetian occupation, the two mosques of the city were converted into Catholic and Protestant churches, but on 9 April 1688 the Venetians abandoned Athens again to the Ottomans.[43]\n\n\n\n### Modern history[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Greek War of Independence, Kingdom of Greece, and Republic of Greece\n\n![](image)*The Entry of King Otto in Athens*, Peter von Hess, 1839\nIn 1822, a Greek insurgency captured the city, but it fell to the Ottomans again in 1826 (though Acropolis held till June 1827). Again the ancient monuments suffered badly. The Ottoman forces remained in possession until March 1833, when they withdrew. At that time, the city (as throughout the Ottoman period) had a small population of an estimated 400 houses, mostly located around the Acropolis in the Plaka.\n\n\nFollowing the Greek War of Independence and the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, Athens was chosen to replace Nafplio as the second capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons.[46] At the time, after the extensive destruction it had suffered during the war of independence, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people (less than half its earlier population) in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first King of Greece, Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Olympic Flame at the opening ceremony of the 2004 Summer Olympics\nThe first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the Acropolis, the ancient cemetery of Kerameikos and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the Greek Parliament), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital.[*citation needed*] In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern Olympic Games. During the 1920s a number of Greek refugees, expelled from Asia Minor after the Greco-Turkish War and Greek genocide, swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following World War II, and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded,[*citation needed*] and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge.[*citation needed*] A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the Attiki Odos motorway, the expansion of the Athens Metro, and the new Athens International Airport), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004, Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Athens Urban Area within the Attica Basin from space\nAthens sprawls across the central plain of Attica that is often referred to as the **Athens Basin** or the **Attica Basin** (Greek: Λεκανοπέδιο Αθηνών/Αττικής). The basin is bounded by four large mountains: Mount Aigaleo to the west, Mount Parnitha to the north, Mount Pentelicus to the northeast and Mount Hymettus to the east.[47] Beyond Mount Aegaleo lies the Thriasian plain, which forms an extension of the central plain to the west. The Saronic Gulf lies to the southwest. Mount Parnitha is the tallest of the four mountains (1,413 m (4,636 ft)),[48] and has been declared a national park. The Athens urban area spreads over 50 kilometres (31 mi) from Agios Stefanos in the north to Varkiza in the south. The city is located in the north temperate zone, 38 degrees north of the equator.\n\n\nAthens is built around a number of hills. Lycabettus is one of the tallest hills of the city proper and provides a view of the entire Attica Basin. The meteorology of Athens is deemed to be one of the most complex in the world because its mountains cause a temperature inversion phenomenon which, along with the Greek government's difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air pollution problems the city has faced.[33] This issue is not unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and Mexico City also suffer from similar atmospheric inversion problems.[33]\n\n\nThe Cephissus river, the Ilisos and the Eridanos stream are the historical rivers of Athens.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smog in Athens\nBy the late 1970s, the pollution of Athens had become so destructive that according to the then Greek Minister of Culture, Constantine Trypanis, \"...the carved details on the five the caryatids of the Erechtheum had seriously degenerated, while the face of the horseman on the Parthenon's west side was all but obliterated.\"[49] A series of measures taken by the authorities of the city throughout the 1990s resulted in the improvement of air quality; the appearance of smog (or *nefos* as the Athenians used to call it) has become less common.\n\n\nMeasures taken by the Greek authorities throughout the 1990s have improved the quality of air over the Attica Basin. Nevertheless, air pollution still remains an issue for Athens, particularly during the hottest summer days. In late June 2007,[50] the Attica region experienced a number of brush fires,[50] including a blaze that burned a significant portion of a large forested national park in Mount Parnitha,[51] considered critical to maintaining a better air quality in Athens all year round.[50] Damage to the park has led to worries over a stalling in the improvement of air quality in the city.[50]\n\n\nThe major waste management efforts undertaken in the last decade (particularly the plant built on the small island of Psytalia) have greatly improved water quality in the Saronic Gulf, and the coastal waters of Athens are now accessible again to swimmers.\n\n\n\n#### Parks and zoos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Pedion tou Areos park\n![](image)The entrance of the National Gardens, commissioned by Queen Amalia in 1838 and completed by 1840\nParnitha National Park is punctuated by well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves dotting the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains are popular outdoor activities for residents of the city. The National Garden of Athens was completed in 1840 and is a green refuge of 15.5 hectares in the centre of the Greek capital. It is to be found between the Parliament and Zappeion buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares. Parts of the City Centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the *Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens*, which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project.[52][53] The landmark Dionysiou Areopagitou Street has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the Temple of Olympian Zeus at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near Plaka, and finishes just beyond the Temple of Hephaestus in Thiseio. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the Parthenon and the Agora (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy City Centre.\n\n\nThe hills of Athens also provide green space. Lycabettus, Philopappos hill and the area around it, including Pnyx and Ardettos hill, are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland. Also to be found is the Pedion tou Areos (*Field of Mars*) of 27.7 hectares, near the National Archaeological Museum. Athens' largest zoo is the Attica Zoological Park, a 20-hectare (49-acre) private zoo located in the suburb of Spata. The zoo is home to around 2000 animals representing 400 species, and is open 365 days a year. Smaller zoos exist within public gardens or parks, such as the zoo within the National Garden of Athens.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sunrise in Athens\nAthens has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: *Csa*). According to the meteorological station near the city center which is operated by the National Observatory of Athens, the downtown area has an annual average temperature of 19.2 °C (66.6 °F) while parts of the urban agglomeration may reach up to 19.8 °C (67.6 °F), being affected by the urban heat island effect.[54] Athens receives about 433.1 millimetres (17.05 in) of precipitation per year, largely concentrated during the colder half of the year with the remaining rainfall falling sparsely, mainly during thunderstorms. Fog is rare in the city center, but somewhat more frequent in areas to the east, close to mount Hymettus.[55]\n\n\nThe southern section of the Athens metropolitan area (i.e., Elliniko, Athens Riviera) lies in the transitional zone between Mediterranean (*Csa*) and hot semi-arid climate (*BSh*), with its port-city of Piraeus being the most extreme example, receiving just 331.9 millimetres (13.07 in) per year. The areas to the south generally see less extreme temperature variations as their climate is moderated by the Saronic gulf.[56] The northern part of the city (i.e., Kifissia), owing to its higher elevation, features moderately lower temperatures and slightly increased precipitation year-round. The generally dry climate of the Athens basin compared to the precipitation amounts seen in a typical Mediterranean climate is due to the rain shadow effect caused by the Pindus mountain range and the Dirfys and Parnitha mountains, substantially drying the westerly[57] and northerly[55] winds respectively.\n\n\n\n![](image)Snowfall in Athens on 16 February 2021\nSnowfall is not very common, though it occurs almost annually, but it usually does not cause heavy disruption to daily life, in contrast to the northern parts of the city, where blizzards occur on a somewhat more regular basis. The most recent examples include the snowstorms of 16 February 2021[58] and 24 January 2022,[59] when the entire urban area was blanketed in snow.\n\n\nAthens may get particularly hot in the summer, owing partly to the strong urban heat island effect characterizing the city.[60] In fact, Athens is considered to be the hottest city in mainland Europe,[61] and it's the first city in Europe to appoint a chief heat officer to deal with severe heat waves.[62] Temperatures of 47.5°C have been reported in several locations of the metropolitan area, including within the urban agglomeration. Metropolitan Athens was until 2021 the holder of the World Meteorological Organization record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe with 48.0 °C (118.4 °F) which was recorded in the areas of Elefsina and Tatoi on 10 July 1977.[63][64]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for downtown Athens (1991–2020), Extremes (1890–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n |

following Nafplion, which was the provisional capital from 1829. The municipality (City) of Athens is also the capital of the Attica region. The term *Athens* can refer either to the Municipality of Athens, to Greater Athens or urban area, or to the entire Athens Metropolitan Area.\n\n\nThe large **City Centre** (Greek: Κέντρο της Αθήνας) of the Greek capital falls directly within the **Municipality of Athens** or **Athens Municipality** (Greek: Δήμος Αθηναίων)—also **City of Athens**. Athens Municipality is the largest in population size in Greece. Piraeus also forms a significant city centre on its own[73] within the Athens Urban Area and it is the second largest in population size within it.\n\n\n\n### Athens Urban Area[edit]\n\n\nThe **Athens Urban Area** (Greek: Πολεοδομικό Συγκρότημα Αθηνών), also known as **Urban Area of the Capital** (Greek: Πολεοδομικό Συγκρότημα Πρωτεύουσας) or **Greater Athens** (Greek: Ευρύτερη Αθήνα),[74] today consists of 40 municipalities, 35 of which make up what was referred to as the former Athens Prefecture municipalities, located within 4 regional units (North Athens, West Athens, Central Athens, South Athens); and a further 5 municipalities, which make up the former Piraeus Prefecture municipalities, located within the regional unit of Piraeus as mentioned above.\n\n\nThe Athens Municipality forms the core and center of Greater Athens, which in its turn consists of the Athens Municipality and 40 more municipalities, divided in four regional units (Central, North, South and West Athens), accounting for 2,611,713 people (in 2021)[3] within an area of 361 km2 (139 sq mi).[19] Until 2010, which made up the abolished Athens Prefecture and the municipality of Piraeus, the historic Athenian port, with 4 other municipalities make up the regional unit of Piraeus. The regional units of Central Athens, North Athens, South Athens, West Athens and Piraeus with part of East[75] and West Attica[76] regional units combined make up the continuous Athens Urban Area,[76][77][78] also called the \"Urban Area of the Capital\" or simply \"Athens\" (the most common use of the term), spanning over 412 km2 (159 sq mi),[79] with a population of 4,200,764 people as of 2021. The Athens Urban Area is considered to form the city of Athens as a whole, despite its administrative divisions, which is the largest in Greece and the 9th most populated urban area in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Municipalities of the former Athens prefecture**\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Central Athens**: | 1.

For example, Kifissia and Glyfada serve as inter-municipal centres for northern and southern suburbs respectively.\n\n\n\n![](image)View of Vila Atlantis, in Kifissia, designed by Ernst Ziller\n![](image)Beach in the southern suburb of Alimos, one of the many beaches in the southern coast of Athens\nThe Athens Metropolitan Area consists of 58[81] densely populated municipalities, sprawling around the Municipality of Athens (the City Centre) in virtually all directions. For the Athenians, all the urban municipalities surrounding the City Centre are called suburbs. According to their geographic location in relation to the City of Athens, the suburbs are divided into four zones; the northern suburbs (including Agios Stefanos, Dionysos, Ekali, Nea Erythraia, Kifissia, Kryoneri, Maroussi, Pefki, Lykovrysi, Metamorfosi, Nea Ionia, Nea Filadelfeia, Irakleio, Vrilissia, Melissia, Penteli, Chalandri, Agia Paraskevi, Gerakas, Pallini, Galatsi, Psychiko and Filothei); the southern suburbs (including Alimos, Nea Smyrni, Moschato, Tavros, Agios Ioannis Renti, Kallithea, Piraeus, Agios Dimitrios, Palaio Faliro, Elliniko, Glyfada, Lagonisi, Saronida, Argyroupoli, Ilioupoli, Varkiza, Voula, Vari and Vouliagmeni); the eastern suburbs (including Zografou, Dafni, Vyronas, Kaisariani, Cholargos and Papagou); and the western suburbs (including Peristeri, Ilion, Egaleo, Koridallos, Agia Varvara, Keratsini, Perama, Nikaia, Drapetsona, Chaidari, Petroupoli, Agioi Anargyroi, Ano Liosia, Aspropyrgos, Eleusina, Acharnes and Kamatero).\n\n\nThe Athens city coastline, extending from the major commercial port of Piraeus to the southernmost suburb of Varkiza for some 25 km (20 mi),[82] is also connected to the City Centre by tram.\n\n\nIn the northern suburb of Maroussi, the upgraded main Olympic Complex (known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The area has been redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of Palaio Faliro, also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport – named Elliniko – in the southern suburbs, into one of the largest landscaped parks in Europe, to be named the Hellenikon Metropolitan Park.[83]\n\n\nMany of the southern suburbs (such as Alimos, Palaio Faliro, Elliniko, Glyfada, Voula, Vouliagmeni and Varkiza) known as the Athens Riviera, host a number of sandy beaches, most of which are operated by the Greek National Tourism Organisation and require an entrance fee. Casinos operate on both Mount Parnitha, some 25 km (16 mi)[84] from downtown Athens (accessible by car or cable car), and the nearby town of Loutraki (accessible by car via the Athens – Corinth National Highway, or the Athens Suburban Railway).\n\n\n\n![](image)\nCoastline of Palaio Faliro\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of twin towns and sister cities in Greece\n\nThe concept of a partner city is used under different names in different countries, but they mean the same thing, that two cities in different countries assist each other as partners. Athens has quite a number of partners, whether as a \"twin\", a \"sister\", or a \"partner.\"\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Athens population distribution\nThe Municipality of Athens has an official population of 643,452 people (in 2021).[3] According to the 2021 Population and Housing Census, The four regional units that make up what is referred to as Greater Athens have a combined population of 2,611,713 . They together with the regional unit of Piraeus (Greater Piraeus) make up the dense Athens Urban Area which reaches a total population of 3,059,764 inhabitants (in 2021).[3]\n\n\nThe municipality (Center) of Athens is the most populous in Greece, with a population of 643,452 people (in 2021)[3] and an area of 38.96 km2 (15.04 sq mi),[18] forming the core of the Athens Urban Area within the Attica Basin. The incumbent Mayor of Athens is Kostas Bakoyannis of New Democracy. The municipality is divided into seven municipal districts which are mainly used for administrative purposes.[85]\n\n\nFor the Athenians the most popular way of dividing the downtown is through its neighbourhoods such as Pagkrati, Ampelokipoi, Goudi, Exarcheia, Patisia, Ilisia, Petralona, Plaka, Anafiotika, Koukaki, Kolonaki and Kypseli, each with its own distinct history and characteristics.\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan Area[edit]\n\n\nThe Athens Metropolitan Area, with an area of 2,928.717 km2 (1,131 sq mi) and inhabited by 3,744,059 people in 2021,[3] consists of the Athens Urban Area with the addition of the towns and villages of East and West Attica, which surround the dense urban area of the Greek capital. It actually sprawls over the whole peninsula of Attica, which is the best part of the region of Attica, excluding the islands.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Classification of regional units within Greater Athens, Athens Urban Area and Athens Metropolitan Area\n |\n| --- |\n| Regional unit | Population (2021)[3] | Land Area (km2)\n | Area\n |\n| Central Athens | 1,002,212\n | 87.4\n | **Greater Athens**2,611,713364.2 km2\n | **Athens Urban Area**3,059,764414.6 km2\n | **Athens Metropolitan Area** 3,744,0592931.6 km2\n |\n| North Athens | 601,163\n | 140.7\n |\n| South Athens | 529,455\n | 69.4\n |\n| West Athens | 478,883\n | 66.7\n |\n| Piraeus | 448,051\n | 50.4\n | **Greater Piraeus**448,05150.4 km2\n |\n| East Attica | 518,755\n | 1,513\n |\n| West Attica | 165,540\n | 1,004\n |\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nAthens ranks in the lowest percentage for the risk on frequency and severity of terrorist attacks according to the EU Global Terrorism Database (EIU 2007–2016 calculations). The city also ranked 35th in Digital Security, 21st on Health Security, 29th on Infrastructure Security and 41st on Personal Security globally in a 2017 The Economist Intelligence Unit report.[86] It also ranks as a very safe city (39th globally out of 162 cities overall) on the ranking of the safest and most dangerous countries.[87] As May 2022 the crime index from Numbeo places Athens at 56.33 (moderate), while its safety index is at 43.68.Crime in Athens[88] According to a Mercer 2019 Quality of Living Survey, Athens ranks 89th on the Mercer Quality of Living Survey ranking.[89]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)OTE headquarters in Marousi, the largest technology company in Greece\n![](image)National Bank of Greece, the largest Greek bank by total assets[90][91]\n![](image)Ermou street, the main commercial street of Athens\nAthens is the financial capital of Greece. According to data from 2014, Athens as a metropolitan economic area produced US$130 billion as GDP in PPP, which consists of nearly half of the production for the whole country. Athens was ranked 102nd in that year's list of global economic metropolises, while GDP per capita for the same year was 32,000 US-dollars.[92]\n\n\nAthens is one of the major economic centres in south-eastern Europe and is considered a regional economic power. The port of Piraeus, where big investments by COSCO have already been delivered during the recent decade, the completion of the new Cargo Centre in Thriasion,[93] the expansion of the Athens Metro and the Athens Tram, as well as the Hellenikon metropolitan park redevelopment in Elliniko and other urban projects, are the economic landmarks of the upcoming years.\n\n\nProminent Greek companies such as Hellas Sat, Hellenic Aerospace Industry, Mytilineos Holdings, Titan Cement, Hellenic Petroleum, Papadopoulos E.J., Folli Follie, Jumbo S.A., OPAP, and Cosmote have their headquarters in the metropolitan area of Athens. Multinational companies such as Ericsson, Sony, Siemens, Motorola, Samsung, Microsoft, Teleperformance, Novartis, Mondelez and Coca-Cola also have their regional research and development headquarters in the city.\n\n\nThe banking sector is represented by National Bank of Greece, Alpha Bank, Eurobank, and Piraeus Bank, while the Bank of Greece is also situated in the City Centre. The Athens Stock Exchange was severely hit by the Greek government-debt crisis and the decision of the government to proceed into capital controls during summer 2015. As a whole the economy of Athens and Greece was strongly affected, while data showed a change from long recession to growth of 1.4% from 2017 onwards.[94]\n\n\nTourism is also a leading contributor to the economy of the city, as one of Europe's top destinations for city-break tourism, and also the gateway for excursions to both the islands and other parts of the mainland. Greece attracted 26.5 million visitors in 2015, 30.1 million visitors in 2017, and over 33 million in 2018, making Greece one of the most visited countries in Europe and the world, and contributing 18% to the country's GDP. Athens welcomed more than 5 million tourists in 2018, and 1.4 million were \"city-breakers\"; this was an increase by over a million city-breakers since 2013.[95]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nAthens has been a destination for travellers since antiquity. Over the past decade, the city's infrastructure and social amenities have improved, in part because of its successful bid to stage the 2004 Olympic Games. The Greek Government, aided by the EU, has funded major infrastructure projects such as the state-of-the-art Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport,[96] the expansion of the Athens Metro system,[52] and the new Attiki Odos Motorway.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama from Mount Lycabettus, with a view of the Panathinaiko Stadium, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the Hellenic Parliament and the Acropolis of Athens\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public transport in Athens\n\n![](image)Athens railways network (Metro, Suburban Railway and Tram)\nAthens is the country's major transportation hub. The city has Greece's largest airport and its largest port; Piraeus, too, is the largest container transport port in the Mediterranean, and the largest passenger port in Europe.\n\n\nAthens is a major national hub for Intercity (Ktel) and international buses, as well as for domestic and international rail transport. Public transport is serviced by a variety of transportation means, making up the country's largest mass transit system. Transport for Athens operates a large bus and trolleybus fleet, the city's Metro, a Suburban Railway service[97] and a tram network, connecting the southern suburbs to the city centre.[98]\n\n\n\n### Bus transport[edit]\n\n\nOSY (Greek: ΟΣΥ) (Odikes Sygkoinonies S.A.), a subsidiary company of OASA (Athens urban transport organisation), is the main operator of buses and trolleybuses in Athens. As of 2017, its network consists of around 322 bus lines, spanning the Athens Metropolitan Area, and making up a fleet of 2,375 buses and trolleybuses. Of those 2,375, 619 buses run on compressed natural gas, making up the largest fleet of natural gas-powered buses in Europe, and 354 are electric-powered (trolleybuses). All of the 354 trolleybuses are equipped to run on diesel in case of power failure.[99]\n\n\nInternational links are provided by a number of private companies. National and regional bus links are provided by KTEL from two InterCity Bus Terminals; Kifissos Bus Terminal A and Liosion Bus Terminal B, both located in the north-western part of the city. *Kifissos* provides connections towards Peloponnese, North Greece, West Greece and some Ionian Islands, whereas *Liosion* is used for most of Central Greece.\n\n\n\n### Railways[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Athens Metro, Proastiakos, and Athens Tram\n\nAthens is the hub of the country's national railway system (OSE), connecting the capital with major cities across Greece and abroad (Istanbul, Sofia, Belgrade and Bucharest).\n\n\n\n![](image)Suburban rail (Proastiakos)\nThe Athens Suburban Railway, referred to as the *Proastiakos*, connects Athens International Airport to the city of Kiato, 106 km (66 mi)[100] west of Athens, via Larissa station, the city's central rail station and the port of Piraeus. The length of Athens's commuter rail network extends to 120 km (75 mi),[100] and is expected to stretch to 281 km (175 mi) by 2010.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Athens Metro train (3rd generation stock)\nThe Athens Metro is operated by STASY S.A. (Greek: ΣΤΑΣΥ) (Statheres Sygkoinonies S.A.), a subsidiary company of OASA (Athens urban transport organisation), which provides public transport throughout the Athens Urban Area. While its main purpose is transport, it also houses Greek artifacts found during the construction of the system.[101] The Athens Metro runs three metro lines, namely Line 1 (Green Line), Line 2 (Red Line) and Line 3 (Blue Line) lines, of which the first was constructed in 1869, and the other two largely during the 1990s, with the initial new sections opened in January 2000. Line 1 mostly runs at ground level and the other two (Line 2 & 3) routes run entirely underground. A fleet of 42 trains, using 252 carriages, operates on the network,[102] with a daily occupancy of 1,353,000 passengers.[103]\n\n\n*Line 1* (Green Line) serves 24 stations, and is the oldest line of the Athens metro network. It runs from Piraeus station to Kifissia station and covers a distance of 25.6 km (15.9 mi). There are transfer connections with the Blue Line 3 at Monastiraki station and with the Red Line 2 at Omonia and Attiki stations. *Line 2* (Red Line) runs from Anthoupoli station to Elliniko station and covers a distance of 17.5 km (10.9 mi).[102] The line connects the western suburbs of Athens with the southeast suburbs, passing through the center of Athens. The Red Line has transfer connections with the Green Line 1 at Attiki and Omonia stations. There are also transfer connections with the Blue Line 3 at Syntagma station and with the tram at Syntagma, Syngrou Fix and Neos Kosmos stations. *Line 3* (Blue Line) runs from Dimotiko Theatro station, through the central Monastiraki and Syntagma stations to Doukissis Plakentias avenue in the northeastern suburb of Halandri.[102] It then ascends to ground level and continues to Athens International Airport Eleftherios Venizelos using the suburban railway infrastructure, extending its total length to 39 km (24 mi).[102] The spring 2007 extension from Monastiraki westwards to Egaleo connected some of the main night life hubs of the city, namely those of Gazi (Kerameikos station) with Psirri (Monastiraki station) and the city centre (Syntagma station).The new stations Maniatika, Piraeus and Dimotiko Theatro, were completed in October 10, 2022,[104][105] connecting the biggest port of Greece, the Port of Piraeus, with Athens International Airport, the biggest airport of Greece.\n\n\n\n![](image)Vehicle of the Athens Tram\nThe Athens Tram is operated by STASY S.A. (Statheres Sygkoinonies S.A.), a subsidiary company of Transport for Athens (OASA). It has a fleet of 35 Sirio type vehicles[106] and 25 Alstom Citadis type vehicles[107] which serve 48 stations,[106] employ 345 people with an average daily occupancy of 65,000 passengers.[106] The tram network spans a total length of 27 km (17 mi) and covers ten Athenian suburbs.[106] The network runs from Syntagma Square to the southwestern suburb of Palaio Faliro, where the line splits in two branches; the first runs along the Athens coastline toward the southern suburb of Voula, while the other heads toward Neo Faliro. The network covers the majority of the Athens coastline.[108] Further extension is under construction towards the major commercial port of Piraeus.[106] The expansion to Piraeus will include 12 new stations, increase the overall length of tram route by 5.4 km (3 mi), and increase the overall transportation network.[109]\n\n\n\n### Athens International Airport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Athens International Airport\n\n![](image)Athens International Airport\nAthens is served by the Athens International Airport (ATH), located near the town of Spata, in the eastern Messoghia plain, some 35 km (22 mi) east of center of Athens.[110] The airport, awarded the \"European Airport of the Year 2004\" Award,[111] is intended as an expandable hub for air travel in southeastern Europe and was constructed in 51 months, costing 2.2 billion euros. It employs a staff of 14,000.[111]\n\n\n\n### Ferry[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of Piraeus is the largest port in Greece and one of the largest in Europe. Rafina and Lavrio act as alternative ports of Athens, connects the city with numerous Greek islands of the Aegean Sea, Evia and Çeşme in Turkey,[112][113] while also serving the cruise ships that arrive.\n\n\n\n### Motorways[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: National Roads and Motorways in Greece\n\n![](image)Aerial view of an A6 interchange north of Athens\nTwo main motorways of Greece begin in Athens, namely the A1/E75, heading north towards Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki; and the border crossing of Evzones and the A8/E94 heading west, towards Greece's third largest city, Patras, which incorporated the GR-8A. Before their completion much of the road traffic used the GR-1 and the GR-8.\n\n\nAthens' Metropolitan Area is served by the motorway network of the Attiki Odos toll-motorway (code: A6). Its main section extends from the western industrial suburb of Elefsina to Athens International Airport; while two beltways, namely the Aigaleo Beltway (A65) and the Hymettus Beltway (A64) serve parts of western and eastern Athens respectively. The span of the Attiki Odos in all its length is 65 km (40 mi),[114] making it the largest metropolitan motorway network in all of Greece.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Facade of the Academy of Athens\n![](image)University of Athens\n![](image)The National Library of Greece.\nLocated on Panepistimiou Street, the old campus of the University of Athens, the National Library, and the Athens Academy form the \"Athens Trilogy\" built in the mid-19th century. The largest and oldest university in Athens is the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Most of the functions of NKUA have been transferred to a campus in the eastern suburb of Zografou. The National Technical University of Athens is located on Patision Street.\n\n\nThe University of West Attica is the second largest university in Athens. The seat of the university is located in the western area of Athens, where the philosophers of Ancient Athens delivered lectures. All the activities of UNIWA are carried out in the modern infrastructure of the three University Campuses within the metropolitan region of Athens (Egaleo Park, Ancient Olive Groove and Athens), which offer modern teaching and research spaces, entertainment and support facilities for all students. Other universities that lie within Athens are the Athens University of Economics and Business, the Panteion University, the Agricultural University of Athens and the University of Piraeus.\n\n\nThere are overall ten state-supported Institutions of Higher (or Tertiary) education located in the Athens Urban Area, these are by chronological order: Athens School of Fine Arts (1837), National Technical University of Athens (1837), National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (1837), Agricultural University of Athens (1920), Athens University of Economics and Business (1920), Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences (1927), University of Piraeus (1938), Harokopio University of Athens (1990), School of Pedagogical and Technological Education (2002), University of West Attica (2018). There are also several other private *colleges*, as they called formally in Greece, as the establishment of private universities is prohibited by the constitution. Many of them are accredited by a foreign state or university such as the American College of Greece and the Athens Campus of the University of Indianapolis.[115]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Greece\n\n### Archaeological hub and museums[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of museums in Greece\n\n![](image)The National Archaeological Museum in central Athens\n![](image)The Acropolis Museum\n![](image)Museum of the Ancient Agora in the Stoa of Attalos\nThe city is a world centre of archaeological research. Alongside national academic institutions, such as the Athens University and the Archaeological Society, it is home to multiple archaeological museums, taking in the National Archaeological Museum, the Cycladic Museum, the Epigraphic Museum, the Byzantine & Christian Museum, as well as museums at the ancient Agora, Acropolis, Kerameikos, and the Kerameikos Archaeological Museum. The city is also the setting for the Demokritos laboratory for Archaeometry, alongside regional and national archaeological authorities forming part of the Greek Department of Culture.\n\n\nAthens hosts 17 Foreign Archaeological Institutes which promote and facilitate research by scholars from their home countries. As a result, Athens has more than a dozen archaeological libraries and three specialized archaeological laboratories, and is the venue of several hundred specialized lectures, conferences and seminars, as well as dozens of archaeological exhibitions each year. At any given time, hundreds of international scholars and researchers in all disciplines of archaeology are to be found in the city.\n\n\nAthens' most important museums include:\n\n\n\n* the National Archaeological Museum, the largest archaeological museum in the country, and one of the most important internationally, as it contains a vast collection of antiquities. Its artefacts cover a period of more than 5,000 years, from late Neolithic Age to Roman Greece;\n* the Benaki Museum with its several branches for each of its collections including ancient, Byzantine, Ottoman-era, Chinese art and beyond;\n* the Byzantine and Christian Museum, one of the most important museums of Byzantine art;\n* the National Art Gallery, the nation's eponymous leading gallery, which reopened in 2021 after renovation;\n* the National Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in 2000 in a former brewery building;\n* the Numismatic Museum, housing a major collection of ancient and modern coins;\n* the Museum of Cycladic Art, home to an extensive collection of Cycladic art, including its famous figurines of white marble;\n* the New Acropolis Museum, opened in 2009, and replacing the old museum on the Acropolis. The new museum has proved considerably popular; almost one million people visited during the summer period June–October 2009 alone. A number of smaller and privately owned museums focused on Greek culture and arts are also to be found.\n* the Kerameikos Archaeological Museum, a museum which displays artifacts from the burial site of Kerameikos. Much of the pottery and other artifacts relate to Athenian attitudes towards death and the afterlife, throughout many ages.\n* the Jewish Museum of Greece, a museum which describes the history and culture of the Greek Jewish community.\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Modern architecture in Athens\n\n![](image)The Zappeion Hall\n![](image)The Cathedral of Athens (Athens Metropolis)\nAthens incorporates architectural styles ranging from Greco-Roman and Neoclassical to Modern. They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict height restriction laws in order to ensure the Acropolis Hill is visible throughout the city. Despite the variety in styles, there is evidence of continuity in elements of the architectural environment throughout the city's history.[116]\n\n\nFor the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as Eclecticism, especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the Old Royal Palace was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, Theophil Freiherr von Hansen and Ernst Ziller took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the Athens Academy and the Zappeion Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as Schliemann's Iliou Melathron.\n\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, modern architecture including Bauhaus and Art Deco began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include Kolonaki, and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include Kypseli.[117]\n\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s during the extension and development of Athens, other modern movements such as the International style played an important role. The centre of Athens was largely rebuilt, leading to the demolition of a number of neoclassical buildings. The architects of this era employed materials such as glass, marble and aluminium, and many blended modern and classical elements.[118] After World War II, internationally known architects to have designed and built in the city included Walter Gropius, with his design for the US Embassy, and, among others, Eero Saarinen, in his postwar design for the east terminal of the Ellinikon Airport.\n\n\n\n### Urban sculpture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Old Parliament House, now home to the National History Museum. View from Stadiou Street.\nAcross the city numerous statues or busts are to be found. Apart from the neoclassicals by Leonidas Drosis at the Academy of Athens (Plato, Socrates, Apollo and Athena), others in notable categories include the statue of Theseus by Georgios Fytalis at Thiseion; depictions of philhellenes such as Lord Byron, George Canning, and William Gladstone; the equestrian statue of Theodoros Kolokotronis by Lazaros Sochos in front of the Old Parliament; statues of Ioannis Kapodistrias, Rigas Feraios and Adamantios Korais at the University; of Evangelos Zappas and Konstantinos Zappas at the Zappeion; Ioannis Varvakis at the National Garden; the\" Woodbreaker\" by Dimitrios Filippotis; the equestrian statue of Alexandros Papagos in the Papagou district; and various busts of fighters of Greek independence at the Pedion tou Areos. A significant landmark is also the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Syntagma.\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Theatre of Greece, near Omonoia Square\nAthens is home to 148 theatrical stages, more than any other city in the world, including the ancient Odeon of Herodes Atticus, home to the Athens Festival, which runs from May to October each year.[119][120] In addition to a large number of multiplexes, Athens plays host to open air garden cinemas. The city also supports music venues, including the Athens Concert Hall (*Megaro Moussikis*), which attracts world class artists.[121] The Athens Planetarium,[122] located in Andrea Syngrou Avenue, in Palaio Faliro[123] is one of the largest and best equipped digital planetaria in the world.[124] The Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, inaugurated in 2016, will house the National Library of Greece and the Greek National Opera.[125] In 2018 Athens was designated as the World Book Capital by UNESCO.[126]\n\n\nRestaurants, tavernas and bars can be found in the entertainment hubs in Plaka and the Trigono areas of the historic centre, the inner suburbs of Gazi and Psyrri are especially busy with nightclubs and bars, while Kolonaki, Exarchia, Metaxourgeio, Koukaki and Pangrati offer more of a cafe and restaurant scene. The coastal suburbs of Microlimano, Alimos and Glyfada include many tavernas, beach bars and busy summer clubs.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Centre, home of the Greek National Opera and the new National Library\nThe most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the Athenian serenades (Αθηναϊκές καντάδες), based on the Heptanesean kantádhes (καντάδες 'serenades'; sing.: καντάδα) and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια 'theatrical revue songs') in revues, musical comedies, operettas and nocturnes that were dominating Athens' theatre scene.\n\n\nIn 1922, following the war, genocide and later population exchange suffered by the Greek population of Asia Minor, many ethnic Greeks fled to Athens. They settled in poor neighbourhoods and brought with them Rebetiko music, making it also popular in Greece, and which later became the base for the Laïko music. Other forms of song popular today in Greece are elafrolaika, entechno, dimotika, and skyladika.[127] Greece's most notable, and internationally famous, composers of Greek song, mainly of the entechno form, are Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis. Both composers have achieved fame abroad for their composition of film scores.[127]\n\n\nThe renowned American-born Greek soprano Maria Callas spent her teenage years in Athens, where she settled in 1937.[128][129] Her professional opera career started in 1940 in Athens, with the Greek National Opera.[130] In 2018, the city's municipal Olympia Theatre was renamed to \"Olympia City Music Theatre 'Maria Callas'\"[131][132] and in 2023, the Municipality inaugurated the Maria Callas Museum, housing it in a neoclassical building on 44 Mitropoleos street.[133]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of sports clubs in Athens Municipality\n\n![](image)The Panathenaic Stadium of Athens (Kallimarmaron) dates back to the fourth century BC and has hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.\nFile:Aerial view of Olympic complex in Athens 2004 DSC06793.jpgAthens Olympic Sports Complex\nFile:GIPEDO AEK-1.jpgAgia Sophia Stadium\nAthens has a long tradition in sports and sporting events, serving as home to the most important clubs in Greek sport and housing a large number of sports facilities. The city has also been host to sports events of international importance.\n\n\nAthens has hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, in 1896 and 2004. The 2004 Summer Olympics required the development of the Athens Olympic Stadium, which has since gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world, and one of its most interesting modern monuments.[134] The biggest stadium in the country, it hosted two finals of the UEFA Champions League, in 1994 and 2007. Athens' other major stadiums are the Karaiskakis Stadium located in Piraeus, a sports and entertainment complex, host of the 1971 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, and Agia Sophia Stadium located in Nea Filadelfeia.\n\n\nAthens has hosted the EuroLeague final three times, the first in 1985 and second in 1993, both at the Peace and Friendship Stadium, most known as SEF, a large indoor arena,[135] and the third time in 2007 at the Olympic Indoor Hall. Events in other sports such as athletics, volleyball, water polo etc., have been hosted in the capital's venues.\n\n\nAthens is home to three European multi-sport clubs: Panathinaikos, originated in Athens city centre, Olympiacos, originated in the suburb of Piraeus and AEK Athens, originated in the suburb of Nea Filadelfeia. In football, Panathinaikos made it to the 1971 European Cup Final, Olympiacos have dominated domestic competitions, while AEK Athens is the other member of the big three. These clubs also have basketball teams; Panathinaikos and Olympiacos are among the top powers in European basketball, having won the Euroleague six times and three respectively, whilst AEK Athens was the first Greek team to win a European trophy in any team sport.\n\n\nOther notable clubs within Athens are Athinaikos, Panionios, Atromitos, Apollon, Panellinios, Egaleo F.C., Ethnikos Piraeus, Maroussi BC and Peristeri B.C. Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports.\n\n\nThe Athens area encompasses a variety of terrain, notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a mountain range. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of kilometres of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on foot and bike.\n\n\nBeyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include skiing, rock climbing, hang gliding and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the Sierra Club, which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.\n\n\nAthens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in Lausanne, Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics, to Atlanta, United States.[21] It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.[21] Prior to this round, the cities of Buenos Aires, Stockholm and Cape Town had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.[21] Although the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5 billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern urban development.[136] The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from all 202 countries.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Athens\n* Timeline of Athens\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Athens: City of Wisdom\".

With its urban area's population numbering over three million, it is also the eighth largest urban area in the European Union. Athens dominates and is the capital of the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years,[6] and its earliest human presence beginning somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. The city was named after Athena, the ancient Greek goddess of wisdom.[7]\n\n\nClassical Athens was one of the most powerful city-states in ancient Greece. It was a centre for democracy, the arts, education and philosophy,[8][9] and was highly influential throughout the European continent, particularly in Ancient Rome.[10] For this reason, it is often regarded as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy in its own right independently from the rest of Greece.[11][12] In modern times, Athens is a huge cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2023, Athens metropolitan area and its surrounding municipalities (consisting the regional area of Attica) has a population of approximately 3.8 million.[13][14]\n\n\nAthens is a Beta-status global city according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network,[15] and is one of the biggest economic centers in Southeastern Europe. It also has a large financial sector, and its port Piraeus is both the 2nd busiest passenger port in Europe,[16] and the 13th largest container port in the world.[17] The Municipality of Athens (also City of Athens), which constitutes a small administrative unit of the entire urban area, had a population of 698.567 (in 2023)[3] within its official limits, and a land area of 38.96 km2 (15.04 sq mi).[18][19] The Athens metropolitan area or Greater Athens[20] extends beyond its administrative municipal city limits as well as its urban agglomeration, with a population of 4,207,281 (in 2023)[3] over an area of 2,928.717 km2 (1,131 sq mi).[19] Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland.\n\n\nThe heritage of the Classical Era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments, and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western culture. The city also retains Roman, Byzantine and a smaller number of Ottoman monuments, while its historical urban core features elements of continuity through its millennia of history. Athens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery. Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the Hellenic Parliament and the Architectural Trilogy of Athens, consisting of the National Library of Greece, the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and the Academy of Athens. Athens is also home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the National Archeological Museum, featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the Acropolis Museum, the Museum of Cycladic Art, the Benaki Museum, and the Byzantine and Christian Museum. Athens was the host city of the first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896, and 108 years later it hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics, making it one of five cities to have hosted the Summer Olympics on multiple occasions.[21] Athens joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and names[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of European cities in different languages (A)\n\nIn Ancient Greek, the name of the city was Ἀθῆναι (*Athênai*, pronounced [atʰɛ̂ːnai̯] in Classical Attic) a plural. In earlier Greek, such as Homeric Greek, the name had been current in the singular form though, as Ἀθήνη (*Athḗnē*).[22] It was possibly rendered in the plural later on, like those of Θῆβαι (*Thêbai*) and Μυκῆναι (*Μukênai*). The root of the word is probably not of Greek or Indo-European origin,[23] and is possibly a remnant of the Pre-Greek substrate of Attica.[23] In antiquity, it was debated whether Athens took its name from its patron goddess Athena (Attic Ἀθηνᾶ, *Athēnâ*, Ionic Ἀθήνη, *Athḗnē*, and Doric Ἀθάνα, *Athā́nā*) or Athena took her name from the city.[24] Modern scholars now generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city,[24] because the ending -*ene* is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names.[24]\n\n\nAccording to the ancient Athenian founding myth, Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, competed against Poseidon, the God of the Seas, for patronage of the yet-unnamed city;[25] they agreed that whoever gave the Athenians the better gift would become their patron[25] and appointed Cecrops, the king of Athens, as the judge.[25] According to the account given by Pseudo-Apollodorus, Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and a salt water spring welled up.[25] In an alternative version of the myth from Vergil's poem *Georgics*, Poseidon instead gave the Athenians the first horse.[25] In both versions, Athena offered the Athenians the first domesticated olive tree.[25][26] Cecrops accepted this gift[25] and declared Athena the patron goddess of Athens.[25][26] Eight different etymologies, now commonly rejected, have been proposed since the 17th century. Christian Lobeck proposed as the root of the name the word ἄθος (*áthos*) or ἄνθος (*ánthos*) meaning \"flower\", to denote Athens as the \"flowering city\". Ludwig von Döderlein proposed the stem of the verb θάω, stem θη- (*tháō*, *thē-*, \"to suck\") to denote Athens as having fertile soil.[27] Athenians were called cicada-wearers (Ancient Greek: Τεττιγοφόροι) because they used to wear pins of golden cicadas. A symbol of being autochthonous (earth-born), because the legendary founder of Athens, Erechtheus was an autochthon or of being musicians, because the cicada is a \"musician\" insect.[28] In classical literature, the city was sometimes referred to as the City of the Violet Crown, first documented in Pindar's ἰοστέφανοι Ἀθᾶναι (*iostéphanoi Athânai*), or as τὸ κλεινὸν ἄστυ (*tò kleinòn ásty*, \"the glorious city\").\n\n\nDuring the medieval period, the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular as Ἀθήνα. Variant names included Setines, Satine, and Astines, all derivations involving false splitting of prepositional phrases.[29] King Alphonse X of Castile gives the pseudo-etymology 'the one without death/ignorance'.[30][*page needed*] In Ottoman Turkish, it was called آتينا *Ātīnā*,[31] and in modern Turkish, it is *Atina*.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Athens\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Athens.\n\nHistorical affiliations\n\n\n> \n> Kingdom of Athens 1556 BC–1068 BC  \n> \n> City-state of Athens 1068 BC–322 BC  \n> \n> Hellenic League 338 BC–322 BC  \n> \n> Kingdom of Macedonia 322 BC–148 BC  \n> \n> Roman Republic 146 BC–27 BC  \n> \n> Roman Empire 27 BC–395 AD  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 395–1205  \n> \n> ![](image) Duchy of Athens 1205–1458  \n> \n> ![](image) Ottoman Empire 1458–1822, 1827–1832  \n> \n> ![](image) Greece 1822–1827, 1832–present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Classical Athens, Hellenistic Greece, and Roman Greece\n\nThe oldest known human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist, which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th millennia BC.[7] Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 5,000 years (3000 BC).[32][33] By 1400 BC, the settlement had become an important centre of the Mycenaean civilization, and the Acropolis was the site of a major Mycenaean fortress, whose remains can be recognised from sections of the characteristic Cyclopean walls.[34] Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as Mycenae and Pylos, it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200 BC, an event often attributed to a Dorian invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were pure Ionians with no Dorian element. However, Athens, like many other Bronze Age settlements, went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.[35] Iron Age burials, in the Kerameikos[36] and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900 BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.[37]\n\n\nBy the sixth century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of Solon. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by Cleisthenes in 508 BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the rebellion of the Ionian cities against Persian rule. In the ensuing Greco-Persian Wars Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at Marathon in 490 BC, and crucially at Salamis in 480 BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being captured and sacked twice by the Persians within one year, after a heroic but ultimately failed resistance at Thermopylae by Spartans and other Greeks led by King Leonidas,[38] after both Boeotia and Attica fell to the Persians.\n\n\n\n![](image)Delian League under the leadership of Athens before the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC\nThe decades that followed became known as the Golden Age of Athenian democracy, during which time Athens became the leading city of Ancient Greece, with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for Western civilization.[11][12] The playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates, and the philosopher Socrates. Guided by Pericles, who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the Parthenon), as well as empire-building via the Delian League. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival Sparta.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Acropolis hill in Athens\nBy the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of Macedon was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338 BC the armies of Philip II defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a free city because of its widely admired schools. In the second century AD, The Roman emperor Hadrian, himself an Athenian citizen,[40] ordered the construction of a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the Temple of Olympian Zeus.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tower of the Winds in the Roman Agora, the second commercial centre of ancient Athens\nIn the early 4th century AD, the Eastern Roman Empire began to be governed from Constantinople, and with the construction and expansion of the imperial city, many of Athens's works of art were taken by the emperors to adorn it. The Empire became Christianized, and the use of Latin declined in favour of exclusive use of Greek; in the Roman imperial period, both languages had been used. In the later Roman period, Athens was ruled by the emperors continuing until the 13th century, its citizens identifying themselves as citizens of the Roman Empire (\"*Rhomaioi*\"). The conversion of the empire from paganism to Christianity greatly affected Athens, resulting in reduced reverence for the city.[33] Ancient monuments such as the Parthenon, Erechtheion and the Hephaisteion (Theseion) were converted into churches. As the empire became increasingly anti-pagan, Athens became a provincial town and experienced fluctuating fortunes.\n\n\nThe city remained an important center of learning, especially of Neoplatonism—with notable pupils including Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil of Caesarea and emperor Julian (r. 355–363)—and consequently a center of paganism. Christian items do not appear in the archaeological record until the early 5th century.[41] The sack of the city by the Herules in 267 and by the Visigoths under their king Alaric I (r. 395–410) in 396, however, dealt a heavy blow to the city's fabric and fortunes, and Athens was henceforth confined to a small fortified area that embraced a fraction of the ancient city.[41] The emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) banned the teaching of philosophy by pagans in 529,[42] an event whose impact on the city is much debated,[41] but is generally taken to mark the end of the ancient history of Athens. Athens was sacked by the Slavs in 582, but remained in imperial hands thereafter, as highlighted by the visit of the emperor Constans II (r. 641–668) in 662/3 and its inclusion in the Theme of Hellas.[41]\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Byzantine Greece and Duchy of Athens\n\n![](image)The Byzantine Church of the Holy Apostles next to the Stoa of Attalos\nThe city was threatened by Saracen raids in the 8th–9th centuries—in 896, Athens was raided and possibly occupied for a short period, an event which left some archaeological remains and elements of Arabic ornamentation in contemporary buildings[43]—but there is also evidence of a mosque existing in the city at the time.[41] In the great dispute over Byzantine Iconoclasm, Athens is commonly held to have supported the iconophile position, chiefly due to the role played by Empress Irene of Athens in the ending of the first period of Iconoclasm at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.[41] A few years later, another Athenian, Theophano, became empress as the wife of Staurakios (r. 811–812).[41]\n\n\nInvasion of the empire by the Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, and the ensuing civil wars, largely passed the region by and Athens continued its provincial existence unharmed. When the Byzantine Empire was rescued by the resolute leadership of the three Komnenos emperors Alexios, John and Manuel, Attica and the rest of Greece prospered. Archaeological evidence tells us that the medieval town experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the 11th century and continuing until the end of the 12th century.\n\n\n\n![](image)Frankish Tower of the Acropolis of Athens\nThe Agora (marketplace) had been deserted since late antiquity, began to be built over, and soon the town became an important centre for the production of soaps and dyes. The growth of the town attracted the Venetians, and various other traders who frequented the ports of the Aegean, to Athens. This interest in trade appears to have further increased the economic prosperity of the town.\n\n\nThe 11th and 12th centuries were the Golden Age of Byzantine art in Athens. Almost all of the most important Middle Byzantine churches in and around Athens were built during these two centuries, and this reflects the growth of the town in general. However, this medieval prosperity was not to last. In 1204, the Fourth Crusade conquered Athens and the city was not recovered from the Latins before it was taken by the Ottoman Turks. It did not become Greek in government again until the 19th century.\n\n\nFrom 1204 until 1458, Athens was ruled by Latins in three separate periods, following the Crusades. The \"Latins\", or \"Franks\", were western Europeans and followers of the Latin Church brought to the Eastern Mediterranean during the Crusades. Along with rest of Byzantine Greece, Athens was part of the series of feudal fiefs, similar to the Crusader states established in Syria and on Cyprus after the First Crusade. This period is known as the *Frankokratia*.\n\n\n\n### Ottoman Athens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ottoman Greece\n\n![](image)Tzistarakis Mosque, an Ottoman mosque, built in 1759, in Monastiraki Square\nThe first Ottoman attack on Athens, which involved a short-lived occupation of the town, came in 1397, under the Ottoman generals Yaqub Pasha and Timurtash.[43] Finally, in 1458, Athens was captured by the Ottomans under the personal leadership of Sultan Mehmed II.[43] As the Ottoman Sultan rode into the city, he was greatly struck by the beauty of its ancient monuments and issued a *firman* (imperial edict) forbidding their looting or destruction, on pain of death. The Parthenon was converted into the main mosque of the city.[33]\n\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, Athens was denuded of any importance and its population severely declined, leaving it as a \"small country town\" (Franz Babinger).[43] From the early 17th century, Athens came under the jurisdiction of the Kizlar Agha, the chief black eunuch of the Sultan's harem. The city had originally been granted by Sultan Ahmed I (r. 1603–1617) to Basilica, one of his favourite concubines, who hailed from the city, in response of complaints of maladministration by the local governors. After her death, Athens came under the purview of the Kizlar Agha.[44]\n\n\nThe Turks began a practice of storing gunpowder and explosives in the Parthenon and Propylaea. In 1640, a lightning bolt struck the Propylaea, causing its destruction.[45] In 1687, during the Morean War, the Acropolis was besieged by the Venetians under Francesco Morosini, and the temple of Athena Nike was dismantled by the Ottomans to fortify the Parthenon. A shot fired during the bombardment of the Acropolis caused a powder magazine in the Parthenon to explode (26 September), and the building was severely damaged, giving it largely the appearance it has today. The Venetian occupation of Athens lasted for six months, and both the Venetians and the Ottomans participated in the looting of the Parthenon. One of its western pediments was removed, causing even more damage to the structure.[33][43] During the Venetian occupation, the two mosques of the city were converted into Catholic and Protestant churches, but on 9 April 1688 the Venetians abandoned Athens again to the Ottomans.[43]\n\n\n\n### Modern history[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Greek War of Independence, Kingdom of Greece, and Republic of Greece\n\n![](image)*The Entry of King Otto in Athens*, Peter von Hess, 1839\nIn 1822, a Greek insurgency captured the city, but it fell to the Ottomans again in 1826 (though Acropolis held till June 1827). Again the ancient monuments suffered badly. The Ottoman forces remained in possession until March 1833, when they withdrew. At that time, the city (as throughout the Ottoman period) had a small population of an estimated 400 houses, mostly located around the Acropolis in the Plaka.\n\n\nFollowing the Greek War of Independence and the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, Athens was chosen to replace Nafplio as the second capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons.[46] At the time, after the extensive destruction it had suffered during the war of independence, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people (less than half its earlier population) in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first King of Greece, Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Olympic Flame at the opening ceremony of the 2004 Summer Olympics\nThe first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the Acropolis, the ancient cemetery of Kerameikos and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the Greek Parliament), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital.[*citation needed*] In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern Olympic Games. During the 1920s a number of Greek refugees, expelled from Asia Minor after the Greco-Turkish War and Greek genocide, swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following World War II, and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded,[*citation needed*] and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge.[*citation needed*] A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the Attiki Odos motorway, the expansion of the Athens Metro, and the new Athens International Airport), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004, Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Athens Urban Area within the Attica Basin from space\nAthens sprawls across the central plain of Attica that is often referred to as the **Athens Basin** or the **Attica Basin** (Greek: Λεκανοπέδιο Αθηνών/Αττικής). The basin is bounded by four large mountains: Mount Aigaleo to the west, Mount Parnitha to the north, Mount Pentelicus to the northeast and Mount Hymettus to the east.[47] Beyond Mount Aegaleo lies the Thriasian plain, which forms an extension of the central plain to the west. The Saronic Gulf lies to the southwest. Mount Parnitha is the tallest of the four mountains (1,413 m (4,636 ft)),[48] and has been declared a national park. The Athens urban area spreads over 50 kilometres (31 mi) from Agios Stefanos in the north to Varkiza in the south. The city is located in the north temperate zone, 38 degrees north of the equator.\n\n\nAthens is built around a number of hills. Lycabettus is one of the tallest hills of the city proper and provides a view of the entire Attica Basin. The meteorology of Athens is deemed to be one of the most complex in the world because its mountains cause a temperature inversion phenomenon which, along with the Greek government's difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air pollution problems the city has faced.[33] This issue is not unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and Mexico City also suffer from similar atmospheric inversion problems.[33]\n\n\nThe Cephissus river, the Ilisos and the Eridanos stream are the historical rivers of Athens.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smog in Athens\nBy the late 1970s, the pollution of Athens had become so destructive that according to the then Greek Minister of Culture, Constantine Trypanis, \"...the carved details on the five the caryatids of the Erechtheum had seriously degenerated, while the face of the horseman on the Parthenon's west side was all but obliterated.\"[49] A series of measures taken by the authorities of the city throughout the 1990s resulted in the improvement of air quality; the appearance of smog (or *nefos* as the Athenians used to call it) has become less common.\n\n\nMeasures taken by the Greek authorities throughout the 1990s have improved the quality of air over the Attica Basin. Nevertheless, air pollution still remains an issue for Athens, particularly during the hottest summer days. In late June 2007,[50] the Attica region experienced a number of brush fires,[50] including a blaze that burned a significant portion of a large forested national park in Mount Parnitha,[51] considered critical to maintaining a better air quality in Athens all year round.[50] Damage to the park has led to worries over a stalling in the improvement of air quality in the city.[50]\n\n\nThe major waste management efforts undertaken in the last decade (particularly the plant built on the small island of Psytalia) have greatly improved water quality in the Saronic Gulf, and the coastal waters of Athens are now accessible again to swimmers.\n\n\n\n#### Parks and zoos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Pedion tou Areos park\n![](image)The entrance of the National Gardens, commissioned by Queen Amalia in 1838 and completed by 1840\nParnitha National Park is punctuated by well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves dotting the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains are popular outdoor activities for residents of the city. The National Garden of Athens was completed in 1840 and is a green refuge of 15.5 hectares in the centre of the Greek capital. It is to be found between the Parliament and Zappeion buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares. Parts of the City Centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the *Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens*, which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project.[52][53] The landmark Dionysiou Areopagitou Street has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the Temple of Olympian Zeus at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near Plaka, and finishes just beyond the Temple of Hephaestus in Thiseio. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the Parthenon and the Agora (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy City Centre.\n\n\nThe hills of Athens also provide green space. Lycabettus, Philopappos hill and the area around it, including Pnyx and Ardettos hill, are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland. Also to be found is the Pedion tou Areos (*Field of Mars*) of 27.7 hectares, near the National Archaeological Museum. Athens' largest zoo is the Attica Zoological Park, a 20-hectare (49-acre) private zoo located in the suburb of Spata. The zoo is home to around 2000 animals representing 400 species, and is open 365 days a year. Smaller zoos exist within public gardens or parks, such as the zoo within the National Garden of Athens.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sunrise in Athens\nAthens has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: *Csa*). According to the meteorological station near the city center which is operated by the National Observatory of Athens, the downtown area has an annual average temperature of 19.2 °C (66.6 °F) while parts of the urban agglomeration may reach up to 19.8 °C (67.6 °F), being affected by the urban heat island effect.[54] Athens receives about 433.1 millimetres (17.05 in) of precipitation per year, largely concentrated during the colder half of the year with the remaining rainfall falling sparsely, mainly during thunderstorms. Fog is rare in the city center, but somewhat more frequent in areas to the east, close to mount Hymettus.[55]\n\n\nThe southern section of the Athens metropolitan area (i.e., Elliniko, Athens Riviera) lies in the transitional zone between Mediterranean (*Csa*) and hot semi-arid climate (*BSh*), with its port-city of Piraeus being the most extreme example, receiving just 331.9 millimetres (13.07 in) per year. The areas to the south generally see less extreme temperature variations as their climate is moderated by the Saronic gulf.[56] The northern part of the city (i.e., Kifissia), owing to its higher elevation, features moderately lower temperatures and slightly increased precipitation year-round. The generally dry climate of the Athens basin compared to the precipitation amounts seen in a typical Mediterranean climate is due to the rain shadow effect caused by the Pindus mountain range and the Dirfys and Parnitha mountains, substantially drying the westerly[57] and northerly[55] winds respectively.\n\n\n\n![](image)Snowfall in Athens on 16 February 2021\nSnowfall is not very common, though it occurs almost annually, but it usually does not cause heavy disruption to daily life, in contrast to the northern parts of the city, where blizzards occur on a somewhat more regular basis. The most recent examples include the snowstorms of 16 February 2021[58] and 24 January 2022,[59] when the entire urban area was blanketed in snow.\n\n\nAthens may get particularly hot in the summer, owing partly to the strong urban heat island effect characterizing the city.[60] In fact, Athens is considered to be the hottest city in mainland Europe,[61] and it's the first city in Europe to appoint a chief heat officer to deal with severe heat waves.[62] Temperatures of 47.5°C have been reported in several locations of the metropolitan area, including within the urban agglomeration. Metropolitan Athens was until 2021 the holder of the World Meteorological Organization record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe with 48.0 °C (118.4 °F) which was recorded in the areas of Elefsina and Tatoi on 10 July 1977.[63][64]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for downtown Athens (1991–2020), Extremes (1890–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n |

following Nafplion, which was the provisional capital from 1829. The municipality (City) of Athens is also the capital of the Attica region. The term *Athens* can refer either to the Municipality of Athens, to Greater Athens or urban area, or to the entire Athens Metropolitan Area.\n\n\nThe large **City Centre** (Greek: Κέντρο της Αθήνας) of the Greek capital falls directly within the **Municipality of Athens** or **Athens Municipality** (Greek: Δήμος Αθηναίων)—also **City of Athens**. Athens Municipality is the largest in population size in Greece. Piraeus also forms a significant city centre on its own[73] within the Athens Urban Area and it is the second largest in population size within it.\n\n\n\n### Athens Urban Area[edit]\n\n\nThe **Athens Urban Area** (Greek: Πολεοδομικό Συγκρότημα Αθηνών), also known as **Urban Area of the Capital** (Greek: Πολεοδομικό Συγκρότημα Πρωτεύουσας) or **Greater Athens** (Greek: Ευρύτερη Αθήνα),[74] today consists of 40 municipalities, 35 of which make up what was referred to as the former Athens Prefecture municipalities, located within 4 regional units (North Athens, West Athens, Central Athens, South Athens); and a further 5 municipalities, which make up the former Piraeus Prefecture municipalities, located within the regional unit of Piraeus as mentioned above.\n\n\nThe Athens Municipality forms the core and center of Greater Athens, which in its turn consists of the Athens Municipality and 40 more municipalities, divided in four regional units (Central, North, South and West Athens), accounting for 2,611,713 people (in 2021)[3] within an area of 361 km2 (139 sq mi).[19] Until 2010, which made up the abolished Athens Prefecture and the municipality of Piraeus, the historic Athenian port, with 4 other municipalities make up the regional unit of Piraeus. The regional units of Central Athens, North Athens, South Athens, West Athens and Piraeus with part of East[75] and West Attica[76] regional units combined make up the continuous Athens Urban Area,[76][77][78] also called the \"Urban Area of the Capital\" or simply \"Athens\" (the most common use of the term), spanning over 412 km2 (159 sq mi),[79] with a population of 4,200,764 people as of 2021. The Athens Urban Area is considered to form the city of Athens as a whole, despite its administrative divisions, which is the largest in Greece and the 9th most populated urban area in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Municipalities of the former Athens prefecture**\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Central Athens**: | 1.

For example, Kifissia and Glyfada serve as inter-municipal centres for northern and southern suburbs respectively.\n\n\n\n![](image)View of Vila Atlantis, in Kifissia, designed by Ernst Ziller\n![](image)Beach in the southern suburb of Alimos, one of the many beaches in the southern coast of Athens\nThe Athens Metropolitan Area consists of 58[81] densely populated municipalities, sprawling around the Municipality of Athens (the City Centre) in virtually all directions. For the Athenians, all the urban municipalities surrounding the City Centre are called suburbs. According to their geographic location in relation to the City of Athens, the suburbs are divided into four zones; the northern suburbs (including Agios Stefanos, Dionysos, Ekali, Nea Erythraia, Kifissia, Kryoneri, Maroussi, Pefki, Lykovrysi, Metamorfosi, Nea Ionia, Nea Filadelfeia, Irakleio, Vrilissia, Melissia, Penteli, Chalandri, Agia Paraskevi, Gerakas, Pallini, Galatsi, Psychiko and Filothei); the southern suburbs (including Alimos, Nea Smyrni, Moschato, Tavros, Agios Ioannis Renti, Kallithea, Piraeus, Agios Dimitrios, Palaio Faliro, Elliniko, Glyfada, Lagonisi, Saronida, Argyroupoli, Ilioupoli, Varkiza, Voula, Vari and Vouliagmeni); the eastern suburbs (including Zografou, Dafni, Vyronas, Kaisariani, Cholargos and Papagou); and the western suburbs (including Peristeri, Ilion, Egaleo, Koridallos, Agia Varvara, Keratsini, Perama, Nikaia, Drapetsona, Chaidari, Petroupoli, Agioi Anargyroi, Ano Liosia, Aspropyrgos, Eleusina, Acharnes and Kamatero).\n\n\nThe Athens city coastline, extending from the major commercial port of Piraeus to the southernmost suburb of Varkiza for some 25 km (20 mi),[82] is also connected to the City Centre by tram.\n\n\nIn the northern suburb of Maroussi, the upgraded main Olympic Complex (known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The area has been redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of Palaio Faliro, also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport – named Elliniko – in the southern suburbs, into one of the largest landscaped parks in Europe, to be named the Hellenikon Metropolitan Park.[83]\n\n\nMany of the southern suburbs (such as Alimos, Palaio Faliro, Elliniko, Glyfada, Voula, Vouliagmeni and Varkiza) known as the Athens Riviera, host a number of sandy beaches, most of which are operated by the Greek National Tourism Organisation and require an entrance fee. Casinos operate on both Mount Parnitha, some 25 km (16 mi)[84] from downtown Athens (accessible by car or cable car), and the nearby town of Loutraki (accessible by car via the Athens – Corinth National Highway, or the Athens Suburban Railway).\n\n\n\n![](image)\nCoastline of Palaio Faliro\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of twin towns and sister cities in Greece\n\nThe concept of a partner city is used under different names in different countries, but they mean the same thing, that two cities in different countries assist each other as partners. Athens has quite a number of partners, whether as a \"twin\", a \"sister\", or a \"partner.\"\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Athens population distribution\nThe Municipality of Athens has an official population of 643,452 people (in 2021).[3] According to the 2021 Population and Housing Census, The four regional units that make up what is referred to as Greater Athens have a combined population of 2,611,713 . They together with the regional unit of Piraeus (Greater Piraeus) make up the dense Athens Urban Area which reaches a total population of 3,059,764 inhabitants (in 2021).[3]\n\n\nThe municipality (Center) of Athens is the most populous in Greece, with a population of 643,452 people (in 2021)[3] and an area of 38.96 km2 (15.04 sq mi),[18] forming the core of the Athens Urban Area within the Attica Basin. The incumbent Mayor of Athens is Kostas Bakoyannis of New Democracy. The municipality is divided into seven municipal districts which are mainly used for administrative purposes.[85]\n\n\nFor the Athenians the most popular way of dividing the downtown is through its neighbourhoods such as Pagkrati, Ampelokipoi, Goudi, Exarcheia, Patisia, Ilisia, Petralona, Plaka, Anafiotika, Koukaki, Kolonaki and Kypseli, each with its own distinct history and characteristics.\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan Area[edit]\n\n\nThe Athens Metropolitan Area, with an area of 2,928.717 km2 (1,131 sq mi) and inhabited by 3,744,059 people in 2021,[3] consists of the Athens Urban Area with the addition of the towns and villages of East and West Attica, which surround the dense urban area of the Greek capital. It actually sprawls over the whole peninsula of Attica, which is the best part of the region of Attica, excluding the islands.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Classification of regional units within Greater Athens, Athens Urban Area and Athens Metropolitan Area\n |\n| --- |\n| Regional unit | Population (2021)[3] | Land Area (km2)\n | Area\n |\n| Central Athens | 1,002,212\n | 87.4\n | **Greater Athens**2,611,713364.2 km2\n | **Athens Urban Area**3,059,764414.6 km2\n | **Athens Metropolitan Area** 3,744,0592931.6 km2\n |\n| North Athens | 601,163\n | 140.7\n |\n| South Athens | 529,455\n | 69.4\n |\n| West Athens | 478,883\n | 66.7\n |\n| Piraeus | 448,051\n | 50.4\n | **Greater Piraeus**448,05150.4 km2\n |\n| East Attica | 518,755\n | 1,513\n |\n| West Attica | 165,540\n | 1,004\n |\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nAthens ranks in the lowest percentage for the risk on frequency and severity of terrorist attacks according to the EU Global Terrorism Database (EIU 2007–2016 calculations). The city also ranked 35th in Digital Security, 21st on Health Security, 29th on Infrastructure Security and 41st on Personal Security globally in a 2017 The Economist Intelligence Unit report.[86] It also ranks as a very safe city (39th globally out of 162 cities overall) on the ranking of the safest and most dangerous countries.[87] As May 2022 the crime index from Numbeo places Athens at 56.33 (moderate), while its safety index is at 43.68.Crime in Athens[88] According to a Mercer 2019 Quality of Living Survey, Athens ranks 89th on the Mercer Quality of Living Survey ranking.[89]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)OTE headquarters in Marousi, the largest technology company in Greece\n![](image)National Bank of Greece, the largest Greek bank by total assets[90][91]\n![](image)Ermou street, the main commercial street of Athens\nAthens is the financial capital of Greece. According to data from 2014, Athens as a metropolitan economic area produced US$130 billion as GDP in PPP, which consists of nearly half of the production for the whole country. Athens was ranked 102nd in that year's list of global economic metropolises, while GDP per capita for the same year was 32,000 US-dollars.[92]\n\n\nAthens is one of the major economic centres in south-eastern Europe and is considered a regional economic power. The port of Piraeus, where big investments by COSCO have already been delivered during the recent decade, the completion of the new Cargo Centre in Thriasion,[93] the expansion of the Athens Metro and the Athens Tram, as well as the Hellenikon metropolitan park redevelopment in Elliniko and other urban projects, are the economic landmarks of the upcoming years.\n\n\nProminent Greek companies such as Hellas Sat, Hellenic Aerospace Industry, Mytilineos Holdings, Titan Cement, Hellenic Petroleum, Papadopoulos E.J., Folli Follie, Jumbo S.A., OPAP, and Cosmote have their headquarters in the metropolitan area of Athens. Multinational companies such as Ericsson, Sony, Siemens, Motorola, Samsung, Microsoft, Teleperformance, Novartis, Mondelez and Coca-Cola also have their regional research and development headquarters in the city.\n\n\nThe banking sector is represented by National Bank of Greece, Alpha Bank, Eurobank, and Piraeus Bank, while the Bank of Greece is also situated in the City Centre. The Athens Stock Exchange was severely hit by the Greek government-debt crisis and the decision of the government to proceed into capital controls during summer 2015. As a whole the economy of Athens and Greece was strongly affected, while data showed a change from long recession to growth of 1.4% from 2017 onwards.[94]\n\n\nTourism is also a leading contributor to the economy of the city, as one of Europe's top destinations for city-break tourism, and also the gateway for excursions to both the islands and other parts of the mainland. Greece attracted 26.5 million visitors in 2015, 30.1 million visitors in 2017, and over 33 million in 2018, making Greece one of the most visited countries in Europe and the world, and contributing 18% to the country's GDP. Athens welcomed more than 5 million tourists in 2018, and 1.4 million were \"city-breakers\"; this was an increase by over a million city-breakers since 2013.[95]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nAthens has been a destination for travellers since antiquity. Over the past decade, the city's infrastructure and social amenities have improved, in part because of its successful bid to stage the 2004 Olympic Games. The Greek Government, aided by the EU, has funded major infrastructure projects such as the state-of-the-art Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport,[96] the expansion of the Athens Metro system,[52] and the new Attiki Odos Motorway.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama from Mount Lycabettus, with a view of the Panathinaiko Stadium, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the Hellenic Parliament and the Acropolis of Athens\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public transport in Athens\n\n![](image)Athens railways network (Metro, Suburban Railway and Tram)\nAthens is the country's major transportation hub. The city has Greece's largest airport and its largest port; Piraeus, too, is the largest container transport port in the Mediterranean, and the largest passenger port in Europe.\n\n\nAthens is a major national hub for Intercity (Ktel) and international buses, as well as for domestic and international rail transport. Public transport is serviced by a variety of transportation means, making up the country's largest mass transit system. Transport for Athens operates a large bus and trolleybus fleet, the city's Metro, a Suburban Railway service[97] and a tram network, connecting the southern suburbs to the city centre.[98]\n\n\n\n### Bus transport[edit]\n\n\nOSY (Greek: ΟΣΥ) (Odikes Sygkoinonies S.A.), a subsidiary company of OASA (Athens urban transport organisation), is the main operator of buses and trolleybuses in Athens. As of 2017, its network consists of around 322 bus lines, spanning the Athens Metropolitan Area, and making up a fleet of 2,375 buses and trolleybuses. Of those 2,375, 619 buses run on compressed natural gas, making up the largest fleet of natural gas-powered buses in Europe, and 354 are electric-powered (trolleybuses). All of the 354 trolleybuses are equipped to run on diesel in case of power failure.[99]\n\n\nInternational links are provided by a number of private companies. National and regional bus links are provided by KTEL from two InterCity Bus Terminals; Kifissos Bus Terminal A and Liosion Bus Terminal B, both located in the north-western part of the city. *Kifissos* provides connections towards Peloponnese, North Greece, West Greece and some Ionian Islands, whereas *Liosion* is used for most of Central Greece.\n\n\n\n### Railways[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Athens Metro, Proastiakos, and Athens Tram\n\nAthens is the hub of the country's national railway system (OSE), connecting the capital with major cities across Greece and abroad (Istanbul, Sofia, Belgrade and Bucharest).\n\n\n\n![](image)Suburban rail (Proastiakos)\nThe Athens Suburban Railway, referred to as the *Proastiakos*, connects Athens International Airport to the city of Kiato, 106 km (66 mi)[100] west of Athens, via Larissa station, the city's central rail station and the port of Piraeus. The length of Athens's commuter rail network extends to 120 km (75 mi),[100] and is expected to stretch to 281 km (175 mi) by 2010.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Athens Metro train (3rd generation stock)\nThe Athens Metro is operated by STASY S.A. (Greek: ΣΤΑΣΥ) (Statheres Sygkoinonies S.A.), a subsidiary company of OASA (Athens urban transport organisation), which provides public transport throughout the Athens Urban Area. While its main purpose is transport, it also houses Greek artifacts found during the construction of the system.[101] The Athens Metro runs three metro lines, namely Line 1 (Green Line), Line 2 (Red Line) and Line 3 (Blue Line) lines, of which the first was constructed in 1869, and the other two largely during the 1990s, with the initial new sections opened in January 2000. Line 1 mostly runs at ground level and the other two (Line 2 & 3) routes run entirely underground. A fleet of 42 trains, using 252 carriages, operates on the network,[102] with a daily occupancy of 1,353,000 passengers.[103]\n\n\n*Line 1* (Green Line) serves 24 stations, and is the oldest line of the Athens metro network. It runs from Piraeus station to Kifissia station and covers a distance of 25.6 km (15.9 mi). There are transfer connections with the Blue Line 3 at Monastiraki station and with the Red Line 2 at Omonia and Attiki stations. *Line 2* (Red Line) runs from Anthoupoli station to Elliniko station and covers a distance of 17.5 km (10.9 mi).[102] The line connects the western suburbs of Athens with the southeast suburbs, passing through the center of Athens. The Red Line has transfer connections with the Green Line 1 at Attiki and Omonia stations. There are also transfer connections with the Blue Line 3 at Syntagma station and with the tram at Syntagma, Syngrou Fix and Neos Kosmos stations. *Line 3* (Blue Line) runs from Dimotiko Theatro station, through the central Monastiraki and Syntagma stations to Doukissis Plakentias avenue in the northeastern suburb of Halandri.[102] It then ascends to ground level and continues to Athens International Airport Eleftherios Venizelos using the suburban railway infrastructure, extending its total length to 39 km (24 mi).[102] The spring 2007 extension from Monastiraki westwards to Egaleo connected some of the main night life hubs of the city, namely those of Gazi (Kerameikos station) with Psirri (Monastiraki station) and the city centre (Syntagma station).The new stations Maniatika, Piraeus and Dimotiko Theatro, were completed in October 10, 2022,[104][105] connecting the biggest port of Greece, the Port of Piraeus, with Athens International Airport, the biggest airport of Greece.\n\n\n\n![](image)Vehicle of the Athens Tram\nThe Athens Tram is operated by STASY S.A. (Statheres Sygkoinonies S.A.), a subsidiary company of Transport for Athens (OASA). It has a fleet of 35 Sirio type vehicles[106] and 25 Alstom Citadis type vehicles[107] which serve 48 stations,[106] employ 345 people with an average daily occupancy of 65,000 passengers.[106] The tram network spans a total length of 27 km (17 mi) and covers ten Athenian suburbs.[106] The network runs from Syntagma Square to the southwestern suburb of Palaio Faliro, where the line splits in two branches; the first runs along the Athens coastline toward the southern suburb of Voula, while the other heads toward Neo Faliro. The network covers the majority of the Athens coastline.[108] Further extension is under construction towards the major commercial port of Piraeus.[106] The expansion to Piraeus will include 12 new stations, increase the overall length of tram route by 5.4 km (3 mi), and increase the overall transportation network.[109]\n\n\n\n### Athens International Airport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Athens International Airport\n\n![](image)Athens International Airport\nAthens is served by the Athens International Airport (ATH), located near the town of Spata, in the eastern Messoghia plain, some 35 km (22 mi) east of center of Athens.[110] The airport, awarded the \"European Airport of the Year 2004\" Award,[111] is intended as an expandable hub for air travel in southeastern Europe and was constructed in 51 months, costing 2.2 billion euros. It employs a staff of 14,000.[111]\n\n\n\n### Ferry[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of Piraeus is the largest port in Greece and one of the largest in Europe. Rafina and Lavrio act as alternative ports of Athens, connects the city with numerous Greek islands of the Aegean Sea, Evia and Çeşme in Turkey,[112][113] while also serving the cruise ships that arrive.\n\n\n\n### Motorways[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: National Roads and Motorways in Greece\n\n![](image)Aerial view of an A6 interchange north of Athens\nTwo main motorways of Greece begin in Athens, namely the A1/E75, heading north towards Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki; and the border crossing of Evzones and the A8/E94 heading west, towards Greece's third largest city, Patras, which incorporated the GR-8A. Before their completion much of the road traffic used the GR-1 and the GR-8.\n\n\nAthens' Metropolitan Area is served by the motorway network of the Attiki Odos toll-motorway (code: A6). Its main section extends from the western industrial suburb of Elefsina to Athens International Airport; while two beltways, namely the Aigaleo Beltway (A65) and the Hymettus Beltway (A64) serve parts of western and eastern Athens respectively. The span of the Attiki Odos in all its length is 65 km (40 mi),[114] making it the largest metropolitan motorway network in all of Greece.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Facade of the Academy of Athens\n![](image)University of Athens\n![](image)The National Library of Greece.\nLocated on Panepistimiou Street, the old campus of the University of Athens, the National Library, and the Athens Academy form the \"Athens Trilogy\" built in the mid-19th century. The largest and oldest university in Athens is the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Most of the functions of NKUA have been transferred to a campus in the eastern suburb of Zografou. The National Technical University of Athens is located on Patision Street.\n\n\nThe University of West Attica is the second largest university in Athens. The seat of the university is located in the western area of Athens, where the philosophers of Ancient Athens delivered lectures. All the activities of UNIWA are carried out in the modern infrastructure of the three University Campuses within the metropolitan region of Athens (Egaleo Park, Ancient Olive Groove and Athens), which offer modern teaching and research spaces, entertainment and support facilities for all students. Other universities that lie within Athens are the Athens University of Economics and Business, the Panteion University, the Agricultural University of Athens and the University of Piraeus.\n\n\nThere are overall ten state-supported Institutions of Higher (or Tertiary) education located in the Athens Urban Area, these are by chronological order: Athens School of Fine Arts (1837), National Technical University of Athens (1837), National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (1837), Agricultural University of Athens (1920), Athens University of Economics and Business (1920), Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences (1927), University of Piraeus (1938), Harokopio University of Athens (1990), School of Pedagogical and Technological Education (2002), University of West Attica (2018). There are also several other private *colleges*, as they called formally in Greece, as the establishment of private universities is prohibited by the constitution. Many of them are accredited by a foreign state or university such as the American College of Greece and the Athens Campus of the University of Indianapolis.[115]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Greece\n\n### Archaeological hub and museums[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of museums in Greece\n\n![](image)The National Archaeological Museum in central Athens\n![](image)The Acropolis Museum\n![](image)Museum of the Ancient Agora in the Stoa of Attalos\nThe city is a world centre of archaeological research. Alongside national academic institutions, such as the Athens University and the Archaeological Society, it is home to multiple archaeological museums, taking in the National Archaeological Museum, the Cycladic Museum, the Epigraphic Museum, the Byzantine & Christian Museum, as well as museums at the ancient Agora, Acropolis, Kerameikos, and the Kerameikos Archaeological Museum. The city is also the setting for the Demokritos laboratory for Archaeometry, alongside regional and national archaeological authorities forming part of the Greek Department of Culture.\n\n\nAthens hosts 17 Foreign Archaeological Institutes which promote and facilitate research by scholars from their home countries. As a result, Athens has more than a dozen archaeological libraries and three specialized archaeological laboratories, and is the venue of several hundred specialized lectures, conferences and seminars, as well as dozens of archaeological exhibitions each year. At any given time, hundreds of international scholars and researchers in all disciplines of archaeology are to be found in the city.\n\n\nAthens' most important museums include:\n\n\n\n* the National Archaeological Museum, the largest archaeological museum in the country, and one of the most important internationally, as it contains a vast collection of antiquities. Its artefacts cover a period of more than 5,000 years, from late Neolithic Age to Roman Greece;\n* the Benaki Museum with its several branches for each of its collections including ancient, Byzantine, Ottoman-era, Chinese art and beyond;\n* the Byzantine and Christian Museum, one of the most important museums of Byzantine art;\n* the National Art Gallery, the nation's eponymous leading gallery, which reopened in 2021 after renovation;\n* the National Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in 2000 in a former brewery building;\n* the Numismatic Museum, housing a major collection of ancient and modern coins;\n* the Museum of Cycladic Art, home to an extensive collection of Cycladic art, including its famous figurines of white marble;\n* the New Acropolis Museum, opened in 2009, and replacing the old museum on the Acropolis. The new museum has proved considerably popular; almost one million people visited during the summer period June–October 2009 alone. A number of smaller and privately owned museums focused on Greek culture and arts are also to be found.\n* the Kerameikos Archaeological Museum, a museum which displays artifacts from the burial site of Kerameikos. Much of the pottery and other artifacts relate to Athenian attitudes towards death and the afterlife, throughout many ages.\n* the Jewish Museum of Greece, a museum which describes the history and culture of the Greek Jewish community.\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Modern architecture in Athens\n\n![](image)The Zappeion Hall\n![](image)The Cathedral of Athens (Athens Metropolis)\nAthens incorporates architectural styles ranging from Greco-Roman and Neoclassical to Modern. They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict height restriction laws in order to ensure the Acropolis Hill is visible throughout the city. Despite the variety in styles, there is evidence of continuity in elements of the architectural environment throughout the city's history.[116]\n\n\nFor the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as Eclecticism, especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the Old Royal Palace was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, Theophil Freiherr von Hansen and Ernst Ziller took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the Athens Academy and the Zappeion Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as Schliemann's Iliou Melathron.\n\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, modern architecture including Bauhaus and Art Deco began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include Kolonaki, and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include Kypseli.[117]\n\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s during the extension and development of Athens, other modern movements such as the International style played an important role. The centre of Athens was largely rebuilt, leading to the demolition of a number of neoclassical buildings. The architects of this era employed materials such as glass, marble and aluminium, and many blended modern and classical elements.[118] After World War II, internationally known architects to have designed and built in the city included Walter Gropius, with his design for the US Embassy, and, among others, Eero Saarinen, in his postwar design for the east terminal of the Ellinikon Airport.\n\n\n\n### Urban sculpture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Old Parliament House, now home to the National History Museum. View from Stadiou Street.\nAcross the city numerous statues or busts are to be found. Apart from the neoclassicals by Leonidas Drosis at the Academy of Athens (Plato, Socrates, Apollo and Athena), others in notable categories include the statue of Theseus by Georgios Fytalis at Thiseion; depictions of philhellenes such as Lord Byron, George Canning, and William Gladstone; the equestrian statue of Theodoros Kolokotronis by Lazaros Sochos in front of the Old Parliament; statues of Ioannis Kapodistrias, Rigas Feraios and Adamantios Korais at the University; of Evangelos Zappas and Konstantinos Zappas at the Zappeion; Ioannis Varvakis at the National Garden; the\" Woodbreaker\" by Dimitrios Filippotis; the equestrian statue of Alexandros Papagos in the Papagou district; and various busts of fighters of Greek independence at the Pedion tou Areos. A significant landmark is also the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Syntagma.\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Theatre of Greece, near Omonoia Square\nAthens is home to 148 theatrical stages, more than any other city in the world, including the ancient Odeon of Herodes Atticus, home to the Athens Festival, which runs from May to October each year.[119][120] In addition to a large number of multiplexes, Athens plays host to open air garden cinemas. The city also supports music venues, including the Athens Concert Hall (*Megaro Moussikis*), which attracts world class artists.[121] The Athens Planetarium,[122] located in Andrea Syngrou Avenue, in Palaio Faliro[123] is one of the largest and best equipped digital planetaria in the world.[124] The Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, inaugurated in 2016, will house the National Library of Greece and the Greek National Opera.[125] In 2018 Athens was designated as the World Book Capital by UNESCO.[126]\n\n\nRestaurants, tavernas and bars can be found in the entertainment hubs in Plaka and the Trigono areas of the historic centre, the inner suburbs of Gazi and Psyrri are especially busy with nightclubs and bars, while Kolonaki, Exarchia, Metaxourgeio, Koukaki and Pangrati offer more of a cafe and restaurant scene. The coastal suburbs of Microlimano, Alimos and Glyfada include many tavernas, beach bars and busy summer clubs.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Centre, home of the Greek National Opera and the new National Library\nThe most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the Athenian serenades (Αθηναϊκές καντάδες), based on the Heptanesean kantádhes (καντάδες 'serenades'; sing.: καντάδα) and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια 'theatrical revue songs') in revues, musical comedies, operettas and nocturnes that were dominating Athens' theatre scene.\n\n\nIn 1922, following the war, genocide and later population exchange suffered by the Greek population of Asia Minor, many ethnic Greeks fled to Athens. They settled in poor neighbourhoods and brought with them Rebetiko music, making it also popular in Greece, and which later became the base for the Laïko music. Other forms of song popular today in Greece are elafrolaika, entechno, dimotika, and skyladika.[127] Greece's most notable, and internationally famous, composers of Greek song, mainly of the entechno form, are Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis. Both composers have achieved fame abroad for their composition of film scores.[127]\n\n\nThe renowned American-born Greek soprano Maria Callas spent her teenage years in Athens, where she settled in 1937.[128][129] Her professional opera career started in 1940 in Athens, with the Greek National Opera.[130] In 2018, the city's municipal Olympia Theatre was renamed to \"Olympia City Music Theatre 'Maria Callas'\"[131][132] and in 2023, the Municipality inaugurated the Maria Callas Museum, housing it in a neoclassical building on 44 Mitropoleos street.[133]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of sports clubs in Athens Municipality\n\n![](image)The Panathenaic Stadium of Athens (Kallimarmaron) dates back to the fourth century BC and has hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.\nFile:Aerial view of Olympic complex in Athens 2004 DSC06793.jpgAthens Olympic Sports Complex\nFile:GIPEDO AEK-1.jpgAgia Sophia Stadium\nAthens has a long tradition in sports and sporting events, serving as home to the most important clubs in Greek sport and housing a large number of sports facilities. The city has also been host to sports events of international importance.\n\n\nAthens has hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, in 1896 and 2004. The 2004 Summer Olympics required the development of the Athens Olympic Stadium, which has since gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world, and one of its most interesting modern monuments.[134] The biggest stadium in the country, it hosted two finals of the UEFA Champions League, in 1994 and 2007. Athens' other major stadiums are the Karaiskakis Stadium located in Piraeus, a sports and entertainment complex, host of the 1971 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, and Agia Sophia Stadium located in Nea Filadelfeia.\n\n\nAthens has hosted the EuroLeague final three times, the first in 1985 and second in 1993, both at the Peace and Friendship Stadium, most known as SEF, a large indoor arena,[135] and the third time in 2007 at the Olympic Indoor Hall. Events in other sports such as athletics, volleyball, water polo etc., have been hosted in the capital's venues.\n\n\nAthens is home to three European multi-sport clubs: Panathinaikos, originated in Athens city centre, Olympiacos, originated in the suburb of Piraeus and AEK Athens, originated in the suburb of Nea Filadelfeia. In football, Panathinaikos made it to the 1971 European Cup Final, Olympiacos have dominated domestic competitions, while AEK Athens is the other member of the big three. These clubs also have basketball teams; Panathinaikos and Olympiacos are among the top powers in European basketball, having won the Euroleague six times and three respectively, whilst AEK Athens was the first Greek team to win a European trophy in any team sport.\n\n\nOther notable clubs within Athens are Athinaikos, Panionios, Atromitos, Apollon, Panellinios, Egaleo F.C., Ethnikos Piraeus, Maroussi BC and Peristeri B.C. Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports.\n\n\nThe Athens area encompasses a variety of terrain, notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a mountain range. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of kilometres of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on foot and bike.\n\n\nBeyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include skiing, rock climbing, hang gliding and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the Sierra Club, which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.\n\n\nAthens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in Lausanne, Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics, to Atlanta, United States.[21] It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.[21] Prior to this round, the cities of Buenos Aires, Stockholm and Cape Town had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.[21] Although the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5 billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern urban development.[136] The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from all 202 countries.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Athens\n* Timeline of Athens\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Athens: City of Wisdom\".

The broader Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing Gyeonggi province and Incheon metropolitan city, emerged as the world's fourth largest metropolitan economy in 2014, trailing only Tokyo, New York City, and Los Angeles, hosting more than half of South Korea's population. Although Seoul's population peaked at slightly over 10 million, it has gradually decreased since 2014, standing at approximately 9.97 million residents as of 2020. Seoul is the seat of the Korean government.\n\n\nSeoul's history traces back to 18 BC when it was founded by the people of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. During the Joseon dynasty, Seoul was officially designated as the capital, surrounded by the Fortress Wall of Seoul. In the early 20th century, Seoul was occupied by the Japanese Empire, temporarily renamed \"Gyeongseong.\" The Korean War brought fierce battles, with Seoul changing hands four times and leaving the city mostly in ruins. Nevertheless, the city has since undergone significant reconstruction and rapid urbanization.\n\n\nSeoul was rated Asia's most livable city, with the second-highest quality of life globally according to Arcadis in 2015 and a GDP per capita (PPP) of approximately $40,000. 15 *Fortune* Global 500 companies, including industry giants such as Samsung,[9] LG, and Hyundai, are headquartered in the Seoul Capital Area, which has major technology hubs, such as Gangnam and Digital Media City,[10]. Seoul is ranked seventh in the Global Power City Index and the Global Financial Centres Index, and is one of the five leading hosts of global conferences.[11] The city has also hosted major events such as the 1986 Asian Games, the 1988 Summer Olympics, and the 2010 G20 Seoul summit.\n\n\nSeoul is geographically set in a mountainous and hilly terrain, with Bukhan Mountain positioned on its northern edge. Within the Seoul Capital Area lie five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong, and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty.[12] Furthermore, Seoul has witnessed a surge in modern architectural development, with iconic landmarks including the N Seoul Tower, the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, the Trade Tower, COEX, IFC Seoul, and Parc1. Seoul was named the World Design Capital in 2010 and has served as the national hub for the music, entertainment, and cultural industries that have propelled K-pop and the Korean Wave to international prominence.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Seoul\n\nThe city has been known in the past by the names Wiryeseong (위례성; 慰禮城, during the Baekje era), Bukhansangun (북한산군; 北漢山郡 during the Goguryeo era), Namcheon (남천; 南川,[13] during the Silla era), Hanyang (한양; 漢陽, during the Northern and Southern States period), Namgyeong(남경; 南京, during Goryeo era), Hanseong (한성; 漢城, during the Joseon era), and Keijō (京城) or Gyeongseong (경성; 京城) during Japanese rule.[14]\n\n\nDuring Japan's annexation of Korea, *Hanseong* (漢城) was renamed *Keijō* (京城) by the Imperial authorities to prevent confusion with the Hanja '漢' (a transliteration of an ancient Korean word *Han* (한) meaning \"great\"), which also refers to Han people or the Han dynasty in Chinese and in Japanese is a term for \"China\".[15]\n\n\nAfter World War II and the liberation of Korea, the city took its present name, which originated from the Korean word meaning \"capital city\", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, *Seorabeol* (서라벌; 徐羅伐), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.[16] Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name *Geumseong* (金城, literally \"Gold Castle or City\" or \"Metal Castle or City\"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name *Seorabeol* had the same meaning as *Geumseong*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding Hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). On 18 January 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic *Hancheng* (simplified Chinese: 汉城; traditional Chinese: 漢城; pinyin: *Hànchéng*) to *Shou'er* (首尔; 首爾; *Shǒu'ěr*).[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Seoul\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Seoul.\n![](image)The Fortress Wall of Seoul\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSettlement of the Han River area, where present-day Seoul is located, began around 4000 BC.[19]\n\n\nSeoul is first recorded as Wiryeseong, the capital of Baekje (founded in 18 BC) in the northeastern area of modern Seoul.[19] There are several city walls remaining in the area that date from this time. Pungnaptoseong, an earthen wall located southeast Seoul, is widely believed to have been at the main Wiryeseong site.[20] As the Three Kingdoms competed for this strategic region, control passed from Baekje to Goguryeo in the 5th century.[21]\n\n\nHowever, according to Samguk Sagi, both Baekje and Silla described the land as frontier border of Baekje, not as the capital region.[22][23] Moreover, Jinheung Taewang Stele found at current day Bukhansan tells that the place was underdeveloped as of 6th century AD,[13] suggesting that the first capital Wiryeseong was not located in or nearby Seoul.\n\n\nIn July or August 553, Silla took the control of the region from Baekje, and the city became a part of newly established Sin Province (신주; 新州).[22][23] Sin (新) has both meaning of \"New\" and \"Silla\", thus literally means New Silla Province.\n\n\nIn November 555, Jinheung Taewang made royal visit to Bukhansan, and inspected the borderline.[24] In 557, Silla abolished Sin Province, and established Bukhansan Province (북한산주; 北漢山州).[25] The word Hanseong (한성; 漢城; lit. Han Fortress) appears on the stone wall of \"Pyongyang Fortress\", which was presumably built in the mid to late 6th century AD over period of 42 years, located in Pyongyang, while there is no evidence that Seoul had name Hanseong dating the three kingdoms and earlier period.[26][27][28][29][30]\n\n\nIn 568, Jinheung Taewang made another royal visit to the northern border, visited Hanseong, and stayed in Namcheon on his way back to the capital. During his stay, he set Jinheung Taewang Stele, abolished Bukhansan Province, and established Namcheon Province (남천주; 南川州; South River Province), appointing the city as the provincial capital.[13][31] Based on the naming system, the actual name of Han River during this time was likely Namcheon (Nam River) itself or should have the word ending with \"cheon\" (천; 川) not \"gang\" (강; 江) nor \"su\" (수; 水). In addition, \"Bukhansan\" Jinheung Stele clearly states that Silla had possession of Hanseong (modern day Pyongyang), thus Bukhansan has to be located north of Hanseong. Modern day Pyongyang was not Pyongyang, Taedong River was likely Han River, and Bukhansan was not Bukhansan during the three kingdoms period.[13][32] Moreover, Pyongyang was a common noun meaning capital used by Goguryeo and Goryeo dynasties, similar to Seoul.[33]\n\n\nIn 603, Goguryeo attacked Bukhansanseong (북한산성; 北漢山城; Bukhan Mountain Fortress), which Silla ended up winning.[34][35] In 604, Silla abolished Namcheon Province, and reestablished Bukhansan Province in order to strengthen the northern border. The city lost its provincial capital position and was put under Bukhansan Province once again.[36] This further proves that Bukhansan was located in the North of modern-day Pyongyang as changing the provincial name and objective would not be required if Bukhansan was located within Seoul.\n\n\nIn the 11th century Goryeo, which succeeded Unified Silla, built a summer palace in Seoul, which was referred to as the \"Southern Capital\". It was only from this period that Seoul became a larger settlement.[19]\n\n\n\n### Joseon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Seoul created 1825–1835 by Kim Jeong-ho and designated National Treasure no 853.\nWhen Joseon replaced Goryeo, the capital was moved to Seoul (also known as Hanyang or Hanseong), where it remained until the fall of the dynasty. The Gyeongbok Palace, built in the 14th century, served as the royal residence until 1592. The other large palace, Changdeokgung, constructed in 1405, served as the main royal palace from 1611 to 1872.[19] After Joseon changed its name to the Korean Empire in 1897, Hwangseong also designated Seoul.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nOriginally, the city was entirely surrounded by a massive circular stone wall to provide its citizens security from wild animals, thieves and attacks. The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (except along Bugaksan Mountain (북악산; 北岳山), north of the downtown area[37]), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun).[38] During the Joseon dynasty, the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the Bosingak belfry.[39] In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to introduce electricity in the royal palace, built by the Edison Illuminating Company[40] and a decade later Seoul also implemented electrical street lights.[41]\n\n\nMuch of the development was due to trade with foreign countries like France and the United States. For example, the Seoul Electric Company, Seoul Electric Trolley Company, and Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company were all joint Korean–U.S. owned enterprises.[42] In 1904, an American by the name of Angus Hamilton visited the city and said, \"The streets of Seoul are magnificent, spacious, clean, admirably made and well-drained. The narrow, dirty lanes have been widened, gutters have been covered, roadways broadened. Seoul is within measurable distance of becoming the highest, most interesting and cleanest city in the East.\"[43]\n\n\n\n### Japanese annexation of Korea[edit]\n\n\nAfter the annexation treaty in 1910, Japan annexed Korea and renamed the city Gyeongseong (\"Kyongsong\" in Korean and \"Keijo\" in Japanese). Japanese technology was imported, the city walls were removed, some of the gates demolished. Roads became paved and Western-style buildings were constructed. The city was liberated by U.S. forces at the end of World War II.[19]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\nIn 1945, the city was officially named Seoul, and was designated as a special city in 1949.[19]\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Seoul changed hands between the Soviet/Chinese-backed North Korean forces and the American-backed South Korean forces four times: falling to the North Koreans in the June 1950 First Battle of Seoul, recaptured by UN forces in the September 1950 Second Battle of Seoul, falling to a combined Chinese/North Korean force in the January 1951 Third Battle of Seoul, and finally being recaptured once more by UN forces in Operation Ripper during the spring of 1951.[44][45] The extensive fighting left the city heavily damaged after the war. The capital was temporarily relocated to Busan.[19] One estimate of the extensive damage states that after the war, at least 191,000 buildings, 55,000 houses, and 1,000 factories lay in ruins. In addition, a flood of refugees had entered Seoul during the war, swelling the population of the city and its metropolitan area to an estimated 1.5 million by 1955.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the war, Seoul began to focus on reconstruction and modernization. As South Korea's economy started to grow rapidly from the 1960s, urbanization also accelerated and workers began to move to Seoul and other larger cities.[46] From the 1970s, the size of Seoul administrative area greatly expanded as it annexed a number of towns and villages from several surrounding counties.[47]\n\n\nUntil 1972, Seoul was claimed by North Korea as its *de jure* capital, being specified as such in Article 103 of the 1948 North Korean constitution.[48]\n\n\nSouth Korea's 2019 population was estimated at 51.71 million, and according to the 2018 Population and Housing Census, 49.8% of the population resided in the Seoul metropolitan area. This was up by 0.7% from 49.1% in 2010, showing a distinct trend toward the concentration of the population in the capital.[49] Seoul has become the economic, political and cultural hub of the country,[19] with several Fortune Global 500 companies, including Samsung, SK Holdings, Hyundai, POSCO and LG Group headquartered there.[50]\n\n\nSeoul was the host city of the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Summer Olympics as well as one of the venues of the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\nVarious views of Seoul from the 63 Building in July, 2019\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Han River at sunrise\nSeoul is in the northwest of South Korea. Seoul proper comprises 605.25 km2 (233.69 sq mi),[3] with a radius of approximately 15 km (9 mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Seoul\n\n\n\n|  Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 17\n\n\n\n2\n\n−6\n | 28\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 37\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 73\n\n\n\n18\n\n8\n | 104\n\n\n\n24\n\n14\n | 130\n\n\n\n28\n\n19\n | 414\n\n\n\n29\n\n22\n | 348\n\n\n\n30\n\n23\n | 142\n\n\n\n26\n\n18\n | 52\n\n\n\n20\n\n11\n | 51\n\n\n\n12\n\n4\n | 23\n\n\n\n4\n\n−3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 0.7\n\n\n\n36\n\n22\n | 1.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n52\n\n35\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n64\n\n46\n | 4.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n56\n | 5.1\n\n\n\n82\n\n66\n | 16\n\n\n\n84\n\n72\n | 14\n\n\n\n86\n\n73\n | 5.6\n\n\n\n79\n\n64\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n68\n\n51\n | 2\n\n\n\n53\n\n38\n | 0.9\n\n\n\n40\n\n26\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nSeoul has a humid continental (Köppen: *Dwa*) or humid subtropical climate (*Cwa*, by −3 °C or 26.6 °F isotherm), influenced by the monsoons; there is great variation in temperature and precipitation throughout the year.[51][52] The suburbs of Seoul are generally cooler than the center of Seoul because of the urban heat island effect.[53] Summers are hot and humid, with the East Asian monsoon taking place from June until September. August, the hottest month, has average high and low temperatures of 30.0 and 22.9 °C (86 and 73 °F) with higher temperatures possible. Heat index values can surpass 40 °C (104.0 °F) at the height of summer. \nWinters are usually cold to freezing with average January high and low temperatures of 2.1 and −5.5 °C (35.8 and 22.1 °F), and are generally much drier than summers, with an average of 24.9 days of snow annually. Sometimes, temperatures drop dramatically to below −10 °C (14 °F), and on some occasions as low as −15 °C (5 °F) in the mid winter period of January and February. Temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F) have been recorded.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Seoul (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1907–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 14.4(57.9)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 38.4(101.1)\n | 39.6(103.3)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 30.1(86.2)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 39.6(103.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 27.6(81.7)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 26.2(79.2)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −2.0(28.4)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −5.5(22.1)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | −3.4(25.9)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −22.5(−8.5)\n | −19.6(−3.3)\n | −14.1(6.6)\n | −4.3(24.3)\n | 2.4(36.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | −5.1(22.8)\n | −11.9(10.6)\n | −23.1(−9.6)\n | −23.1(−9.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 16.8(0.66)\n | 28.2(1.11)\n | 36.9(1.45)\n | 72.9(2.87)\n | 103.6(4.08)\n | 129.5(5.10)\n | 414.4(16.31)\n | 348.2(13.71)\n | 141.5(5.57)\n | 52.2(2.06)\n | 51.1(2.01)\n | 22.6(0.89)\n | 1,417.9(55.82)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 6.1\n | 5.8\n | 7.0\n | 8.4\n | 8.6\n | 9.9\n | 16.3\n | 14.7\n | 9.1\n | 6.1\n | 8.8\n | 7.8\n | 108.6\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 7.1\n | 5.1\n | 2.8\n | 0.2\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 2.3\n | 6.4\n | 23.9\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 56.2\n | 54.6\n | 54.6\n | 54.8\n | 59.7\n | 65.7\n | 76.2\n | 73.5\n | 66.4\n | 61.8\n | 60.4\n | 57.8\n | 61.8\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 169.6\n | 170.8\n | 198.2\n | 206.3\n | 223.0\n | 189.1\n | 123.6\n | 156.1\n | 179.7\n | 206.5\n | 157.3\n | 162.9\n | 2,143.1\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 52.3\n | 53.6\n | 51.0\n | 51.9\n | 48.4\n | 41.2\n | 26.8\n | 36.2\n | 47.2\n | 57.1\n | 50.2\n | 51.1\n | 46.4\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[54][55][56] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[57] Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[58] |\n\n### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Air pollution in South Korea\n\n![](image)Very Unhealthy\n Unhealthy\n Unhealthy for sensitive groups\nModerate\n Good\nAccording to the Environmental Performance Index 2016, South Korea ranked 173rd out of 180 countries in terms of air quality. More than 50 percent of the populations in South Korea are exposed to dangerous levels of fine dust.[59][60]\nAir pollution is a major issue in Seoul.[61][62][63][64] According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database,[65] the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2014 was 24 micrograms per cubic meter (1.0×10−5 gr/cu ft), which is 2.4 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines[66] for the annual mean PM2.5. The Seoul Metropolitan Government monitors and publicly shares real-time air quality data.[67]\n\n\nSince the early 1960s, the Ministry of Environment has implemented a range of policies and air pollutant standards to improve and manage air quality for its people.[68] The \"Special Act on the Improvement of Air Quality in the Seoul Metropolitan Area\" was passed in December 2003. Its 1st Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2005–2014) focused on improving the concentrations of PM10 and nitrogen dioxide by reducing emissions.[69] As a result, the annual average PM10 concentrations decreased from 70.0 μg/m3 in 2001 to 44.4 μg/m3 in 2011[70] and 46 μg/m3 in 2014.[65] As of 2014, the annual average PM10 concentration was still at least twice than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines.[66] The 2nd Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2015–2024) added PM2.5 and ozone to its list of managed pollutants.[71]\n\n\nAsian dust, emissions from Seoul and in general from the rest of South Korea, as well as emissions from China, all contribute to Seoul's air quality.[62][72] A partnership between researchers in South Korea and the United States is conducting an international air quality field study in Korea (KORUS-AQ) to determine how much each source contributes.[73][*needs update*]\n\n\nBesides air quality, greenhouse gas emissions represent hot issues in South Korea since the country is among top-10 strongest emitters in the world. Seoul is the strongest hotspot of greenhouse gas emissions in the country and according to satellite data, the persistent carbon dioxide anomaly over the city is one of the strongest in the world.[74]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)Seoul City Hall\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Government is the local government for Seoul, and is responsible for the administration and provision of various services to the city, including correctional institutions, education, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. It is headed by a mayor and three vice mayors, and is divided into 25 autonomous districts and 522 administrative neighborhoods.[75][76]\n\n\n\n## Administrative districts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Seoul\n\n![](image)Districts of Seoul\nSeoul is divided into 25 gu (구; 區) (district).[77] The *gu* vary greatly in area (from 10 to 47 km2 or 3.9 to 18.1 sq mi) and population (from fewer than 140,000 to 630,000). Songpa has the most people, while Seocho has the largest area. The government of each gu handles many of the functions that are handled by city governments in other jurisdictions. Each *gu* is divided into \"*dong*\" (동; 洞) or neighborhoods. Some gu have only a few dong while others like Jongno District have a very large number of distinct neighborhoods. Gu of Seoul consist of 423 administrative dongs (행정동) in total.[77] *Dong* are also sub-divided into 13,787 *tong* (통; 統), which are further divided into 102,796 *ban* in total.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul population pyramid in 2022\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 1,021,000 | —     |\n| 1960 | 2,361,000 | +8.74% |\n| 1970 | 5,312,000 | +8.45% |\n| 1980 | 8,244,000 | +4.49% |\n| 1990 | 10,518,000 | +2.47% |\n| 2000 | 9,879,000 | −0.62% |\n| 2010 | 9,796,000 | −0.08% |\n| 2020 | 9,963,000 | +0.17% |\n| source:[78] |\n\n\nSeoul proper is noted for its population density, which is almost twice that of New York City and eight times greater than Rome. Its metropolitan area was the most densely populated among OECD countries in Asia in 2012, and second worldwide after that of Paris.[79] As of 2015, the population was 9.86 million,[80] in 2012, it was 10.44 million. As of 2021, the population is 9.59 million.[81][82] As of the end of June 2011, 10.29 million Republic of Korea citizens lived in the city. This was a 0.24% decrease from the end of 2010. The population of Seoul has been dropping since the early 1990s, the reasons being the high costs of living, urban sprawling to Gyeonggi region's satellite bed cities and an aging population.[80]\n\n\nAs of 2016, the number of foreigners living in Seoul was 404,037, 22.9% of the total foreign population in South Korea.[83] As of June 2011, 186,631 foreigners were Chinese citizens of Korean ancestry. This was an 8.84% increase from the end of 2010 and a 12.85% increase from June 2010. The next largest group was Chinese citizens who are not of Korean ethnicity; 29,901 of them resided in Seoul. The next highest group consisted of the 9,999 United States citizens who were not of Korean ancestry. The next highest group were Taiwanese citizens, at 8,717.[84]\n\n\nThe two major religions in Seoul are Christianity and Buddhism. Other religions include Muism (indigenous religion) and Confucianism. Seoul is home to one of the world's largest Christian congregations, Yoido Full Gospel Church, which has around 830,000 members.[85] According to the 2015 census, 10.8% of the population follows Buddhism and 35% follows Christianity (24.3% Protestantism and 10.7% Catholicism). 53.6% of the population is irreligious.[86]\n\n\n\nReligion in Seoul (2015)[86]\n\n\n\nNot religious (53.6%)\nProtestantism (24.3%)\nBuddhism (10.8%)\nCatholicism (10.7%)\nOther (0.6%)\n\nSeoul is home to the world's largest modern university founded by a Buddhist Order, Dongguk University.[87] Native Seoulites tend to speak the Gyeonggi dialect of Korean.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of South Korea\n\n![](image)Gangnam Commercial Area\nSeoul is the business and financial hub of South Korea. Although it accounts for only 0.6 percent of the nation's land area, 48.3 percent of South Korea's bank deposits were held in Seoul in 2003,[88] and the city generated 23 percent of the country's GDP overall in 2012.[89] In 2008 the Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index ranked Seoul No.9.[90] The Global Financial Centres Index in 2015 listed Seoul as the 6th financially most competitive city in the world.[91] The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Seoul 15th in the list of \"Overall 2025 City Competitiveness\" regarding future competitiveness of cities.[92]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nThe traditional, labor-intensive manufacturing industries have been continuously replaced by information technology, electronics and assembly-type of industries;[93][94] however, food and beverage production, as well as printing and publishing remained among the core industries.[93] Major manufacturers are headquartered in the city, including Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia and SK. Notable food and beverage companies include Jinro, whose soju is the most sold alcoholic drink in the world, beating out Smirnoff vodka;[95] top selling beer producers Hite (merged with Jinro) and Oriental Brewery.[96] It also hosts food giants like Seoul Dairy Cooperative, Nongshim Group, Ottogi, CJ, Orion, Maeil Holdings, Namyang Dairy Products and Lotte.\n\n\n\n### Finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yeouido, the main financial district of Seoul\nSeoul hosts large concentration of headquarters of International companies and banks, including 15 companies on Fortune 500 list such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai.[97] Most bank headquarters and the Korea Exchange are located in Yeouido (Yeoui island),[93] which is often called \"South Korea's Wall Street\" and has been serving as the financial center of the city since the 1980s.[98] The Seoul international finance center & SIFC MALL, Hanhwa 63 building, the Hanhwa insurance company head office. Hanhwa is one of the three largest South Korean insurance companies, along with Samsung Life and Gangnam & Kyobo life insurance group.\n\n\n\n### Commerce[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shopping in Seoul\n\n![](image)Myeong-dong is one of the most popular destinations in Seoul.\nThe largest wholesale and retail market in South Korea, the Dongdaemun Market, is located in Seoul.[99] Myeongdong is a shopping and entertainment area in downtown Seoul with mid- to high-end stores, fashion boutiques and international brand outlets.[100] The nearby Namdaemun Market, named after the Namdaemun Gate, is the oldest continually running market in Seoul.[101]\n\n\nInsadong is the cultural art market of Seoul, where traditional and modern Korean artworks, such as paintings, sculptures and calligraphy are sold.[102] Hwanghak-dong Flea Market and Janganpyeong Antique Market also offer antique products.[103][104] Some shops for local designers have opened in Samcheong-dong, where numerous small art galleries are located. While Itaewon had catered mainly to foreign tourists and American soldiers based in the city, Koreans now comprise the majority of visitors to the area.[105] The Gangnam district is one of the most affluent areas in Seoul[105] and is noted for the fashionable and upscale Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong areas and the COEX Mall. Wholesale markets include Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market and Garak Market.\n\n\nThe Yongsan Electronics Market is the largest electronics market in Asia. Electronics markets are Gangbyeon station metro line 2 Techno mart, ENTER6 MALL & Shindorim station Technomart mall complex.[106] Times Square is one of Seoul's largest shopping malls, and contains the world's largest permanent 35 mm cinema screen, the CGV Starium.[107]\n\n\nKorea World Trade Center Complex, which comprises COEX mall, congress center, 3 Inter-continental hotels, Business tower (Asem tower), Residence hotel, Casino and City airport terminal was established in 1988 in time for the Seoul Olympics. The 2nd World trade trade center is being planned at Seoul Olympic stadium complex as MICE HUB by Seoul city. Ex-Kepco head office building was purchased by Hyundai motor group with 9billion USD to build 115-storey Hyundai GBC & hotel complex until 2021. Now ex-kepco 25-storey building is under demolition.\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\nSeoul has been described as the world's \"most wired city\",[108] ranked first in technology readiness by PwC's *Cities of Opportunity* report.[109] Seoul has a very technologically advanced infrastructure.[110][111]\n\n\nSeoul is among the world leaders in Internet connectivity, being the capital of South Korea, which has the world's highest fiber-optic broadband penetration and highest global average internet speeds of 26.1 Mbit/s.[112][113] Since 2015, Seoul has provided free Wi-Fi access in outdoor spaces through a 47.7 billion won ($44 million) project with Internet access at 10,430 parks, streets and other public places.[114] Internet speeds in some apartment buildings reach up to 52.5Gbit/s with assistance from Nokia, and though the average standard consists of 100 Mbit/s services, providers nationwide are rapidly rolling out 1Gbit/s connections at the equivalent of US$20 per month.[115] In addition, the city is served by the KTX high-speed rail and the Seoul Subway, which provides 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, and DMB inside subway cars. 5G will be introduced commercially in March 2019 in Seoul.\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of South Korea\n\n![](image)Bukchon Hanok Village, a traditional Seoul village built during the Joseon era\nThe traditional heart of Seoul is the old Joseon dynasty city, now the downtown area, where most palaces, government offices, corporate headquarters, hotels, and traditional markets are located. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n### Historical architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun)\nSeoul has many historical and cultural landmarks. In Amsa-dong Prehistoric Settlement Site, Gangdong District, neolithic remains were excavated and accidentally discovered by a flood in 1925.[119]\n\n\nUrban and civil planning was a key concept when Seoul was first designed to serve as a capital in the late 14th century. The Joseon dynasty built the \"Five Grand Palaces\" in Seoul—Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Gyeonghuigung—all of which are located in the Jongno and Jung Districts. Among them, Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997 as an \"outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design\". The main palace, Gyeongbokgung, underwent a large-scale restoration project.[120] The palaces are considered exemplary architecture of the Joseon period. Beside the palaces, Unhyeongung is known for being the royal residence of Regent Daewongun, the father of Emperor Gojong at the end of the Joseon Dynasty.\n\n\nSeoul has been surrounded by walls that were built to regulate visitors from other regions and protect the city in case of an invasion. Pungnap Toseong is a flat earthen wall built at the edge of the Han River, which is widely believed to be the site of Wiryeseong. Mongchon Toseong is another earthen wall built during the Baekje period that is now located inside the Olympic Park.[20] The Fortress Wall of Seoul was built early in the Joseon dynasty for protection of the city. After many centuries of destruction and rebuilding, about 2⁄3 of the wall remains, as well as six of the original eight gates. These gates include the south gate Namdaemun and the east gate Dongdaemun. Namdaemun was the oldest wooden gate until a 2008 arson attack, and was re-opened after complete restoration in 2013.[121] Located near the gates are the traditional markets and largest shopping center, Namdaemun Market and Dongdaemun Market.\n\n\n\n### Modern architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lotte World Tower\nVarious high-rise office buildings and residential buildings, like the Gangnam Finance Center, the Tower Palace, Namsan Seoul Tower, and the Lotte World Tower, dominate the city's skyline. The tallest building is Lotte World Tower, reaching a height of 555m. It opened to the public in April 2017. It is also the 6th highest building in the world.\n\n\nThe World Trade Center Seoul, located in Gangnam District, hosts various expositions and conferences. Also in Gangnam District is the COEX Mall, a large indoor shopping and entertainment complex. Downstream from Gangnam District is Yeouido, an island that is home to the National Assembly, major broadcasting studios, and a number of large office buildings, as well as the Korea Finance Building and the Yoido Full Gospel Church. The Olympic Stadium, Olympic Park, and Lotte World are located in Songpa District, on the south side of the Han River, upstream from Gangnam District. Three new modern landmarks of Seoul are Dongdaemun Design Plaza & Park, designed by Zaha Hadid, the new wave-shaped Seoul City Hall, by Yoo Kerl of iArc, and the Lotte World Tower, the 6th tallest building in the world designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox.\n\n\nIn 2010 Seoul was designated the World Design Capital for the year.[122]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Seoul\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Korea\n![](image)The War Memorial of Korea\nSeoul is home to 115 museums,[123] including four national and nine official municipal museums. The National Museum of Korea has a collection of 220,000 artifacts.[124] The National Folk Museum is located on the grounds of Gyeongbokgung and focuses on the daily life of historical Koreans.[125] Bukchon Hanok Village and Namsangol Hanok Village are old residential districts consisting of *hanok* (traditional Korean houses).[126][127]\n\n\nThe War Memorial covers the history of wars that Korea has been involved with, especially the Korean War.[128][129] Seodaemun Prison is a former prison built during the Japanese occupation, and is used as a historic museum.[130]\n\n\nThe Seoul Museum of Art, Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, and Ilmin Museum of Art are art museums in the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Religious monuments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Myeongdong Cathedral\nThe city has buildings related to a number of religions. The Wongudan altar has been used since the Three Kingdoms Period.[*citation needed*] There are also a number of Confucian shrines, such as Jongmyo, Sajikdan, Munmyo, and Dongmyo. For Buddhism, Jogyesa is the headquarters of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. Hwagyesa and Bongeunsa are also major Buddhist temples in Seoul.\n\n\nThe Myeongdong Cathedral is a landmark of the Myeongdong, Jung District.

Its system dates back to the era of the Korean Empire, when the first streetcar lines were laid and a railroad linking Seoul and Incheon was completed.[135] Seoul's most important streetcar line ran along Jongno until it was replaced by Line 1 of the subway system in the early 1970s. Other notable streets in downtown Seoul include Euljiro, Teheranno, Sejongno, Chungmuro, Yulgongno, and Toegyero. There are nine major subway lines stretching for more than 250 km (155 mi), with one additional line planned. As of 2010[update], 25% of the population has a commute time of an hour or longer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Buses\n\n![](image)Seoul buses\nSeoul's bus system is operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government (S.M.G.), with four primary bus configurations available servicing most of the city. Seoul has many large intercity/express bus terminals. These buses connect Seoul with cities throughout South Korea. The Seoul Express Bus Terminal, Central City Terminal and Seoul Nambu Terminal are located in the district of Seocho District. In addition, East Seoul Bus Terminal in Gwangjin District and Sangbong Terminal in Jungnang District handles traffics mainly from Gangwon and Chungcheong provinces.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Urban rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul Station\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Subway\n\nSeoul has a comprehensive urban railway network of 21 rapid transit, light metro and commuter lines that interconnects every district of the city and the surrounding areas of Incheon, Gyeonggi province, western Gangwon province, and northern Chungnam province. With more than 8 million passengers per day, the subway is one of the busiest subway systems in the world and the largest in the world, with a total track length of 940 km (580 mi). In addition, in order to cope with the various modes of transport, Seoul's metropolitan government employs several mathematicians to coordinate the subway, bus, and traffic schedules into one timetable. The various lines are run by Korail, Seoul Metro, NeoTrans Co. Ltd., AREX, and Seoul Metro Line 9 Corporation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Train[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KTX Sancheon\nSeoul is connected to every major city in South Korea by rail. Most major South Korean cities are linked via the KTX high-speed train, which has a normal operation speed of more than 300 km/h (186 mph). The Mugunghwa and Saemaeul trains also stop at all major stations. Major railroad stations include:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* Seoul Station, Yongsan District: Gyeongbu line (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa-ho)\n* Yongsan station, Yongsan District: Honam line (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa), Jeolla/Janghang lines (Saemaul/Mugunghwa)\n* Yeongdeungpo station, Yeongdeungpo District: Gyeongbu/Honam/Janghang lines (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Saemaul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa)\n* Cheongnyangni station, Dongdaemun District: Gyeongchun/Jungang/Yeongdong/Taebaek lines (ITX-Cheongchun/ITX-Saemaeul/Mugunghwa)\n* Suseo station (HSR), Gangnam District: Suseo HSR (SRT)\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSeoul is served by two international airports, Incheon International Airport and Gimpo International Airport.\n\n\nGimpo International Airport opened in 1939 as an airfield for the Japanese Imperial Army and opened for civil aircraft in 1957. Since the opening of Incheon International, Gimpo International handles domestic flights along with some short haul international flights to Tokyo Haneda, Osaka Kansai, Taipei Songshan, Shanghai Hongqiao, and Beijing Capital although flights to Osaka Kansai and Beijing Capital also operate from Incheon International.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon International Airport opened in March 2001 in Yeongjong island. It is now responsible for major international flights. Incheon International Airport is Asia's eighth busiest airport in terms of passengers, the world's fourth busiest airport by cargo traffic, and the world's eighth busiest airport in terms of international passengers in 2014. In 2016, 57,765,397 passengers used the airport. Incheon International Airport opened terminal 2 on 18 January 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon and Gimpo are linked to Seoul by expressway, and to each other by the AREX to Seoul Station. Intercity bus services are available to various destinations around the country.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nCycling is becoming increasingly popular in Seoul and in the entire country. Both banks of the Han River have cycling paths that run all the way across the city along the river. In addition, Seoul introduced in 2015 a bicycle-sharing system named Ddareungi (and named Seoul Bike in English).[136]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in South Korea and List of universities in Seoul\n\n### Universities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of Seoul National University\nSeoul is home to the majority of South Korea's most prestigious universities, including Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Korea University.\n\n\nSeoul ranked 2nd on the QS Best Student Cities 2023.[137]\n\n\n\n### Secondary education[edit]\n\n\nCompulsory education lasts from grade 1–9 (six years of elementary school and 3 years of middle school).[138] Students spend six years in elementary school, three years in middle school, and three years in high school. Secondary schools generally require students to wear uniforms. There is an exit exam for graduating from high school and many students proceeding to the university level are required to take the College Scholastic Ability Test that is held every November. Although there is a test for non-high school graduates, called school qualification exam, most Koreans take the test.\n\n\nSeoul is home to various specialized schools, including three science high schools, and six foreign language High Schools. Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education comprises 235 College-Preparatory High Schools, 80 Vocational Schools, 377 Middle Schools, and 33 Special Education Schools as of 2009[update].\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of diplomatic missions in South Korea\n\nSeoul is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.

The broader Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing Gyeonggi province and Incheon metropolitan city, emerged as the world's fourth largest metropolitan economy in 2014, trailing only Tokyo, New York City, and Los Angeles, hosting more than half of South Korea's population. Although Seoul's population peaked at slightly over 10 million, it has gradually decreased since 2014, standing at approximately 9.97 million residents as of 2020. Seoul is the seat of the Korean government.\n\n\nSeoul's history traces back to 18 BC when it was founded by the people of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. During the Joseon dynasty, Seoul was officially designated as the capital, surrounded by the Fortress Wall of Seoul. In the early 20th century, Seoul was occupied by the Japanese Empire, temporarily renamed \"Gyeongseong.\" The Korean War brought fierce battles, with Seoul changing hands four times and leaving the city mostly in ruins. Nevertheless, the city has since undergone significant reconstruction and rapid urbanization.\n\n\nSeoul was rated Asia's most livable city, with the second-highest quality of life globally according to Arcadis in 2015 and a GDP per capita (PPP) of approximately $40,000. 15 *Fortune* Global 500 companies, including industry giants such as Samsung,[9] LG, and Hyundai, are headquartered in the Seoul Capital Area, which has major technology hubs, such as Gangnam and Digital Media City,[10]. Seoul is ranked seventh in the Global Power City Index and the Global Financial Centres Index, and is one of the five leading hosts of global conferences.[11] The city has also hosted major events such as the 1986 Asian Games, the 1988 Summer Olympics, and the 2010 G20 Seoul summit.\n\n\nSeoul is geographically set in a mountainous and hilly terrain, with Bukhan Mountain positioned on its northern edge. Within the Seoul Capital Area lie five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong, and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty.[12] Furthermore, Seoul has witnessed a surge in modern architectural development, with iconic landmarks including the N Seoul Tower, the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, the Trade Tower, COEX, IFC Seoul, and Parc1. Seoul was named the World Design Capital in 2010 and has served as the national hub for the music, entertainment, and cultural industries that have propelled K-pop and the Korean Wave to international prominence.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Seoul\n\nThe city has been known in the past by the names Wiryeseong (위례성; 慰禮城, during the Baekje era), Bukhansangun (북한산군; 北漢山郡 during the Goguryeo era), Namcheon (남천; 南川,[13] during the Silla era), Hanyang (한양; 漢陽, during the Northern and Southern States period), Namgyeong(남경; 南京, during Goryeo era), Hanseong (한성; 漢城, during the Joseon era), and Keijō (京城) or Gyeongseong (경성; 京城) during Japanese rule.[14]\n\n\nDuring Japan's annexation of Korea, *Hanseong* (漢城) was renamed *Keijō* (京城) by the Imperial authorities to prevent confusion with the Hanja '漢' (a transliteration of an ancient Korean word *Han* (한) meaning \"great\"), which also refers to Han people or the Han dynasty in Chinese and in Japanese is a term for \"China\".[15]\n\n\nAfter World War II and the liberation of Korea, the city took its present name, which originated from the Korean word meaning \"capital city\", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, *Seorabeol* (서라벌; 徐羅伐), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.[16] Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name *Geumseong* (金城, literally \"Gold Castle or City\" or \"Metal Castle or City\"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name *Seorabeol* had the same meaning as *Geumseong*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding Hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). On 18 January 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic *Hancheng* (simplified Chinese: 汉城; traditional Chinese: 漢城; pinyin: *Hànchéng*) to *Shou'er* (首尔; 首爾; *Shǒu'ěr*).[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Seoul\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Seoul.\n![](image)The Fortress Wall of Seoul\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSettlement of the Han River area, where present-day Seoul is located, began around 4000 BC.[19]\n\n\nSeoul is first recorded as Wiryeseong, the capital of Baekje (founded in 18 BC) in the northeastern area of modern Seoul.[19] There are several city walls remaining in the area that date from this time. Pungnaptoseong, an earthen wall located southeast Seoul, is widely believed to have been at the main Wiryeseong site.[20] As the Three Kingdoms competed for this strategic region, control passed from Baekje to Goguryeo in the 5th century.[21]\n\n\nHowever, according to Samguk Sagi, both Baekje and Silla described the land as frontier border of Baekje, not as the capital region.[22][23] Moreover, Jinheung Taewang Stele found at current day Bukhansan tells that the place was underdeveloped as of 6th century AD,[13] suggesting that the first capital Wiryeseong was not located in or nearby Seoul.\n\n\nIn July or August 553, Silla took the control of the region from Baekje, and the city became a part of newly established Sin Province (신주; 新州).[22][23] Sin (新) has both meaning of \"New\" and \"Silla\", thus literally means New Silla Province.\n\n\nIn November 555, Jinheung Taewang made royal visit to Bukhansan, and inspected the borderline.[24] In 557, Silla abolished Sin Province, and established Bukhansan Province (북한산주; 北漢山州).[25] The word Hanseong (한성; 漢城; lit. Han Fortress) appears on the stone wall of \"Pyongyang Fortress\", which was presumably built in the mid to late 6th century AD over period of 42 years, located in Pyongyang, while there is no evidence that Seoul had name Hanseong dating the three kingdoms and earlier period.[26][27][28][29][30]\n\n\nIn 568, Jinheung Taewang made another royal visit to the northern border, visited Hanseong, and stayed in Namcheon on his way back to the capital. During his stay, he set Jinheung Taewang Stele, abolished Bukhansan Province, and established Namcheon Province (남천주; 南川州; South River Province), appointing the city as the provincial capital.[13][31] Based on the naming system, the actual name of Han River during this time was likely Namcheon (Nam River) itself or should have the word ending with \"cheon\" (천; 川) not \"gang\" (강; 江) nor \"su\" (수; 水). In addition, \"Bukhansan\" Jinheung Stele clearly states that Silla had possession of Hanseong (modern day Pyongyang), thus Bukhansan has to be located north of Hanseong. Modern day Pyongyang was not Pyongyang, Taedong River was likely Han River, and Bukhansan was not Bukhansan during the three kingdoms period.[13][32] Moreover, Pyongyang was a common noun meaning capital used by Goguryeo and Goryeo dynasties, similar to Seoul.[33]\n\n\nIn 603, Goguryeo attacked Bukhansanseong (북한산성; 北漢山城; Bukhan Mountain Fortress), which Silla ended up winning.[34][35] In 604, Silla abolished Namcheon Province, and reestablished Bukhansan Province in order to strengthen the northern border. The city lost its provincial capital position and was put under Bukhansan Province once again.[36] This further proves that Bukhansan was located in the North of modern-day Pyongyang as changing the provincial name and objective would not be required if Bukhansan was located within Seoul.\n\n\nIn the 11th century Goryeo, which succeeded Unified Silla, built a summer palace in Seoul, which was referred to as the \"Southern Capital\". It was only from this period that Seoul became a larger settlement.[19]\n\n\n\n### Joseon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Seoul created 1825–1835 by Kim Jeong-ho and designated National Treasure no 853.\nWhen Joseon replaced Goryeo, the capital was moved to Seoul (also known as Hanyang or Hanseong), where it remained until the fall of the dynasty. The Gyeongbok Palace, built in the 14th century, served as the royal residence until 1592. The other large palace, Changdeokgung, constructed in 1405, served as the main royal palace from 1611 to 1872.[19] After Joseon changed its name to the Korean Empire in 1897, Hwangseong also designated Seoul.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nOriginally, the city was entirely surrounded by a massive circular stone wall to provide its citizens security from wild animals, thieves and attacks. The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (except along Bugaksan Mountain (북악산; 北岳山), north of the downtown area[37]), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun).[38] During the Joseon dynasty, the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the Bosingak belfry.[39] In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to introduce electricity in the royal palace, built by the Edison Illuminating Company[40] and a decade later Seoul also implemented electrical street lights.[41]\n\n\nMuch of the development was due to trade with foreign countries like France and the United States. For example, the Seoul Electric Company, Seoul Electric Trolley Company, and Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company were all joint Korean–U.S. owned enterprises.[42] In 1904, an American by the name of Angus Hamilton visited the city and said, \"The streets of Seoul are magnificent, spacious, clean, admirably made and well-drained. The narrow, dirty lanes have been widened, gutters have been covered, roadways broadened. Seoul is within measurable distance of becoming the highest, most interesting and cleanest city in the East.\"[43]\n\n\n\n### Japanese annexation of Korea[edit]\n\n\nAfter the annexation treaty in 1910, Japan annexed Korea and renamed the city Gyeongseong (\"Kyongsong\" in Korean and \"Keijo\" in Japanese). Japanese technology was imported, the city walls were removed, some of the gates demolished. Roads became paved and Western-style buildings were constructed. The city was liberated by U.S. forces at the end of World War II.[19]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\nIn 1945, the city was officially named Seoul, and was designated as a special city in 1949.[19]\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Seoul changed hands between the Soviet/Chinese-backed North Korean forces and the American-backed South Korean forces four times: falling to the North Koreans in the June 1950 First Battle of Seoul, recaptured by UN forces in the September 1950 Second Battle of Seoul, falling to a combined Chinese/North Korean force in the January 1951 Third Battle of Seoul, and finally being recaptured once more by UN forces in Operation Ripper during the spring of 1951.[44][45] The extensive fighting left the city heavily damaged after the war. The capital was temporarily relocated to Busan.[19] One estimate of the extensive damage states that after the war, at least 191,000 buildings, 55,000 houses, and 1,000 factories lay in ruins. In addition, a flood of refugees had entered Seoul during the war, swelling the population of the city and its metropolitan area to an estimated 1.5 million by 1955.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the war, Seoul began to focus on reconstruction and modernization. As South Korea's economy started to grow rapidly from the 1960s, urbanization also accelerated and workers began to move to Seoul and other larger cities.[46] From the 1970s, the size of Seoul administrative area greatly expanded as it annexed a number of towns and villages from several surrounding counties.[47]\n\n\nUntil 1972, Seoul was claimed by North Korea as its *de jure* capital, being specified as such in Article 103 of the 1948 North Korean constitution.[48]\n\n\nSouth Korea's 2019 population was estimated at 51.71 million, and according to the 2018 Population and Housing Census, 49.8% of the population resided in the Seoul metropolitan area. This was up by 0.7% from 49.1% in 2010, showing a distinct trend toward the concentration of the population in the capital.[49] Seoul has become the economic, political and cultural hub of the country,[19] with several Fortune Global 500 companies, including Samsung, SK Holdings, Hyundai, POSCO and LG Group headquartered there.[50]\n\n\nSeoul was the host city of the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Summer Olympics as well as one of the venues of the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\nVarious views of Seoul from the 63 Building in July, 2019\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Han River at sunrise\nSeoul is in the northwest of South Korea. Seoul proper comprises 605.25 km2 (233.69 sq mi),[3] with a radius of approximately 15 km (9 mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Seoul\n\n\n\n|  Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 17\n\n\n\n2\n\n−6\n | 28\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 37\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 73\n\n\n\n18\n\n8\n | 104\n\n\n\n24\n\n14\n | 130\n\n\n\n28\n\n19\n | 414\n\n\n\n29\n\n22\n | 348\n\n\n\n30\n\n23\n | 142\n\n\n\n26\n\n18\n | 52\n\n\n\n20\n\n11\n | 51\n\n\n\n12\n\n4\n | 23\n\n\n\n4\n\n−3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 0.7\n\n\n\n36\n\n22\n | 1.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n52\n\n35\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n64\n\n46\n | 4.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n56\n | 5.1\n\n\n\n82\n\n66\n | 16\n\n\n\n84\n\n72\n | 14\n\n\n\n86\n\n73\n | 5.6\n\n\n\n79\n\n64\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n68\n\n51\n | 2\n\n\n\n53\n\n38\n | 0.9\n\n\n\n40\n\n26\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nSeoul has a humid continental (Köppen: *Dwa*) or humid subtropical climate (*Cwa*, by −3 °C or 26.6 °F isotherm), influenced by the monsoons; there is great variation in temperature and precipitation throughout the year.[51][52] The suburbs of Seoul are generally cooler than the center of Seoul because of the urban heat island effect.[53] Summers are hot and humid, with the East Asian monsoon taking place from June until September. August, the hottest month, has average high and low temperatures of 30.0 and 22.9 °C (86 and 73 °F) with higher temperatures possible. Heat index values can surpass 40 °C (104.0 °F) at the height of summer. \nWinters are usually cold to freezing with average January high and low temperatures of 2.1 and −5.5 °C (35.8 and 22.1 °F), and are generally much drier than summers, with an average of 24.9 days of snow annually. Sometimes, temperatures drop dramatically to below −10 °C (14 °F), and on some occasions as low as −15 °C (5 °F) in the mid winter period of January and February. Temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F) have been recorded.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Seoul (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1907–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 14.4(57.9)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 38.4(101.1)\n | 39.6(103.3)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 30.1(86.2)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 39.6(103.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 27.6(81.7)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 26.2(79.2)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −2.0(28.4)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −5.5(22.1)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | −3.4(25.9)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −22.5(−8.5)\n | −19.6(−3.3)\n | −14.1(6.6)\n | −4.3(24.3)\n | 2.4(36.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | −5.1(22.8)\n | −11.9(10.6)\n | −23.1(−9.6)\n | −23.1(−9.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 16.8(0.66)\n | 28.2(1.11)\n | 36.9(1.45)\n | 72.9(2.87)\n | 103.6(4.08)\n | 129.5(5.10)\n | 414.4(16.31)\n | 348.2(13.71)\n | 141.5(5.57)\n | 52.2(2.06)\n | 51.1(2.01)\n | 22.6(0.89)\n | 1,417.9(55.82)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 6.1\n | 5.8\n | 7.0\n | 8.4\n | 8.6\n | 9.9\n | 16.3\n | 14.7\n | 9.1\n | 6.1\n | 8.8\n | 7.8\n | 108.6\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 7.1\n | 5.1\n | 2.8\n | 0.2\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 2.3\n | 6.4\n | 23.9\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 56.2\n | 54.6\n | 54.6\n | 54.8\n | 59.7\n | 65.7\n | 76.2\n | 73.5\n | 66.4\n | 61.8\n | 60.4\n | 57.8\n | 61.8\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 169.6\n | 170.8\n | 198.2\n | 206.3\n | 223.0\n | 189.1\n | 123.6\n | 156.1\n | 179.7\n | 206.5\n | 157.3\n | 162.9\n | 2,143.1\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 52.3\n | 53.6\n | 51.0\n | 51.9\n | 48.4\n | 41.2\n | 26.8\n | 36.2\n | 47.2\n | 57.1\n | 50.2\n | 51.1\n | 46.4\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[54][55][56] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[57] Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[58] |\n\n### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Air pollution in South Korea\n\n![](image)Very Unhealthy\n Unhealthy\n Unhealthy for sensitive groups\nModerate\n Good\nAccording to the Environmental Performance Index 2016, South Korea ranked 173rd out of 180 countries in terms of air quality. More than 50 percent of the populations in South Korea are exposed to dangerous levels of fine dust.[59][60]\nAir pollution is a major issue in Seoul.[61][62][63][64] According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database,[65] the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2014 was 24 micrograms per cubic meter (1.0×10−5 gr/cu ft), which is 2.4 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines[66] for the annual mean PM2.5. The Seoul Metropolitan Government monitors and publicly shares real-time air quality data.[67]\n\n\nSince the early 1960s, the Ministry of Environment has implemented a range of policies and air pollutant standards to improve and manage air quality for its people.[68] The \"Special Act on the Improvement of Air Quality in the Seoul Metropolitan Area\" was passed in December 2003. Its 1st Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2005–2014) focused on improving the concentrations of PM10 and nitrogen dioxide by reducing emissions.[69] As a result, the annual average PM10 concentrations decreased from 70.0 μg/m3 in 2001 to 44.4 μg/m3 in 2011[70] and 46 μg/m3 in 2014.[65] As of 2014, the annual average PM10 concentration was still at least twice than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines.[66] The 2nd Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2015–2024) added PM2.5 and ozone to its list of managed pollutants.[71]\n\n\nAsian dust, emissions from Seoul and in general from the rest of South Korea, as well as emissions from China, all contribute to Seoul's air quality.[62][72] A partnership between researchers in South Korea and the United States is conducting an international air quality field study in Korea (KORUS-AQ) to determine how much each source contributes.[73][*needs update*]\n\n\nBesides air quality, greenhouse gas emissions represent hot issues in South Korea since the country is among top-10 strongest emitters in the world. Seoul is the strongest hotspot of greenhouse gas emissions in the country and according to satellite data, the persistent carbon dioxide anomaly over the city is one of the strongest in the world.[74]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)Seoul City Hall\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Government is the local government for Seoul, and is responsible for the administration and provision of various services to the city, including correctional institutions, education, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. It is headed by a mayor and three vice mayors, and is divided into 25 autonomous districts and 522 administrative neighborhoods.[75][76]\n\n\n\n## Administrative districts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Seoul\n\n![](image)Districts of Seoul\nSeoul is divided into 25 gu (구; 區) (district).[77] The *gu* vary greatly in area (from 10 to 47 km2 or 3.9 to 18.1 sq mi) and population (from fewer than 140,000 to 630,000). Songpa has the most people, while Seocho has the largest area. The government of each gu handles many of the functions that are handled by city governments in other jurisdictions. Each *gu* is divided into \"*dong*\" (동; 洞) or neighborhoods. Some gu have only a few dong while others like Jongno District have a very large number of distinct neighborhoods. Gu of Seoul consist of 423 administrative dongs (행정동) in total.[77] *Dong* are also sub-divided into 13,787 *tong* (통; 統), which are further divided into 102,796 *ban* in total.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul population pyramid in 2022\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 1,021,000 | —     |\n| 1960 | 2,361,000 | +8.74% |\n| 1970 | 5,312,000 | +8.45% |\n| 1980 | 8,244,000 | +4.49% |\n| 1990 | 10,518,000 | +2.47% |\n| 2000 | 9,879,000 | −0.62% |\n| 2010 | 9,796,000 | −0.08% |\n| 2020 | 9,963,000 | +0.17% |\n| source:[78] |\n\n\nSeoul proper is noted for its population density, which is almost twice that of New York City and eight times greater than Rome. Its metropolitan area was the most densely populated among OECD countries in Asia in 2012, and second worldwide after that of Paris.[79] As of 2015, the population was 9.86 million,[80] in 2012, it was 10.44 million. As of 2021, the population is 9.59 million.[81][82] As of the end of June 2011, 10.29 million Republic of Korea citizens lived in the city. This was a 0.24% decrease from the end of 2010. The population of Seoul has been dropping since the early 1990s, the reasons being the high costs of living, urban sprawling to Gyeonggi region's satellite bed cities and an aging population.[80]\n\n\nAs of 2016, the number of foreigners living in Seoul was 404,037, 22.9% of the total foreign population in South Korea.[83] As of June 2011, 186,631 foreigners were Chinese citizens of Korean ancestry. This was an 8.84% increase from the end of 2010 and a 12.85% increase from June 2010. The next largest group was Chinese citizens who are not of Korean ethnicity; 29,901 of them resided in Seoul. The next highest group consisted of the 9,999 United States citizens who were not of Korean ancestry. The next highest group were Taiwanese citizens, at 8,717.[84]\n\n\nThe two major religions in Seoul are Christianity and Buddhism. Other religions include Muism (indigenous religion) and Confucianism. Seoul is home to one of the world's largest Christian congregations, Yoido Full Gospel Church, which has around 830,000 members.[85] According to the 2015 census, 10.8% of the population follows Buddhism and 35% follows Christianity (24.3% Protestantism and 10.7% Catholicism). 53.6% of the population is irreligious.[86]\n\n\n\nReligion in Seoul (2015)[86]\n\n\n\nNot religious (53.6%)\nProtestantism (24.3%)\nBuddhism (10.8%)\nCatholicism (10.7%)\nOther (0.6%)\n\nSeoul is home to the world's largest modern university founded by a Buddhist Order, Dongguk University.[87] Native Seoulites tend to speak the Gyeonggi dialect of Korean.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of South Korea\n\n![](image)Gangnam Commercial Area\nSeoul is the business and financial hub of South Korea. Although it accounts for only 0.6 percent of the nation's land area, 48.3 percent of South Korea's bank deposits were held in Seoul in 2003,[88] and the city generated 23 percent of the country's GDP overall in 2012.[89] In 2008 the Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index ranked Seoul No.9.[90] The Global Financial Centres Index in 2015 listed Seoul as the 6th financially most competitive city in the world.[91] The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Seoul 15th in the list of \"Overall 2025 City Competitiveness\" regarding future competitiveness of cities.[92]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nThe traditional, labor-intensive manufacturing industries have been continuously replaced by information technology, electronics and assembly-type of industries;[93][94] however, food and beverage production, as well as printing and publishing remained among the core industries.[93] Major manufacturers are headquartered in the city, including Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia and SK. Notable food and beverage companies include Jinro, whose soju is the most sold alcoholic drink in the world, beating out Smirnoff vodka;[95] top selling beer producers Hite (merged with Jinro) and Oriental Brewery.[96] It also hosts food giants like Seoul Dairy Cooperative, Nongshim Group, Ottogi, CJ, Orion, Maeil Holdings, Namyang Dairy Products and Lotte.\n\n\n\n### Finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yeouido, the main financial district of Seoul\nSeoul hosts large concentration of headquarters of International companies and banks, including 15 companies on Fortune 500 list such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai.[97] Most bank headquarters and the Korea Exchange are located in Yeouido (Yeoui island),[93] which is often called \"South Korea's Wall Street\" and has been serving as the financial center of the city since the 1980s.[98] The Seoul international finance center & SIFC MALL, Hanhwa 63 building, the Hanhwa insurance company head office. Hanhwa is one of the three largest South Korean insurance companies, along with Samsung Life and Gangnam & Kyobo life insurance group.\n\n\n\n### Commerce[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shopping in Seoul\n\n![](image)Myeong-dong is one of the most popular destinations in Seoul.\nThe largest wholesale and retail market in South Korea, the Dongdaemun Market, is located in Seoul.[99] Myeongdong is a shopping and entertainment area in downtown Seoul with mid- to high-end stores, fashion boutiques and international brand outlets.[100] The nearby Namdaemun Market, named after the Namdaemun Gate, is the oldest continually running market in Seoul.[101]\n\n\nInsadong is the cultural art market of Seoul, where traditional and modern Korean artworks, such as paintings, sculptures and calligraphy are sold.[102] Hwanghak-dong Flea Market and Janganpyeong Antique Market also offer antique products.[103][104] Some shops for local designers have opened in Samcheong-dong, where numerous small art galleries are located. While Itaewon had catered mainly to foreign tourists and American soldiers based in the city, Koreans now comprise the majority of visitors to the area.[105] The Gangnam district is one of the most affluent areas in Seoul[105] and is noted for the fashionable and upscale Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong areas and the COEX Mall. Wholesale markets include Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market and Garak Market.\n\n\nThe Yongsan Electronics Market is the largest electronics market in Asia. Electronics markets are Gangbyeon station metro line 2 Techno mart, ENTER6 MALL & Shindorim station Technomart mall complex.[106] Times Square is one of Seoul's largest shopping malls, and contains the world's largest permanent 35 mm cinema screen, the CGV Starium.[107]\n\n\nKorea World Trade Center Complex, which comprises COEX mall, congress center, 3 Inter-continental hotels, Business tower (Asem tower), Residence hotel, Casino and City airport terminal was established in 1988 in time for the Seoul Olympics. The 2nd World trade trade center is being planned at Seoul Olympic stadium complex as MICE HUB by Seoul city. Ex-Kepco head office building was purchased by Hyundai motor group with 9billion USD to build 115-storey Hyundai GBC & hotel complex until 2021. Now ex-kepco 25-storey building is under demolition.\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\nSeoul has been described as the world's \"most wired city\",[108] ranked first in technology readiness by PwC's *Cities of Opportunity* report.[109] Seoul has a very technologically advanced infrastructure.[110][111]\n\n\nSeoul is among the world leaders in Internet connectivity, being the capital of South Korea, which has the world's highest fiber-optic broadband penetration and highest global average internet speeds of 26.1 Mbit/s.[112][113] Since 2015, Seoul has provided free Wi-Fi access in outdoor spaces through a 47.7 billion won ($44 million) project with Internet access at 10,430 parks, streets and other public places.[114] Internet speeds in some apartment buildings reach up to 52.5Gbit/s with assistance from Nokia, and though the average standard consists of 100 Mbit/s services, providers nationwide are rapidly rolling out 1Gbit/s connections at the equivalent of US$20 per month.[115] In addition, the city is served by the KTX high-speed rail and the Seoul Subway, which provides 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, and DMB inside subway cars. 5G will be introduced commercially in March 2019 in Seoul.\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of South Korea\n\n![](image)Bukchon Hanok Village, a traditional Seoul village built during the Joseon era\nThe traditional heart of Seoul is the old Joseon dynasty city, now the downtown area, where most palaces, government offices, corporate headquarters, hotels, and traditional markets are located. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n### Historical architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun)\nSeoul has many historical and cultural landmarks. In Amsa-dong Prehistoric Settlement Site, Gangdong District, neolithic remains were excavated and accidentally discovered by a flood in 1925.[119]\n\n\nUrban and civil planning was a key concept when Seoul was first designed to serve as a capital in the late 14th century. The Joseon dynasty built the \"Five Grand Palaces\" in Seoul—Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Gyeonghuigung—all of which are located in the Jongno and Jung Districts. Among them, Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997 as an \"outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design\". The main palace, Gyeongbokgung, underwent a large-scale restoration project.[120] The palaces are considered exemplary architecture of the Joseon period. Beside the palaces, Unhyeongung is known for being the royal residence of Regent Daewongun, the father of Emperor Gojong at the end of the Joseon Dynasty.\n\n\nSeoul has been surrounded by walls that were built to regulate visitors from other regions and protect the city in case of an invasion. Pungnap Toseong is a flat earthen wall built at the edge of the Han River, which is widely believed to be the site of Wiryeseong. Mongchon Toseong is another earthen wall built during the Baekje period that is now located inside the Olympic Park.[20] The Fortress Wall of Seoul was built early in the Joseon dynasty for protection of the city. After many centuries of destruction and rebuilding, about 2⁄3 of the wall remains, as well as six of the original eight gates. These gates include the south gate Namdaemun and the east gate Dongdaemun. Namdaemun was the oldest wooden gate until a 2008 arson attack, and was re-opened after complete restoration in 2013.[121] Located near the gates are the traditional markets and largest shopping center, Namdaemun Market and Dongdaemun Market.\n\n\n\n### Modern architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lotte World Tower\nVarious high-rise office buildings and residential buildings, like the Gangnam Finance Center, the Tower Palace, Namsan Seoul Tower, and the Lotte World Tower, dominate the city's skyline. The tallest building is Lotte World Tower, reaching a height of 555m. It opened to the public in April 2017. It is also the 6th highest building in the world.\n\n\nThe World Trade Center Seoul, located in Gangnam District, hosts various expositions and conferences. Also in Gangnam District is the COEX Mall, a large indoor shopping and entertainment complex. Downstream from Gangnam District is Yeouido, an island that is home to the National Assembly, major broadcasting studios, and a number of large office buildings, as well as the Korea Finance Building and the Yoido Full Gospel Church. The Olympic Stadium, Olympic Park, and Lotte World are located in Songpa District, on the south side of the Han River, upstream from Gangnam District. Three new modern landmarks of Seoul are Dongdaemun Design Plaza & Park, designed by Zaha Hadid, the new wave-shaped Seoul City Hall, by Yoo Kerl of iArc, and the Lotte World Tower, the 6th tallest building in the world designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox.\n\n\nIn 2010 Seoul was designated the World Design Capital for the year.[122]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Seoul\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Korea\n![](image)The War Memorial of Korea\nSeoul is home to 115 museums,[123] including four national and nine official municipal museums. The National Museum of Korea has a collection of 220,000 artifacts.[124] The National Folk Museum is located on the grounds of Gyeongbokgung and focuses on the daily life of historical Koreans.[125] Bukchon Hanok Village and Namsangol Hanok Village are old residential districts consisting of *hanok* (traditional Korean houses).[126][127]\n\n\nThe War Memorial covers the history of wars that Korea has been involved with, especially the Korean War.[128][129] Seodaemun Prison is a former prison built during the Japanese occupation, and is used as a historic museum.[130]\n\n\nThe Seoul Museum of Art, Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, and Ilmin Museum of Art are art museums in the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Religious monuments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Myeongdong Cathedral\nThe city has buildings related to a number of religions. The Wongudan altar has been used since the Three Kingdoms Period.[*citation needed*] There are also a number of Confucian shrines, such as Jongmyo, Sajikdan, Munmyo, and Dongmyo. For Buddhism, Jogyesa is the headquarters of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. Hwagyesa and Bongeunsa are also major Buddhist temples in Seoul.\n\n\nThe Myeongdong Cathedral is a landmark of the Myeongdong, Jung District.

Its system dates back to the era of the Korean Empire, when the first streetcar lines were laid and a railroad linking Seoul and Incheon was completed.[135] Seoul's most important streetcar line ran along Jongno until it was replaced by Line 1 of the subway system in the early 1970s. Other notable streets in downtown Seoul include Euljiro, Teheranno, Sejongno, Chungmuro, Yulgongno, and Toegyero. There are nine major subway lines stretching for more than 250 km (155 mi), with one additional line planned. As of 2010[update], 25% of the population has a commute time of an hour or longer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Buses\n\n![](image)Seoul buses\nSeoul's bus system is operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government (S.M.G.), with four primary bus configurations available servicing most of the city. Seoul has many large intercity/express bus terminals. These buses connect Seoul with cities throughout South Korea. The Seoul Express Bus Terminal, Central City Terminal and Seoul Nambu Terminal are located in the district of Seocho District. In addition, East Seoul Bus Terminal in Gwangjin District and Sangbong Terminal in Jungnang District handles traffics mainly from Gangwon and Chungcheong provinces.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Urban rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul Station\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Subway\n\nSeoul has a comprehensive urban railway network of 21 rapid transit, light metro and commuter lines that interconnects every district of the city and the surrounding areas of Incheon, Gyeonggi province, western Gangwon province, and northern Chungnam province. With more than 8 million passengers per day, the subway is one of the busiest subway systems in the world and the largest in the world, with a total track length of 940 km (580 mi). In addition, in order to cope with the various modes of transport, Seoul's metropolitan government employs several mathematicians to coordinate the subway, bus, and traffic schedules into one timetable. The various lines are run by Korail, Seoul Metro, NeoTrans Co. Ltd., AREX, and Seoul Metro Line 9 Corporation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Train[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KTX Sancheon\nSeoul is connected to every major city in South Korea by rail. Most major South Korean cities are linked via the KTX high-speed train, which has a normal operation speed of more than 300 km/h (186 mph). The Mugunghwa and Saemaeul trains also stop at all major stations. Major railroad stations include:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* Seoul Station, Yongsan District: Gyeongbu line (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa-ho)\n* Yongsan station, Yongsan District: Honam line (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa), Jeolla/Janghang lines (Saemaul/Mugunghwa)\n* Yeongdeungpo station, Yeongdeungpo District: Gyeongbu/Honam/Janghang lines (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Saemaul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa)\n* Cheongnyangni station, Dongdaemun District: Gyeongchun/Jungang/Yeongdong/Taebaek lines (ITX-Cheongchun/ITX-Saemaeul/Mugunghwa)\n* Suseo station (HSR), Gangnam District: Suseo HSR (SRT)\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSeoul is served by two international airports, Incheon International Airport and Gimpo International Airport.\n\n\nGimpo International Airport opened in 1939 as an airfield for the Japanese Imperial Army and opened for civil aircraft in 1957. Since the opening of Incheon International, Gimpo International handles domestic flights along with some short haul international flights to Tokyo Haneda, Osaka Kansai, Taipei Songshan, Shanghai Hongqiao, and Beijing Capital although flights to Osaka Kansai and Beijing Capital also operate from Incheon International.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon International Airport opened in March 2001 in Yeongjong island. It is now responsible for major international flights. Incheon International Airport is Asia's eighth busiest airport in terms of passengers, the world's fourth busiest airport by cargo traffic, and the world's eighth busiest airport in terms of international passengers in 2014. In 2016, 57,765,397 passengers used the airport. Incheon International Airport opened terminal 2 on 18 January 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon and Gimpo are linked to Seoul by expressway, and to each other by the AREX to Seoul Station. Intercity bus services are available to various destinations around the country.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nCycling is becoming increasingly popular in Seoul and in the entire country. Both banks of the Han River have cycling paths that run all the way across the city along the river. In addition, Seoul introduced in 2015 a bicycle-sharing system named Ddareungi (and named Seoul Bike in English).[136]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in South Korea and List of universities in Seoul\n\n### Universities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of Seoul National University\nSeoul is home to the majority of South Korea's most prestigious universities, including Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Korea University.\n\n\nSeoul ranked 2nd on the QS Best Student Cities 2023.[137]\n\n\n\n### Secondary education[edit]\n\n\nCompulsory education lasts from grade 1–9 (six years of elementary school and 3 years of middle school).[138] Students spend six years in elementary school, three years in middle school, and three years in high school. Secondary schools generally require students to wear uniforms. There is an exit exam for graduating from high school and many students proceeding to the university level are required to take the College Scholastic Ability Test that is held every November. Although there is a test for non-high school graduates, called school qualification exam, most Koreans take the test.\n\n\nSeoul is home to various specialized schools, including three science high schools, and six foreign language High Schools. Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education comprises 235 College-Preparatory High Schools, 80 Vocational Schools, 377 Middle Schools, and 33 Special Education Schools as of 2009[update].\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of diplomatic missions in South Korea\n\nSeoul is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.

The city stands on the Moskva River in Central Russia, with a population estimated at 13.0 million residents within the city limits,[6] over 18.8 million residents in the urban area,[7] and over 21.5 million residents in the metropolitan area.[14] The city covers an area of 2,511 square kilometers (970 sq mi), while the urban area covers 5,891 square kilometers (2,275 sq mi),[7] and the metropolitan area covers over 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 sq mi).[14] Moscow is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city entirely in Europe, the largest urban and metropolitan area in Europe,[7][14] and the largest city by land area on the European continent.[15]\n\n\nFirst documented in 1147, Moscow grew to become a prosperous and powerful city that served as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. When the Tsardom of Russia was proclaimed, Moscow remained the political and economic center for most of its history. Under the reign of Peter the Great, the Russian capital was moved to the newly founded city of Saint Petersburg in 1712, diminishing Moscow's influence. Following the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Russian SFSR, the capital was moved back to Moscow in 1918, where it later became the political center of the Soviet Union.[16] In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moscow remained the capital city of the newly established Russian Federation.\n\n\nThe northernmost and coldest megacity in the world, Moscow is governed as a federal city,[17] where it serves as the political, economic, cultural, and scientific center of Russia and Eastern Europe. As an alpha world city,[18] Moscow has one of the world's largest urban economies.[19] The city is one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the world,[20] and is one of Europe's most visited cities. Moscow is home to the sixth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[21] The Moscow International Business Center is one of the largest financial centers in Europe and the world, and features the majority of Europe's tallest skyscrapers. Moscow was the host city of the 1980 Summer Olympics, and one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[22]\n\n\nAs the historic core of Russia, Moscow serves as the home of numerous Russian artists, scientists, and sports figures due to the presence of its various museums, academic and political institutions, and theaters. The city is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is well known for its display of Russian architecture, particularly its historic Red Square, and buildings such as the Saint Basil's Cathedral and the Moscow Kremlin, of which the latter serves as the seat of power of the Government of Russia. Moscow is home to many Russian companies in numerous industries and is served by a comprehensive transit network, which includes four international airports, ten railway terminals, a tram system, a monorail system, and most notably the Moscow Metro, the busiest metro system in Europe, and one of the largest rapid transit systems in the world. The city has over 40 percent of its territory covered by greenery, making it one of the greenest cities in the world.[15][23]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the Moskva River.[24][25] Several theories of the origin of the name of the river have been proposed. Finno-Ugric Merya and Muroma people, who were among the several pre-Slavic tribes which originally inhabited the area, called the river supposedly *Mustajoki*, in English: *Black river*. It has been suggested that the name of the city derives from this term.[26][27]\n\n\nThe most linguistically well-grounded and widely accepted is from the Proto-Balto-Slavic root \\**mŭzg*-/*muzg*- from the Proto-Indo-European \\**meu*- \"wet\",[25][28][29] so the name *Moskva* might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh.[24] Its cognates include Russian: музга, *muzga* \"pool, puddle\", Lithuanian: *mazgoti* and Latvian: *mazgāt* \"to wash\", Sanskrit: májjati \"to drown\", Latin: *mergō* \"to dip, immerse\".[24][28] In many Slavic countries Moskov is a surname, most common in Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and North Macedonia.[30] Additionally, there are similarly named places in Poland like Mozgawa.[24][25][28]\n\n\nThe original Old Russian form of the name is reconstructed as \\*Москы, \\**Mosky*,[24][25] hence it was one of a few Slavic *ū*-stem nouns. As with other nouns of that declension, it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language, as a result, the first written mentions in the 12th century were Московь, *Moskovĭ* (accusative case), Москви, *Moskvi* (locative case), Москвe/Москвѣ, *Moskve/Moskvě* (genitive case).[24][25] From the latter forms came to the modern Russian name Москва, *Moskva*, which is a result of morphological generalization with the numerous Slavic *ā*-stem nouns.\n\n\nHowever, the form *Moskovĭ* has left some traces in many other languages, including English: Moscow, German: *Moskau*, French: *Moscou*, Georgian: მოსკოვი, Latvian: *Maskava*, Bashkir: Мәскәү, Tatar: *Mäskäw*, Portuguese: *Moscovo*, Chuvash: Мускав, and Spanish: *Moscú*. \n\n\nIn a similar manner the Latin name *Moscovia* has been formed, later it became a colloquial name for Russia used in Western Europe in the 16th–17th centuries. From it as well came English *Muscovy* and *muscovite*.[31][*failed verification*]\n\n\nVarious other theories (of Celtic, Iranian, Caucasic origins), having little or no scientific ground, are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists.[24][25]\n\n\n\n### Other names[edit]\n\n\nMoscow has acquired several epithets, most referring to its size and preeminent status within the nation: The *Third Rome* (Третий Рим), the *Whitestone One* (Белокаменная), the *First Throne* (Первопрестольная), the *Forty Soroks* (Сорок Сороков) (\"sorok\" meaning both \"forty, a great many\" and \"a district or parish\" in Old Russian). Moscow is also one of the twelve Hero Cities. The demonym for a Moscow resident is \"москвич\" (*moskvich*) for male or \"москвичка\" (*moskvichka*) for female, rendered in English as *Muscovite*. The name \"Moscow\" is abbreviated \"MSK\" (МСК in Russian).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Moscow\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Moscow.\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nArchaeological digs show that the site of today's Moscow and the surrounding area have been inhabited since time immemorial. Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture, which experts assign to the Neolithic period, the last phase of the Stone Age.[32]\n\n\nThey confirm that the first inhabitants of the area were hunters and gatherers. Around 950 AD, two Slavic tribes, Vyatichi and Krivichi, settled here. Possibly the Vyatichi formed the core of Moscow's indigenous population.[33]\n\n\n\n### Early history (1147–1284)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Kievan Rus' and Vladimir-Suzdal\n\n![](image)Vladimir-Suzdal, a principality on the northeastern periphery of Kievan Rus', grew into the Grand Duchy of Moscow.\nThe first known reference to Moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of Yuri Dolgoruky and Sviatoslav Olgovich. At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. The chronicle says, \"Come, my brother, to Moskov\" (Приди ко мне, брате, в Москов).[34]\n\n\nIn 1156, Knyaz Yuri Dolgorukiy fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat. In the course of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus', the Mongols under Batu Khan burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe timber fort *na Moskvě* \"on the Moscow River\" was inherited by Daniel, the youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, in the 1260s, at the time considered the least valuable of his father's possessions.\nDaniel was still a child at the time, and the big fort was governed by *tiuns* (deputies), appointed by Daniel's paternal uncle, Yaroslav of Tver.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDaniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success, siding with his brother Dmitry in his bid for the rule of Novgorod. From 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside Dmitry, who became Grand Duke of Vladimir.\nDaniel has been credited with founding the first Moscow monasteries, dedicated to the Lord's Epiphany and to Saint Daniel.[35]\n\n\n\n### Grand Duchy (1283–1547)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grand Duchy of Moscow\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| The Moscow Kremlin in the late 16th century\n | The 1382 siege of Moscow | Red Square |\n\n\nDaniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city that would eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s.\n\n\nOn the right bank of the Moskva River, at a distance of eight kilometres (5 mi) from the Kremlin, not later than in 1282, Daniel founded the first monastery with the wooden church of St. Daniel-Stylite, which is now the Danilov Monastery. Daniel died in 1303, at the age of 42. Before his death, he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery.\n\n\nMoscow was quite stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large number of refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing primogeniture, whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons, rather than dividing it up among all sons. By 1304, Yury of Moscow contested with Mikhail of Tver for the throne of the principality of Vladimir. Ivan I eventually defeated Tver to become the sole collector of taxes for the Mongol rulers, making Moscow the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the Khan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Spassky Cathedral (Moscow's oldest extant building), built c. 1357\nWhile the Khan of the Golden Horde initially attempted to limit Moscow's influence, when the growth of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania began to threaten all of Russia, the Khan strengthened Moscow to counterbalance Lithuania, allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in Russia. In 1380, prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Mongols in the Battle of Kulikovo. Afterward, Moscow took the leading role in liberating Russia from Mongol domination. In 1480, Ivan III had finally broken the Russians free from Tatar control, and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of Russia and Siberia, and parts of many other lands.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Spasskaya Tower, built in 1491\nIn 1462 Ivan III, (1440–1505) became Grand Prince of Moscow (then part of the medieval Muscovy state). He began fighting the Tatars, enlarged the territory of Muscovy, and enriched his capital city. By 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest cities in the world. He conquered the far larger principality of Novgorod to the north, which had been allied to the hostile Lithuanians. Thus he enlarged the territory sevenfold, from 430,000 to 2,800,000 square kilometres (170,000 to 1,080,000 square miles). He took control of the ancient \"Novgorod Chronicle\" and made it a propaganda vehicle for his regime.[36][37]\n\n\nThe original Moscow Kremlin was built in the 14th century. It was reconstructed by Ivan, who in the 1480s invited architects from Renaissance Italy, such as Petrus Antonius Solarius, who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and Marco Ruffo who designed the new palace for the prince. The Kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by Solarius, completed in 1495. The Kremlin's Great Bell Tower was built in 1505–08 and augmented to its present height in 1600.\n\n\nA trading settlement, or *posad*, grew up to the east of the Kremlin, in the area known as *Zaradye* (Зарядье). In the time of Ivan III, the Red Square, originally named the Hollow Field (Полое поле) appeared.\n\n\nIn 1508–1516, the Italian architect Aleviz Fryazin (Novy) arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall, which would connect the Moskva and Neglinnaya and be filled in with water from Neglinnaya. This moat, known as the Alevizov moat and having a length of 541 metres (1,775 feet), width of 36 metres (118 feet), and a depth of 9.5 to 13 metres (31–43 feet) was lined with limestone and, in 1533, fenced on both sides with low, four-metre-thick (13-foot) cogged-brick walls.\n\n\n\n### Tsardom (1547–1721)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Tsardom of Russia\n\n![](image)Saint Basil's Cathedral, built in 1561\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the three circular defenses were built: Kitay-gorod (Китай-город), the White City (Белый город) and the Earthen City (Земляной город). However, in 1547, two fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the Crimean Tatars captured Moscow, burning everything except the Kremlin.[38] The annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived.\n\n\n\n![](image)View of 17th-century Moscow (1922 drawing by Apollinary Vasnetsov)\nThe Crimean Tatars attacked again in 1591, but this time were held back by new defense walls, built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named Fyodor Kon. In 1592, an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city, including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River. As an outermost line of defense, a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east, principally the Novodevichy Convent and Donskoy, Danilov, Simonov, Novospasskiy, and Andronikov monasteries, most of which now house museums. From its ramparts, the city became poetically known as *Bielokamennaya*, the \"White-Walled.\" The city's limits as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the Garden Ring.\n\n\nThree square gates existed on the eastern side of the Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Saviour and St. Nicholas that hung over them). The last two were directly opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral.\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Sigismundian\" Plan of Moscow (1610), named after Sigismund III of Poland, is the last city plan compiled before the destruction of the city in 1612 by retreating Polish troops and subsequent changes to the street network. Orientation: north is at the right, west at the top.\nThe Russian famine of 1601–03 killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow. From 1610 through 1612, troops of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied Moscow, as its ruler Sigismund III tried to take the Russian throne. In 1612, the people of Nizhny Novgorod and other Russian cities conducted by prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin rose against the Polish occupants, besieged the Kremlin, and expelled them. In 1613, the Zemsky sobor elected Michael Romanov tsar, establishing the Romanov dynasty. The 17th century was rich in popular risings, such as the liberation of Moscow from the Polish–Lithuanian invaders (1612), the Salt Riot (1648), the Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising of 1682.\n\n\nDuring the first half of the 17th century, the population of Moscow doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000. It expanded beyond its ramparts in the later 17th century. It is estimated, that in the middle of the 17th century, 20% of Moscow suburb's inhabitants were from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, practically all of them being driven from their homeland to Moscow by Muscovite invaders.[39] By 1682, there were 692 households established north of the ramparts, by Ukrainians and Belarusians abducted from their hometowns in the course of the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). These new outskirts of the city came to be known as the *Meshchanskaya sloboda*, after Ruthenian *meshchane* \"town people\". The term *meshchane* (мещане) acquired pejorative connotations in 18th-century Russia and today means \"petty bourgeois\" or \"narrow-minded philistine\".[40]\n\n\nThe entire city of the late 17th century, including the slobodas that grew up outside the city ramparts, are contained within what is today Moscow's Central Administrative Okrug.\n\n\nNumerous disasters befell the city. The plague epidemics ravaged Moscow in 1570–1571, 1592 and 1654–1656.[41] The plague killed upwards of 80% of the people in 1654–55. Fires burned out much of the wooden city in 1626 and 1648.[42] In 1712 Peter the Great moved his government to the newly built Saint Petersburg on the Baltic coast. Moscow ceased to be Russia's capital, except for a brief period from 1728 to 1732 under the influence of the Supreme Privy Council.\n\n\n\n### Empire (1721–1917)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Governorate\n\nFurther information: Russian Empire\n\n![Panorama of Moscow in 1819-1823](image)\nA panoramic view of Moscow from the Spasskaya Tower in 1819–1823\n\n![](image)Moskva riverfront in the 19th century\nAfter losing the status as the capital of the empire, the population of Moscow at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750. But after 1750, the population grew more than tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915. The 1770–1772 Russian plague killed up to 100,000 people in Moscow.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bookshops at the Novospassky Bridge in the 17th century, by Apollinary Vasnetsov\nBy 1700, the building of cobbled roads had begun. In November 1730, the permanent street light was introduced, and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight. In 1883, near the Prechistinskiye Gates, arc lamps were installed. In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade 40 kilometres (25 mi) long, the Kamer-Kollezhskiy barrier, with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected. Its line is traced today by a number of streets called *val* (\"ramparts\").\nBetween 1781 and 1804 the Mytischinskiy water pipe (the first in Russia) was built. In 1813, following the destruction of much of the city during the French occupation, a Commission for the Construction of the City of Moscow was established. It launched a great program of rebuilding, including a partial replanning of the city-centre. Among many buildings constructed or reconstructed at this time was the Grand Kremlin Palace and the Kremlin Armoury, the Moscow University, the Moscow Manege (Riding School), and the Bolshoi Theatre. In 1903 the Moskvoretskaya water supply was completed.\n\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances. From this gate, wooden and (following the 17th-century improvements) stone bridges stretched across the moat. Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns – \"raskats\". The Tsar Cannon was located on the platform of the Lobnoye mesto.\n\n\nThe road connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg, now the M10 highway, was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old Tver road, which had existed since the 16th century. It became known as *Peterburskoye Schosse* after it was paved in the 1780s. Petrovsky Palace was built in 1776–1780 by Matvey Kazakov.\n\n\n\n![](image)Napoleon retreating from the city during the Fire of Moscow, after the failed French Invasion of Russia\nWhen Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, the Moscovites were evacuated. It is suspected that the Moscow fire was principally the effect of Russian sabotage. Napoleon's *Grande Armée* was forced to retreat and was nearly annihilated by the devastating Russian winter and sporadic attacks by Russian military forces. As many as 400,000 of Napoleon's soldiers died during this time.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cathedral Square during the coronation of Alexander I, 1802, by Fyodor Alekseyev\nMoscow State University was established in 1755. Its main building was reconstructed after the 1812 fire by Domenico Giliardi. The *Moskovskiye Vedomosti* newspaper appeared from 1756, originally in weekly intervals, and from 1859 as a daily newspaper.\n\n\nThe Arbat Street had been in existence since at least the 15th century, but it was developed into a prestigious area during the 18th century. It was destroyed in the fire of 1812 and was rebuilt completely in the early 19th century.\n\n\nIn the 1830s, general Alexander Bashilov planned the first regular grid of city streets north from Petrovsky Palace. Khodynka field south of the highway was used for military training. Smolensky Rail station (forerunner of present-day Belorussky Rail Terminal) was inaugurated in 1870. Sokolniki Park, in the 18th century the home of the tsar's falconers well outside Moscow, became contiguous with the expanding city in the later 19th century and was developed into a public municipal park in 1878. The suburban Savyolovsky Rail Terminal was built in 1902. In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or Mayor, was officially introduced in Moscow, and Alexander Adrianov became Moscow's first official mayor.\n\n\nWhen Catherine II came to power in 1762, the city's filth and the smell of sewage were depicted by observers as a symptom of disorderly lifestyles of lower-class Russians recently arrived from the farms. Elites called for improving sanitation, which became part of Catherine's plans for increasing control over social life. National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society. There was less talk about the smell and the poor conditions of public health. However, in the wake of Russia's failures in the Crimean War in 1855–56, confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded, and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda.[45]\n\n\n\n### Soviet period (1917–1991)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City plan of Moscow, 1917\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Song from the Soviet film |\n\n\nIn November 1917, upon learning of the uprising happening in Petrograd, Moscow's Bolsheviks also began their uprising. On November 2 (15), 1917, after heavy fighting, Soviet power was established in Moscow.[46]\n\n\nThen Vladimir Lenin, fearing possible foreign invasion, moved the capital from Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) back to Moscow on March 12, 1918.[47] The Kremlin once again became the seat of power and the political centre of the new state.\n\n\nWith the change in values imposed by communist ideology, the tradition of preservation of cultural heritage was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with the collectivization of peasants; the destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. In 1937 several letters were written to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to rename Moscow to \"Stalindar\" or \"Stalinodar,\" one from an elderly pensioner whose dream was to \"live in Stalinodar\" and had selected the name to represent the \"gift\" (dar) of the genius of Stalin.[48] Stalin rejected this suggestion, and after it was suggested again to him by Nikolai Yezhov, he was outraged, saying \"What do I need this for?\". This was following Stalin banning the renaming of places in his name in 1936.[49]\n\n\nDuring World War II, the Soviet State Committee of Defence and the General Staff of the Red Army were located in Moscow. In 1941, 16 divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), 25 battalions (18,000 people), and four engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. Between October 1941 and January 1942, the German Army Group Centre was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the Battle of Moscow. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from October 20 the city was declared to be in a state of siege. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses, while the city was bombarded from the air. On May 1, 1944, a medal \"For the defence of Moscow\" and in 1947 another medal \"In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow\" was instituted.\n\n\nBoth German and Soviet casualties during the Battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Total casualties between September 30, 1941, and January 7, 1942, are estimated to be between 248,000 and 400,000 for the Wehrmacht and between 650,000 and 1,280,000 for the Red Army.[50][51][52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Funeral procession at the funeral of Joseph Stalin, 1953\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Stalins USSR in 1953 |\n\n\nDuring the postwar years, there was a serious housing crisis, solved by the invention of high-rise apartments. There are over 11,000 of these standardised and prefabricated apartment blocks, housing the majority of Moscow's population, making it by far the city with the most high-rise buildings.[53] Apartments were built and partly furnished in the factory before being raised and stacked into tall columns. The popular Soviet-era comic film *Irony of Fate* parodies this construction method.\n\n\nThe city of Zelenograd was built in 1958 at 37 kilometres (23 miles) from the city centre to the north-west, along with the Leningradskoye Shosse, and incorporated as one of Moscow's administrative okrugs. Moscow State University moved to its campus on Sparrow Hills in 1953.\n\n\nIn 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign. By 1964 over 10 thousand churches out of 20 thousand were shut down (mostly in rural areas) and many were demolished. Of 58 monasteries and convents operating in 1959, only sixteen remained by 1964; of Moscow's fifty churches operating in 1959, thirty were closed and six demolished.\n\n\n\n![](image)Soviet parade outside Hotel Moskva on the Manezhnaya Square, 1964\nOn May 8, 1965, due to the actual 20th anniversary of the victory in World War II, Moscow was awarded a title of the Hero City.\n\n\n\n![](image)Victory Day celebration on Red Square, May 9, 1975\nThe Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) was opened in 1961. It had four lanes running 109 kilometres (68 miles) along the city borders. The MKAD marked the administrative boundaries of the city of Moscow until the 1980s when outlying suburbs beyond the ring road began to be incorporated. In 1980, Moscow hosted the Summer Olympic Games, which were boycotted by the United States and several other Western countries due to the Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan in late 1979. In 1991 Moscow was the scene of a coup attempt by conservative communists opposed to the liberal reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\n\n\n### Recent history (1991–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Floating bridge in Zaryadye Park, with the Red Square and the Moscow Kremlin in the distance\n![](image)Tverskaya Street, the main radial street in the city\nWhen the USSR was dissolved in the same year, Moscow remained the capital of the Russian SFSR (on December 25, 1991, the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation). Since then, a market economy has emerged in Moscow, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles.\n\n\nThe city has continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million. Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls (before 1991) produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935. Since then, however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments. In 1995–1997 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes.\n\n\nIn December 2002 Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD. The Third Ring Road, intermediate between the early 19th-century Garden Ring and the Soviet-era outer ring road, was completed in 2004. The greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented, and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe. Summer dachas are being converted into year-round residences, and with the proliferation of automobiles there is heavy traffic congestion.[54] Multiple old churches and other examples of architectural heritage that had been demolished during the Stalin era have been restored, such as the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.\nIn 2010s Moscow's Administration has launched some long duration projects like the *Moja Ulitsa* (in English: *My Street*) urban redevelopment program[55] or the Residency renovation one.[56]\n\n\nBy its territorial expansion on July 1, 2012, southwest into the Moscow Oblast the area of the capital more than doubled, going from 1,091 to 2,511 square kilometers (421 to 970 sq mi), resulting in Moscow becoming the largest city on the European continent by area; it also gained an additional population of 233,000 people.[57][58] The annexed territory was officially named *Новая Москва* (New Moscow).\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Moscow and its nearby suburbs\nMoscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River, which flows for just over 500 km (311 mi) through the East European Plain in central Russia, not far from the natural border of the forest and forest-steppe zone. 49 bridges span the river and its canals within the city's limits. The elevation of Moscow at the All-Russia Exhibition Center (VVC), where the leading Moscow weather station is situated, is 156 metres (512 feet). Teplostan Upland is the city's highest point at 255 metres (837 feet).[59] The width of Moscow city (not limiting MKAD) from west to east is 39.7 km (24.7 mi), and the length from north to south is 51.8 km (32.2 mi).\n\n\n\n### Time[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Time\n\nMoscow serves as the reference point for the time zone used in most of European Russia, Belarus and the Republic of Crimea. The areas operate in what is referred to in international standards as *Moscow Standard Time (MSK, МСК)*, which is 3 hours ahead of UTC, or UTC+3. Daylight saving time is no longer observed. According to the geographical longitude the average solar noon in Moscow occurs at 12:30.[60]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Moscow\n\n![](image)VDNKh after rain\nMoscow has a humid continental climate (Köppen: *Dfb*) with long, cold (although average by Russian standards) winters usually lasting from mid-November to the end of March, and warm summers. More extreme continental climates at the same latitude- such as parts of Eastern Canada or Siberia- have much colder winters than Moscow, suggesting that there is still significant moderation from the Atlantic Ocean despite the fact that Moscow is far from the sea. Weather can fluctuate widely, with temperatures ranging from −25 °C (−13 °F) in the city and −30 °C (−22 °F) in the suburbs to above 5 °C (41 °F) in the winter, and from 10 to 35 °C (50 to 95 °F) in the summer.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Petrovsky Palace on Leningradsky Avenue in winter\nTypical high temperatures in the warm months of June, July, and August are around a comfortable 20 to 26 °C (68 to 79 °F), but during heat waves (which can occur between May and September), daytime high temperatures often exceed 30 °C (86 °F), sometimes for a week or two at a time. In the winter, average temperatures normally drop to approximately −10 °C (14 °F), though almost every winter there are periods of warmth with day temperatures rising above 0 °C (32 °F), and periods of cooling with night temperatures falling below −20 °C (−4 °F). These periods usually last about a week or two. The growing season in Moscow normally lasts for 156 days usually around May 1 to October 5.[62]\n\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded was 38.2 °C (100.8 °F)[63] at the VVC weather station and 39.0 °C (102.2 °F) in the center of Moscow and Domodedovo airport on July 29, 2010, during the unusual 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves. Record high and average temperatures were recorded for January, March, April, May, June, July, August, November, and December in 2007–2022.[64] The average July temperature from 1991 to 2020 is 19.7 °C (67.5 °F). The lowest ever recorded temperature was −42.1 °C (−43.8 °F) in January 1940. Snow, which is present for about five months a year, often begins to fall mid-October, while snow cover lies in November and melts at the beginning of April.\n\n\nOn average, Moscow has 1731 hours of sunshine per year, varying from a low of 8% in December to 52% from May to August.[65] This large annual variation is due to convective cloud formation. In the winter, moist air from the Atlantic condenses in the cold continental interior, resulting in very overcast conditions. However, this same continental influence results in considerably sunnier summers than oceanic cities of similar latitude such as Edinburgh. Between 2004 and 2010, the average was between 1800 and 2000 hours with a tendency to more sunshine in summer months, up to a record 411 hours in July 2014, 79% of possible sunshine. December 2017 was the darkest month in Moscow since records began, with only six minutes of sunlight.[66][67]\n\n\nTemperatures in the centre of Moscow are often significantly higher than in the outskirts and nearby suburbs, especially in winter. For example, if the average February temperature in the north-east of Moscow is −6.7 °C (19.9 °F), in the suburbs it is about −9 °C (16 °F).[68] The temperature difference between the centre of Moscow and nearby areas of Moscow Oblast can sometimes be more than 10 °C (18 °F) on frosty winter nights.\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Moscow (VVC) normals 1991–2020, records 1879–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 28.9(84.0)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −3.9(25.0)\n | −3(27)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 19.0(66.2)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −6.2(20.8)\n | −5.9(21.4)\n | −0.7(30.7)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −4.4(24.1)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −8.7(16.3)\n | −8.8(16.2)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 8.1(46.6)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | −2.4(27.7)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | 2.6(36.7)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −42.1(−43.8)\n | −38.2(−36.8)\n | −32.4(−26.3)\n | −21(−6)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | −8.5(16.7)\n | −20.3(−4.5)\n | −32.8(−27.0)\n | −38.8(−37.8)\n | −42.1(−43.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 44(1.7)\n | 39(1.5)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 61(2.4)\n | 78(3.1)\n | 84(3.3)\n | 78(3.1)\n | 66(2.6)\n | 70(2.8)\n | 52(2.0)\n | 51(2.0)\n | 713(28.1)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth cm (inches)\n | 24(9.4)\n | 35(14)\n | 29(11)\n | 2(0.8)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 12(4.7)\n | 35(14)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 8\n | 6\n | 9\n | 15\n | 16\n | 16\n | 15\n | 16\n | 16\n | 17\n | 13\n | 8\n | 155\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 25\n | 23\n | 15\n | 6\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0.3\n | 5\n | 17\n | 24\n | 116\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 85\n | 81\n | 74\n | 68\n | 67\n | 72\n | 74\n | 78\n | 82\n | 83\n | 86\n | 86\n | 78\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 33\n | 72\n | 128\n | 170\n | 265\n | 279\n | 271\n | 238\n | 147\n | 78\n | 32\n | 18\n | 1,731\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 14\n | 27\n | 35\n | 40\n | 53\n | 53\n | 52\n | 51\n | 38\n | 24\n | 13\n | 8\n | 34\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 3\n |\n| Source 1: Pogoda.ru.net,[69][70] Thermograph.ru,[71] Meteoweb.ru (sunshine hours)[72] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[73] |\n\n| Climate data for Moscow (VVC) normals 1961–1990\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −6.3(20.7)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 1.5(34.7)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 1.1(34.0)\n | −3.5(25.7)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −9.3(15.3)\n | −7.7(18.1)\n | −2.2(28.0)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | −6.1(21.0)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −12.3(9.9)\n | −11.1(12.0)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | 1.7(35.1)\n | 7.6(45.7)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 7.1(44.8)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | −3.3(26.1)\n | −8.6(16.5)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n |\n| Source: [74][75][76][77] |\n\nRecent changes in Moscow's regional climate, since it is in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, are often cited by climate scientists as evidence of global warming[*citation needed*], though by definition, climate change is global, not regional. During the summer, extreme heat is often observed in the city (2001, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2011, 2021). Along with a southern part of Central Russia,[78][79] after recent years of hot summer seasons, the climate of the city gets hot-summer classification trends. Winter also became significantly milder: for example, the average January temperature in the early 1900s was −12.0 °C (10.4 °F), while now it is about −7.0 °C (19.4 °F).[80] At the end of January–February it is often colder, with frosts reaching −30.0 °C (−22.0 °F) a few nights per year (2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013).\n\n\nThe last decade was the warmest in the history of meteorological observations of Moscow.

According to Russia's Federal Migration Service, Moscow holds 1.8 million official \"guests\" who have temporary residency on the basis of visas or other documentation, giving a legal population of 14.8 million. The number of Illegal immigrants, the vast majority originating from Central Asia, is estimated to be an additional 1 million people,[92] giving a total population of about 15.8 million.\n\n\n**Vital statistics for 2022:**[93][94]\n\n\n\n* Births: 123,654 (9.8 per 1,000)\n* Deaths: 126,988 (10.1 per 1,000)\n\n\n**Total fertility rate (2022):**[95]   \n\n1.42 children per woman\n\n\n**Life expectancy (2021):**[96]   \n\nTotal — 74.55 years (male — 71.00, female — 77.94)\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in Moscow (2020)[97][98] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Russian Orthodoxy |  | 55% |\n| Atheism and irreligion |  | 28% |\n| Islam |  | 8% |\n| Other religions |  | 3% |\n| Other Christians |  | 2% |\n| Undeclared |  | 4% |\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from left**: the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, demolished during the Soviet period and reconstructed from 1990–2000; Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception; Moscow Cathedral Mosque; and Moscow Choral Synagogue\n\nChristians form the majority of the city's population; most of whom adhere Russian Orthodox Church. The Patriarch of Moscow serves as the head of the church and resides in the Danilov Monastery. Moscow was called the \"city of 40 times 40 churches\"—prior to 1917. Moscow is Russia's capital of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which has been the country's traditional religion.\n\n\nOther religions practiced in Moscow include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Yazidism, and Rodnovery. The Moscow Mufti Council claimed that Muslims numbered around 1.5 million of 10.5 million of the city's population in 2010;[99] There are four mosques in the city.[100]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Moscow\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, a masterpiece of Russian architecture\n![](image)The State Historical Museum, an example of the Neo-Russian style\n![](image)The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, an example of Neo-Byzantine architecture\nMoscow's architecture is world-renowned. Moscow is the site of Saint Basil's Cathedral, with its elegant onion domes, as well as the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the Seven Sisters. The first Kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century.\n\n\nMedieval Moscow's design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares. This layout, as well as Moscow's rivers, helped shape Moscow's design in subsequent centuries.\n\n\nThe Kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century. Its towers and some of its churches were built by Italian architects, lending the city some of the aurae of the renaissance. From the end of the 15th century, the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries, palaces, walls, towers, and churches.\n\n\nThe city's appearance had not changed much by the 18th century. Houses were made of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark. The rebuilding of Moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated by constant fires and the needs of the nobility. Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.[101]\n\n\nFor much of its architectural history, Moscow was dominated by Orthodox churches. However, the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during Soviet times, especially as a result of Joseph Stalin's large-scale effort to \"modernize\" Moscow. Stalin's plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways, some of them over ten lanes wide, which, while greatly simplifying movement through the city, were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts. Among the many casualties of Stalin's demolitions was the Sukharev Tower, a longtime city landmark, as well as mansions and commercial buildings. The city's newfound status as the capital of a deeply secular nation, made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition. Many of the city's churches, which in most cases were some of Moscow's oldest and most prominent buildings, were destroyed; some notable examples include the Kazan Cathedral and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. During the 1990s, both were rebuilt. Many smaller churches, however, were lost.[102]\n\n\n\n![](image)GUM department store, facing the Red Square\n![](image)Ostankino Tower, the tallest freestanding structure in Europe, and the eighth-tallest in the world\nWhile the later Stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation, the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city. Especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with VKHUTEMAS, responsible for such landmarks as Lenin's Mausoleum. Another prominent architect was Vladimir Shukhov, famous for Shukhov Tower, just one of many hyperboloid towers designed by Shukhov. It was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a Russian broadcasting company.[103] Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the Constructivist architecture of early Soviet Russia. He designed spacious elongated shop galleries, most notably the GUM department store on Red Square,[103] bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults.\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the Seven Sisters, Hotel Ukraina, is the tallest hotel in Europe, and one of the tallest hotels in the world.\n![](image)Zhivopisny Bridge, the highest cable-stayed bridge in Europe\nPerhaps the most recognizable contributions of the Stalinist period are the so-called Seven Sisters, seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the Kremlin. A defining feature of Moscow's skyline, their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York City, and their style—with intricate exteriors and a large central spire—has been described as Stalinist Gothic architecture. All seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city; they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the Ostankino Tower, which, when it was completed in 1967, was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world's seventy-second tallest, ranking among buildings such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, Taipei 101 in Taiwan and the CN Tower in Toronto.[104]\n\n\nThe Soviet goal of providing housing for every family, and the rapid growth of Moscow's population, led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power (Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc.). They are usually badly maintained.\n\n\nAlthough the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s, more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall, and have elevators. It is estimated that Moscow has over twice as many elevators as New York City and four times as many as Chicago. Moslift, one of the city's major elevator operating companies, has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call, to release residents trapped in elevators.[105]\n\n\nStalinist-era buildings, mostly found in the central part of the city, are massive and usually ornamented with Socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes. However, small churches—almost always Eastern Orthodox– found across the city provide glimpses of its past. The Old Arbat Street, a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area, preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century. Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city (behind the Stalinist façades of Tverskaya Street, for example) are also examples of bourgeois architecture typical of Tsarist times. Ostankino Palace, Kuskovo, Uzkoye and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era, and some convents, and monasteries, both inside and outside the city, are open to Muscovites and tourists.\n\n\n\n![](image)Modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented in the city for the first time with the ambitious MIBC.\nAttempts are being made to restore many of the city's best-kept examples of pre-Soviet architecture. These restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless façades. There are a few examples of notable, early Soviet avant-garde work too, such as the house of the architect Konstantin Melnikov in the Arbat area. Many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity. Facadism is also widely practiced.[106] Later examples of interesting Soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-Modernist styles employed, such as with the Novy Arbat project, familiarly known as \"false teeth of Moscow\" and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central Moscow involved in the project.\n\n\n\n![](image)Borovitskaya square, Monument to Vladimir the Great and Pashkov House\nPlaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there. Frequently, the plaques are dedicated to Soviet celebrities not well known outside (or often, like with decorated generals and revolutionaries, now both inside) of Russia. There are also many \"museum houses\" of famous Russian writers, composers, and artists in the city.\n\n\nMoscow's skyline is quickly modernizing, with several new towers under construction.\nIn recent years, the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings. As much as a third of historic Moscow has been destroyed in the past few years[107] to make space for luxury apartments and hotels.[108] Other historical buildings, including such landmarks as the 1930 Moskva hotel and the 1913 department store Voyentorg, have been razed and reconstructed anew, with the inevitable loss of historical value. Critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws: in the last 12 years, more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down, several of those dating back to the 17th century.[109] Some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures, which include many works by architect Konstantin Melnikov[110] and Mayakovskaya metro station.\n\n\nSome organizations, such as Moscow Architecture Preservation Society[111] and Save Europe's Heritage,[112] are trying to draw the international public attention to these problems.[113]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Panoramic view of Moscow\n | Panoramic view of Moscow\n |\n\n\n### Parks and landmarks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Moscow tourist attractions\n\n![](image)\nRed Square is a World Heritage Site.\n\nThere are 96 parks and 18 gardens in Moscow, including four botanical gardens. There are 450 square kilometres (170 sq mi) of green zones besides 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi) of forests.[114] Moscow is a very green city, if compared to other cities of comparable size in Western Europe and North America; this is partly due to a history of having green \"yards\" with trees and grass, between residential buildings. There are on average 27 square meters (290 sq ft) of parks per person in Moscow compared with 6 for Paris, 7.5 in London and 8.6 in New York.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gorky Park\nGorky Park (officially the Central Park of Culture and Rest named after Maxim Gorky), was founded in 1928. The main part (689,000 square metres or 170 acres)[115] along the Moskva river contains estrades, children's attractions (including the *Observation Wheel* water ponds with boats and water bicycles), dancing, tennis courts and other sports facilities. It borders the Neskuchny Garden (408,000 square metres or 101 acres), the oldest park in Moscow and a former imperial residence, created as a result of the integration of three estates in the 18th century. The Garden features the Green Theater, one of the largest open amphitheaters in Europe, able to hold up to 15 thousand people.[116] Several parks include a section known as a \"Park of Culture and Rest\", sometimes alongside a much wilder area (this includes parks such as Izmaylovsky, Fili and Sokolniki). Some parks are designated as Forest Parks (lesopark).\n\n\n\n![](image)Dream Island, the largest indoor theme park in Europe\nIzmaylovsky Park, created in 1931, is one of the largest urban parks in the world along with Richmond Park in London. Its area of 15.34 square kilometres (5.92 sq mi) is six times greater than that of Central Park in New York.[115]\n\n\nBauman Garden, officially founded in 1920 and renamed in 1922 after the bolshevik Nikolay Bauman, is one of the oldest parks in Moscow. It is standing on the site of the former Golitsyn estate and eighteenth-century public garden.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Novodevichy Convent is a World Heritage Site. Sokolniki Park, named after the falcon hunting that occurred there in the past, is one of the oldest parks in Moscow and has an area of 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi). A central circle with a large fountain is surrounded by birch, maple, and elm tree alleys. A labyrinth composed of green paths lies beyond the park's ponds.\n\n\nLosiny Ostrov National Park (\"Elk Island\" National Park), with a total area of more than 116 square kilometres (45 sq mi), borders Sokolniki Park and was Russia's first national park. It is quite wild, and is also known as the \"city taiga\" – elk can be seen there.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Church of Ascension in Kolomenskoye is a World Heritage Site.\nTsytsin Main Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences, founded in 1945 is the largest in Europe.[118] It covers the territory of 3.61 square kilometres (1.39 sq mi) bordering the All-Russia Exhibition Center and contains a live exhibition of more than 20 thousand species of plants from around the world, as well as a lab for scientific research. It contains a rosarium with 20 thousand rose bushes, a dendrarium, and an oak forest, with the average age of trees exceeding 100 years. There is a greenhouse taking up more than 5,000 square metres (53,820 square feet) of land.[115]\n\n\nThe All-Russian Exhibition Center (Всероссийский выставочный центр), formerly known as the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV) and later Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (VDNKh), though officially named a \"permanent trade show\", is one of the most prominent examples of Stalinist-era monumental architecture. Among the large spans of a recreational park, areas are scores of elaborate pavilions, each representing either a branch of Soviet industry and science or a USSR republic. Even though during the 1990s it was, and for some part still is, misused as a gigantic shopping center (most of the pavilions are rented out for small businesses), it still retains the bulk of its architectural landmarks, including two monumental fountains (*Stone Flower* and *Friendship of Nations*) and a 360 degrees panoramic cinema. In 2014 the park returned to the name Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, and in the same year, huge renovation works had been started.[119]\n\n\n*Lilac Park*, founded in 1958, has a permanent sculpture display and a large rosarium. Moscow has always been a popular destination for tourists. Some of the more famous attractions include the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site, Moscow Kremlin and Red Square,[120] which was built between the 14th and 17th centuries.[121] The Church of the Ascension at Kolomenskoye, which dates from 1532, is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and another popular attraction.[122]\n\n\nNear the new Tretyakov Gallery there is a sculpture garden, Museon, often called \"the graveyard of fallen monuments\" that displays statues of the former Soviet Union that were removed from their place after its dissolution.\n\n\nOther attractions include the Moscow Zoo, a zoological garden in two sections (the valleys of two streams) linked by a bridge, with nearly a thousand species and more than 6,500 specimens.[123] Each year, the zoo attracts more than 1.2 million visitors.[123] Many of Moscow's parks and landscaped gardens are protected natural environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Zaryadye Park | VDNKh | Victory park on Poklonnaya Hill |\n\n\n## Moscow rings[edit]\n\n\nMoscow's road system is centered roughly on the Kremlin at the heart of the city. From there, roads generally span outwards to intersect with a sequence of circular roads (\"rings\").\n\n\n\n1. The first and innermost major ring, Bulvarnoye Koltso (Boulevard Ring), was built at the former location of the 16th-century city wall around what used to be called Bely Gorod (White Town).[124] The Bulvarnoye Koltso is technically not a ring; it does not form a complete circle, but instead a horseshoe-shaped arc that begins at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and ends at the Yauza River.\n2. The second primary ring, located outside the Boulevard Ring, is the Sadovoye Koltso (Garden Ring). Like the Boulevard Ring, the Garden Ring follows the path of a 16th-century wall that used to encompass part of Moscow.[124] ![](image)Moscow as viewed from the International Space Station, January 29, 2014\n3. The Third Ring Road, was completed in 2003 as a high-speed freeway.\n4. The Fourth Transport Ring, another freeway, was planned, but cancelled in 2011. A system of chordal highways will replace it.\n\n\nAside from the aforementioned hierarchy, line 5 of Moscow Metro is a circle-shaped looped subway line (hence the name *Koltsevaya Liniya*, literally \"ring line\"), which is located between the *Sadovoye Koltso* and Third Transport Ring.\n\n\nTwo modern overlapping lines of Moscow Metro form \"two hearts\":\n\n\n\n* Line 14. Since September 10, 2016, *Moscow Central Circle* renovated railroad (former *Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga*) was introduced as Line 14 of Moscow Metro. The cone-shaped railroad initially opened in 1908 (freight-only railway from 1934 until the 2016 reopening).\n* Line 11. Another circle metro line - *Big Circle Line* (*Bolshaya Koltsevaya Liniya*) is under construction and will be finished in 2023. Kakhovskaya-Savyolovskaya western half of the line was launched in late 2021.\n\n\nThe outermost ring within Moscow is the Moscow Ring Road (often called *MKAD*, acronym word for Russian *Московская Кольцевая Автомобильная Дорога*), which forms the cultural boundary of the city, and was established in the 1950s. It is to note the method of building the road (usage of ground elevation instead of concrete columns throughout the whole way) formed a wall-like barrier that obstacles building roads under the MKAD highway itself).\n\n\n\n* Before 2012 expansion of Moscow, MKAD was considered an approximate border for Moscow boundaries.\n\n\nOutside Moscow, some of the roads encompassing the city continue to follow this circular pattern seen inside city limits, with the notable examples of *Betonka* roads (highways A107 and A108), originally made of concrete pads.\n\n\nIn order to reduce transit traffic on MKAD, the new ring road (called *CKAD* - *Centralnaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga*, *Central Ring Road*) is now under construction beyond the MKAD.\n\n\n\n### Transport rings in Moscow[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Length\n | Name\n | Type\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 km | Boulevard Ring – Bulvarnoye Koltso (not a full ring) | Road\n |\n| 16 km | Garden Ring – Sadovoye Koltso (\"B\") | Road\n |\n| 19 km | Koltsevaya line (Line 5) | Metro\n |\n| 35 km | Third Ring Road – Third Transport Ring – Tretye Transportnoye Koltso (TTK) | Road\n |\n| 54 km | Little Ring of the Moscow Railway, re-opened as Moscow Central Ring (MCC) – Line 14 | Railway\n |\n| 20.2 km | Bolshaya Koltsevaya line – Line 11 | Metro\n |\n| 109 km | Moscow Automobile Ring Road – Moskovskaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga (MKAD) | Road\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Museums and galleries[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the Tretyakov Gallery, which was founded by Pavel Tretyakov, a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city.[125] The Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings. The Old Tretyakov gallery, the original gallery in the Tretyakovskaya area on the south bank of the Moskva River, houses works in the classic Russian tradition.[126] The works of famous pre-Revolutionary painters, such as Ilya Repin, as well as the works of early Russian icon painters can be found here. Visitors can even see rare originals by early 15th-century iconographer Andrei Rublev.[126]\nThe New Tretyakov gallery, created in Soviet times, mainly contains the works of Soviet artists, as well as of a few contemporary paintings, but there is some overlap with the Old Tretyakov Gallery for early 20th-century art. The new gallery includes a small reconstruction of Vladimir Tatlin's famous *Monument to the Third International* and a mixture of other avant-garde works by artists like Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky. Socialist realism features can also be found within the halls of the New Tretyakov Gallery.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts\nAnother art museum in the city of Moscow is the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, which was founded by, among others, the father of Marina Tsvetaeva. The Pushkin Museum is similar to the British Museum in London in that its halls are a cross-section of exhibits on world civilisations, with many copies of ancient sculptures. However, it also hosts paintings from every major Western era; works by Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, and Pablo Picasso are present in the museum's collection.\n\n\nThe State Historical Museum of Russia (Государственный Исторический музей) is a museum of Russian history located between Red Square and Manege Square in Moscow. Its exhibitions range from relics of the prehistoric tribes inhabiting present-day Russia, through priceless artworks acquired by members of the Romanov dynasty. The total number of objects in the museum's collection numbers is several million. The Polytechnical Museum,[127] founded in 1872 is the largest technical museum in Russia, offering a wide array of historical inventions and technological achievements, including humanoid automata from the 18th century and the first Soviet computers. Its collection contains more than 160,000 items.[128] The Borodino Panorama[129] museum located on Kutuzov Avenue provides an opportunity for visitors to experience being on a battlefield with a 360° diorama. It is a part of the large historical memorial commemorating the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 over Napoleon's army, that includes also the triumphal arch, erected in 1827. There is also a military history museum that includes statues, and military hardware.\nMemorial Museum of Cosmonautics under the Monument to the Conquerors of Space at the end of Cosmonauts Alley is the central memorial place for the Russian space officials.\n\n\nThe Shchusev State Museum of Architecture is the national museum of Russian architecture by the name of the architect Alexey Shchusev near the Kremlin area.\n\n\nMoscow will get its own branch of the Hermitage Museum in 2024, with authorities having agreed upon the final project, to be executed by Hani Rashid, co-founder of New York-based 'Asymptote Architecture' - the same bureau that's behind the city's stock market building, the Busan-based World Business Center Solomon Tower and the Strata Tower in Abu-Dhabi.[130]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Bolshoi Theatre\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMoscow is the heart of the Russian performing arts, including ballet and film, with 68 museums[131] 103[132] theaters, 132 cinemas and 24 concert halls. Among Moscow's theaters and ballet studios is the Bolshoi Theatre and the Malyi Theatre[133] as well as Vakhtangov Theatre and Moscow Art Theatre.\n\n\nThe Moscow International Performance Arts Center,[134] opened in 2003, also known as Moscow International House of Music, is known for its performances in classical music. It has the largest organ in Russia installed in Svetlanov Hall.\n\n\nThere are also two large circuses in Moscow: Moscow State Circus and Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard[135] named after Yuri Nikulin.\n\n\nThe Mosfilm studio was at the heart of many classic films, as it is responsible for both artistic and mainstream productions.[136] However, despite the continued presence and reputation of internationally renowned Russian filmmakers, the once prolific native studios are much quieter. Rare and historical films may be seen in the Salut cinema, where films from the Museum of Cinema[137] collection are shown regularly. International film festivals such as the Moscow International Film Festival, Stalker, Artdocfest, and Moscow Jewish Film Festival are staged in Moscow.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Football in Moscow\n\n![](image)The Luzhniki Stadium hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics and the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.\n![](image)Sparrow Hills fanzone during 2018 FIFA World Cup\n![](image)SC Olimpiyskiy was built for the 1980 Summer Olympics.\nOver 500 Olympic sports champions lived in the city by 2005.[138] Moscow is home to 63 stadiums (besides eight football and eleven light athletics maneges), of which Luzhniki Stadium is the largest and the 4th biggest in Europe (it hosted the 1998–99 UEFA Cup, 2007–08 UEFA Champions League finals, the 1980 Summer Olympics, and the 2018 FIFA World Cup with 7 games total, including the final). Forty other sports complexes are located within the city, including 24 with artificial ice. The Olympic Stadium was the world's first indoor arena for bandy and hosted the Bandy World Championship twice.[139] Moscow was again the host of the competition in 2010, this time in Krylatskoye.[140] That arena has also hosted the World Speed Skating Championships. There are also seven horse racing tracks in Moscow,[114] of which Central Moscow Hippodrome,[141] founded in 1834, is the largest.\n\n\n\n![](image)CSKA Arena during a game of KHL, considered to be the second-best ice hockey league in the world\nMoscow was the host city of the 1980 Summer Olympics, with the yachting events being held at Tallinn, in present-day Estonia. Large sports facilities and the main international airport, Sheremetyevo Terminal 2, were built in preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Moscow had made a bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. However, when final voting commenced on July 6, 2005, Moscow was the first city to be eliminated from further rounds. The Games were awarded to London.\n\n\nThe most titled ice hockey team in the Soviet Union and in the world, HC CSKA Moscow comes from Moscow. Other big ice hockey clubs from Moscow are HC Dynamo Moscow, which was the second most titled team in the Soviet Union, and HC Spartak Moscow.\n\n\nThe most titled Soviet, Russian, and one of the most titled Euroleague clubs, is the basketball club from Moscow PBC CSKA Moscow. Moscow hosted the EuroBasket in 1953 and 1965.\n\n\nMoscow had more winners at the USSR and Russian Chess Championship than any other city.\n\n\nThe most titled volleyball team in the Soviet Union and in Europe (CEV Champions League) is VC CSKA Moscow.\n\n\nIn football, FC Spartak Moscow has won more championship titles in the Russian Premier League than any other team. They were second only to FC Dynamo Kyiv in Soviet times. PFC CSKA Moscow became the first Russian football team to win a UEFA title, the UEFA Cup (present-day UEFA Europa League). FC Lokomotiv Moscow, FC Dynamo Moscow and FC Torpedo Moscow are other professional football teams also based in Moscow.\n\n\n\n* ![Otkrytiye Arena, home of FC Spartak Moscow](image)\n\nOtkrytiye Arena, home of FC Spartak Moscow\n* ![VEB Arena, home of PFC CSKA Moscow](image)\n\nVEB Arena, home of PFC CSKA Moscow\n* ![VTB Arena, home of FC Dynamo Moscow and HC Dynamo Moscow](image)\n\nVTB Arena, home of FC Dynamo Moscow and HC Dynamo Moscow\n* ![RZD Arena, home of FC Lokomotiv Moscow](image)\n\nRZD Arena, home of FC Lokomotiv Moscow\n\n\nMoscow houses other prominent football, ice hockey, and basketball teams. Because sports organisations in the Soviet Union were once highly centralized, two of the best Union-level teams represented defence and law-enforcing agencies: the Armed Forces (CSKA) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Dinamo). There were army and police teams in most major cities. As a result, Spartak, CSKA, and Dinamo were among the best-funded teams in the USSR.\n\n\nThe Irina Viner-Usmanova Gymnastics Palace is located in the Luzniki Olympic Complex. The building works started in 2017 and the opening ceremony took place on June 18, 2019. The investor of the Palace is the billionaire Alisher Usmanov, husband of the former gymnast and gymnastics coach Irina Viner-Usmanova. The total surface of the building is 23,500 m2, which include 3 fitness rooms, locker rooms, rooms reserved for referees and coaches, saunas, a canteen, a cafeteria, 2 ball halls, a Medical center, a hall reserved for journalists, and a hotel for athletes.[142]\n\n\nBecause of Moscow's cold local climate, winter sports have a following. Many of Moscow's large parks offer marked trails for skiing and frozen ponds for skating.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, which hosted games of the 2018 FIFA World Cup\nMoscow hosts the annual Kremlin Cup, a popular tennis tournament on both the WTA and ATP tours. It is one of the ten Tier-I events on the women's tour and a host of Russian players feature every year.\n\n\nSC Olimpiyskiy hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, the first and so far the only Eurovision Song Contest arranged in Russia.\n\n\nSlava Moscow is a professional rugby club, competing in the national Professional Rugby League. Former rugby league heavyweights RC Lokomotiv have entered the same league as of 2011[update]. The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens.\n\n\nIn bandy, one of the most successful clubs in the world is 20 times Russian League champions Dynamo Moscow. They have also won the World Cup thrice and European Cup six times.\n\n\nMFK Dinamo Moskva is one of the major futsal clubs in Europe, having won the Futsal Champions League title once.\n\n\nWhen Russia was selected to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the Luzhniki Stadium got an increased capacity, by almost 10,000 new seats, in addition to a further two stadiums that have been built: the Dynamo Stadium, and the Spartak Stadium, although the first one later was dismissed from having World Cup matches.\n\n\n\n### Football clubs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Club | Founded | League | League Rank | Stadium\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spartak Moscow | 1922 | Premier League | 1st | Otkrytiye Arena |\n| CSKA Moscow | 1911 | Premier League | 1st | VEB Arena |\n| Lokomotiv Moscow | 1923 | Premier League | 1st | RZD Arena |\n| Dynamo Moscow | 1923 | Premier League | 1st | VTB Arena |\n| Torpedo Moscow | 1924 | First League | 2nd | Eduard Streltsov Stadium |\n| Rodina Moscow | 2015 | First League | 2nd | Spartakovets Stadium\n |\n| Veles Moscow | 2016 | Second League | 3rd | Avangard Stadium\n |\n\n\n## Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of shopping malls in Moscow\n\n![](image)Arbat Street, in the historical centre of Moscow\nThe city is full of clubs, restaurants, and bars. Tverskaya Street is also one of the busiest shopping streets in Moscow.\n\n\nThe adjoining Tretyakovsky Proyezd, also south of Tverskaya Street, in Kitai-gorod, is host to upmarket boutique stores such as Bulgari, Tiffany & Co., Armani, Prada and Bentley.[143] Nightlife in Moscow has moved on since Soviet times and today the city has many of the world's largest nightclubs.[144] Clubs, bars, creative spaces and restaurants-turned-into-dancefloors are flooding Moscow streets with new openings every year. The hottest area is located around the old chocolate factory, where bars, nightclubs, galleries, cafés and restaurants are placed.[145]\n\n\nDream Island is an amusement park in Moscow that opened on February 29, 2020.[146][147] It is the largest indoor theme park in Europe.\nThe park covers 300,000 square meters. During the park's construction, 150 acres of nature trees unique and rare animals and birds and plants on the peninsula were destroyed. The appearance is in the style of a fairytale castle similar to Disneyland. The park has 29 unique attractions with many rides, as well as pedestrian malls with fountains and cycle paths. The complex includes a landscaped park along with a concert hall, a cinema, a hotel, a children's sailing school, restaurants, and shops.\n\n\n\n## Authorities[edit]\n\n\n### Moscow authorities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Government of Moscow, Mayor of Moscow, Moscow City Duma, and Charter of the city of Moscow\n\n![](image)Government of Moscow\nAccording to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Moscow is an independent federal subject of the Russian Federation, the so-called city of federal importance.\n\n\nThe Mayor of Moscow is the leading official in the executive, leading the Government of Moscow, which is the highest organ of executive power.\nThe Moscow City Duma is the City Duma (city council or local parliament) and local laws must be approved by it. It includes 45 members who are elected for a five-year term on Single-mandate constituency basis.\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2012, direct elections of the mayor were not held due to changes in the Charter of the city of Moscow, the mayor was appointed by presidential decree. The first direct elections from the time of the 2003 vote were to be held after the expiration of the current mayor in 2015, however, in connection with his resignation of his own free will, they took place in September 2013.\n\n\nLocal administration is carried out through eleven prefectures, uniting the districts of Moscow into administrative districts on a territorial basis, and 125 regional administrations. According to the law \"On the organization of local self-government in the city of Moscow\", since the beginning of 2003, the executive bodies of local self-government are municipalities, representative bodies are municipal assemblies, whose members are elected in accordance with the Charter of the intracity municipality.\n\n\n\n### Federal authorities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: White House (Moscow) and State Duma\n\n![](image)The House of the Government of the Russian Federation\nIn Moscow, as in a city endowed with the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the legislative, executive, and judicial federal authorities of the country are located, with the exception of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, which has been located in Saint Petersburg since 2008.\n\n\nThe supreme executive authority - the Government of the Russian Federation - is located in the House of the Government of the Russian Federation on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment in the center of Moscow. The State Duma sits on Okhotny Ryad. The Federation Council is located in a building on Bolshaya Dmitrovka. The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and the Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Russian Federation are also located in Moscow.\n\n\nIn addition, the Moscow Kremlin is the official residence of the President of the Russian Federation. The president's working residence in the Kremlin is located in the Senate Palace.\n\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A BMW 5 Series of the Moscow Police on patrol\nAccording to the ranking of the safest cities made by The Economist Moscow occupies the 37th position with a score of 68,5 points percent.[148] The general level of crime is quite low.[149] More than 170,000 surveillance cameras in Moscow are connected to the facial recognition system. The authorities recognized the successful two-month experiment with automatic recognition of faces, gender, and age of people in real-time - and then they deployed the system to the whole city. The network of video surveillance unites access video cameras (95% of residential apartment buildings in the capital), cameras in the territory and in buildings of schools and kindergartens, at the MCC stations, stadiums, public transport stops, and bus stations, in parks, underground passages.[150]\n\n\nThe emergency numbers are the same as in all the other regions of Russia: 112 is the Single Emergency Number, 101 is the number of the Fire Service and Ministry of Emergency Situations, 102 is the Police one, 103 is the ambulance one, 104 is the Emergency Gas number.[151] Moscow's EMS is the second most efficient one among the world's megacities, as reported by PwC during the presentation of the international study Analysis of EMS Efficiency in Megacities of the World.[152]\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Moscow\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Federal city of Moscow\n | ![Coat of arms of Moscow](image) |\n| **City administrative divisions** | 12\n |\n| **City districts** | 125\n |\n| **City settlements** | 21\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Moscow is divided into **12 administrative districts**:\n | ![](image) |\n| 1.

Troitsky Administrative Okrug\n |\n\n\n![](image)Territorial change of Moscow from 1922 to 1995\nThe entire city of Moscow is headed by one mayor (Sergey Sobyanin). The city of Moscow is divided into twelve administrative okrugs and 125 districts.\n\n\nThe Russian capital's town-planning development began to show as early as the 12th century when the city was founded. The central part of Moscow grew by consolidating with suburbs in line with medieval principles of urban development when strong fortress walls would gradually spread along the circle streets of adjacent new settlements. The first circular defence walls set the trajectory of Moscow's rings, laying the groundwork for the future planning of the Russian capital.\n\n\nThe following fortifications served as the city's circular defense boundaries at some point in history: the Kremlin walls, Zemlyanoy Gorod (Earthwork Town), the Kamer-Kollezhsky Rampart, the Garden Ring, and the small railway ring. The Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) has been Moscow's boundary since 1960. Also in the form of a circle are the main Moscow subway line, the Ring Line, and the so-called Third Automobile Ring, which was completed in 2005. Hence, the characteristic radial-circle planning continues to define Moscow's further development. However, contemporary Moscow has also engulfed a number of territories outside the MKAD, such as Solntsevo, Butovo, and the town of Zelenograd. A part of Moscow Oblast's territory was merged into Moscow on July 1, 2012; as a result, Moscow is no longer fully surrounded by Moscow Oblast and now also has a border with Kaluga Oblast.[153] In all, Moscow gained about 1,500 square kilometers (580 sq mi) and 230,000 inhabitants. Moscow's Mayor Sergey Sobyanin lauded the expansion that will help Moscow and the neighboring region, a \"mega-city\" of twenty million people, to develop \"harmonically\".[57]\n\n\nAll administrative okrugs and districts have their own coats of arms and flags as well as individual heads of the area.\n\n\nIn addition to the districts, there are Territorial Units with Special Status. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations. Such is the case with the All-Russia Exhibition Centre, the Botanical Garden, large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different districts. There are no ethnic-specific regions in Moscow, as in the Chinatowns that exist in some North American and East Asian cities. And although districts are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city center, metro stations or green zones are considered more prestigious.[154]\n\n\nMoscow also hosts some of the government bodies of Moscow Oblast, although the city itself is not a part of the oblast.[155]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Russia\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Largest private companies basedin Moscow** (ranked by 2019 revenues) |\n| **Moscow** |  | **corporation** |  | **Russia** |\n| 1 |  | Lukoil |  | 1\n |\n| 2 |  | X5 Retail Group |  | 3\n |\n| 3 |  | Novatek |  | 6\n |\n| 4 |  | Nornickel |  | 9\n |\n| 5 |  | UC Rusal |  | 11\n |\n| 6 |  | Sibur |  | 13\n |\n| 7 |  | SUEK |  | 15\n |\n| 8 |  | MTS |  | 17\n |\n| 9 |  | Metalloinvest |  | 18\n |\n| 10 |  | EuroChem |  | 21\n |\n| 11 |  | MegaFon |  | 22\n |\n| 12 |  | M.video |  | 24\n |\n| 13 |  | TMK |  | 25\n |\n| 14 |  | Mechel |  | 26\n |\n| **Source:** *Forbes*[156] |\n\n\n![](image)Moscow International Business Center, one of the largest financial centres of Europe and the world\nMoscow has one of the largest municipal economies in Europe and it accounts more than one-fifth of Russia's gross domestic product (GDP).[157] As of 2021[update], the GRP of Moscow reached almost ₽24.5 trillion(US$332 billion).[158] GMP of Moscow Region was ₽31.3 trillion or around US$425 billion.\n\n\n\n![](image)Moscow Exchange\nThe average gross monthly wage in the city is ₽123,688[159] (US$2,000), which is around twice the national average of ₽66,572 (US$1,000), and one of the highest among the federal subjects of Russia.\n\n\nMoscow is home to the third-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world,[160] and has the highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe. It is the financial center of Russia and home to the country's largest banks and many of its largest companies, such as oil giant Rosneft. Moscow accounts for 17% of retail sales in Russia and for 13% of all construction activity in the country.[161][162] Since the 1998 Russian financial crisis, business sectors in Moscow have shown exponential rates of growth. Many new business centers and office buildings have been built in recent years, but Moscow still experiences shortages in office space. As a result, many former industrial and research facilities are being reconstructed to become suitable for office use. Overall, economic stability has improved in recent years; nonetheless, crime and corruption still hinder business development.\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nPrimary industries in Moscow include the chemical, metallurgy, food, textile, furniture, energy production, software development and machinery industries.\n\n\nThe Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant is one of the world's leading producers of military and civil helicopters. Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center produces various space equipment, including modules for space stations Mir, Salyut and the ISS as well as Proton launch vehicles and military ICBMs. Sukhoi, Ilyushin, Mikoyan, Tupolev and Yakovlev aircraft design bureaus also situated in Moscow. NPO Energomash, producing the rocket engines for Russian and American space programs, as well as Lavochkin design bureau, which built fighter planes during WWII, but switched to space probes since the Space Race, are in nearby Khimki, an independent city in Moscow Oblast that have largely been enclosed by Moscow from its sides. Automobile plants ZiL and AZLK, as well as the Voitovich Rail Vehicle plant, are situated in Moscow and Metrovagonmash metro wagon plant is located just outside the city limits. The Poljot Moscow watch factory produces military, professional and sport watches well known in Russia and abroad. Yuri Gagarin in his trip into space used \"Shturmanskie\" produced by this factory.\n\n\nThe Electrozavod factory was the first transformer factory in Russia. The Kristall distillery[163] is the oldest distillery in Russia producing vodka types, including \"Stolichnaya\" while wines are produced at Moscow wine plants, including the Moscow Interrepublican Vinery.[164] The Moscow Jewelry Factory[165] and the Jewellerprom[166] are producers of jewelry in Russia; Jewellerprom used to produce the exclusive Order of Victory, awarded to those aiding the Soviet Union's Red Army during World War II.\n\n\nThere are other industries located just outside the city of Moscow, as well as microelectronic industries in Zelenograd, including Ruselectronics companies.\n\n\nGazprom, the largest extractor of natural gas in the world and the largest Russian company, has head offices also in Moscow, as well as other oil, gas, and electricity companies.\n\n\nMoscow hosts headquarters of the many of telecommunication and technology companies, including 1C, ABBYY, Beeline, Kaspersky Lab, Mail.Ru Group, MegaFon, MTS, Rambler&Co, Rostelecom, Yandex, and Yota.\n\n\nSome industry is being transferred out of the city to improve the ecological state of the city.\n\n\n\n### Cost of living[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hotels in Moscow\n\n![](image)Tretyakovsky Proyezd\n![](image)Nikolskaya Street\n![](image)A microdistrict in Mitino built in the 1990s\nDuring Soviet times, apartments were lent to people by the government according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes, and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors). Private ownership of apartments was limited until the 1990s when people were permitted to secure property rights to their inhabited places. Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area.\n\n\nThe price of real estate in Moscow continues to rise. Today, one could expect to pay $4,000 on average per square meter (11 sq ft) on the outskirts of the city[167] or US$6,500–$8,000 per square meter in a prestigious district. The price sometimes may exceed US$40,000 per square meter in a flat.[168][169][170] It costs about US$1,200 per month to rent a one-bedroom apartment and about US$1,000 per month for a studio in the center of Moscow.\n\n\nA typical one-bedroom apartment is about thirty square metres (320 square feet), a typical two-bedroom apartment is forty-five square metres (480 square feet), and a typical three-bedroom apartment is seventy square metres (750 square feet). Many cannot move out of their apartments, especially if a family lives in a two-room apartment originally granted by the state during the Soviet era. Some city residents have attempted to cope with the cost of living by renting their apartments while staying in dachas (country houses) outside the city.\n\n\nIn 2006, Mercer Human Resources Consulting named Moscow the world's most expensive city for expatriate employees, ahead of perennial winner Tokyo, due to the stable Russian ruble as well as increasing housing prices within the city.[171] Moscow also ranked first in the 2007 edition and 2008 edition of the survey. However, Tokyo has overtaken Moscow as the most expensive city in the world, placing Moscow at third behind Osaka in second place.[172]\n\n\nIn 2008, Moscow ranked top on the list of most expensive cities for the third year in a row.[173]\n\n\nIn 2014, according to *Forbes*, Moscow was ranked the 9th most expensive city in the world. *Forbes* ranked Moscow the 2nd most expensive city the year prior.[174]\n\n\nIn 2019 the Economist Intelligence Unit's Worldwide Cost of Living survey put Moscow to 102nd place in the biannual ranking of 133 most expensive cities.[175] ECA International's Cost of Living 2019 Survey ranked Moscow at number 120 among 482 locations worldwide.[176]\n\n\n\n### Public utilities[edit]\n\n\n#### Heating[edit]\n\n\nThe heating of buildings in Moscow, like in other cities in Russia is done using central heating system. Before 2004, state unitary enterprises were responsible to produce and supply heat to the clients by the operation of heating stations and heating distribution system of Mosgorteplo, Mosteploenergo, and Teploremontnaladka which gave service to the heating substations in the north-eastern part of the city. Clients were divided between the various enterprises based on their geographical location. A major reform launched in 2004 consolidated the various companies under the umbrella of MIPC which became the municipal heat supplier. Its subsidiaries were the newly transformed Joint-stock companies. The city's main source of heating is the power station of Mosenergo which was reformed in 2005, when around ten subsidiaries were separated from it. One of the newly independent companies was the District Heating Network Company (MTK) (Russian: Московская теплосетевая компания). In 2007 the Government of Moscow bought controlling stakes in the company.[177]\n\n\n\n#### City services[edit]\n\n\n\"Our city\" is a geo-information portal created in 2011 under the mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin with the aim of building a constructive dialogue between Moscow residents and the city's executive authorities. The portal is being developed by the State Public Institution \"New Management Technologies\" together with the Moscow Department of Information Technologies. In its 10 years of operation, more than 1.7 million users have joined the portal, and during this time it has become an effective tool for monitoring the state of urban infrastructure.[178]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Russia\n\n![](image)Moscow State University\nThere are 1,696 high schools in Moscow, as well as 91 colleges.[114] Besides these, there are 222 institutions of higher education, including 60 state universities[114] and the Lomonosov Moscow State University, which was founded in 1755.[179] The main university building located in Vorobyovy Gory (Sparrow Hills) is 240 metres (790 ft) tall and when completed, was the tallest building on the continent.[180] The university has over 30,000 undergraduate and 7,000 postgraduate students, who have a choice of twenty-nine faculties and 450 departments for study. Additionally, approximately 10,000 high school students take courses at the university, while over two thousand researchers work. The Moscow State University library contains over nine million books, making it one of the largest libraries in all of Russia. Its acclaim throughout the international academic community has meant that over 11,000 international students have graduated from the university, with many coming to Moscow to become fluent in the Russian language.[181]\n\n\nThe I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University named after Ivan Sechenov or formerly known as Moscow Medical Academy (1stMSMU) is a medical university situated in Moscow, Russia. It was founded in 1785 as the faculty of the Moscow State University. It is a Russian Federal Agency for Health and Social Development. It is one of the largest medical universities in Russia and Europe. More than 9200 students are enrolled in 115 academic departments. It offers courses for post-graduate studies.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University\nThe Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University (formerly known as Russian State Medical University) is a medical higher education institution in Moscow, Russia founded in 1906. It is fully accredited and recognized by Russia's Ministry of Education and Science and is currently under the authority of the Ministry of Health and Social Development. Named after Russian surgeon and pedagogue N.I. Pirogov (1810-1888), it is one of the largest medical institutions and the first university in Russia to allow women to acquire degrees.\n\n\nMoscow is one of the financial centers of the Russian Federation and CIS countries and is known for its business schools. Among them are the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; The State University of Management, and the National Research University - Higher School of Economics. They offer undergraduate degrees in management, finance, accounting, marketing, real estate, and economic theory, as well as Masters programs and MBAs. Most of them have branches in other regions of Russia and countries around the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)The main building of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University\nBauman Moscow State Technical University, founded in 1830, is located in the center of Moscow and provides 18,000 undergraduate and 1,000 postgraduate students with an education in science and engineering, offering technical degrees.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Moscow Conservatory building\nThe Moscow Conservatory,[183] founded in 1866, is a prominent music school in Russia whose graduates include Sergey Rachmaninoff, Alexander Scriabin, Aram Khachaturian, Mstislav Rostropovich, and Alfred Schnittke.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Russian State Institute of Cinematography, the world's oldest  \nfilm school\nThe Gerasimov All-Russian State Institute of Cinematography, abbreviated as VGIK, is the world's oldest educational institution in Cinematography, founded by Vladimir Gardin in 1919.\nSergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Aleksey Batalov were among its most distinguished professors and Mikhail Vartanov, Sergei Parajanov, Andrei Tarkovsky, Nikita Mikhalkov, Eldar Ryazanov, Alexander Sokurov, Yuriy Norshteyn, Aleksandr Petrov, Vasily Shukshin, Konrad Wolf among graduates.\n\n\nMoscow State Institute of International Relations, founded in 1944, remains Russia's best- known school of international relations and diplomacy, with six schools focused on international relations. Approximately 4,500 students make up the university's student body and over 700,000 Russian and foreign-language books—of which 20,000 are considered rare—can be found in the library of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.[184]\n\n\nOther institutions are the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, also known as Phystech, the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov, the Moscow Aviation Institute, the Moscow Motorway Institute (State Technical University), and the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology has taught numerous Nobel Prize winners, including Pyotr Kapitsa, Nikolay Semyonov, Lev Landau and Alexander Prokhorov, while the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute is known for its research in nuclear physics.[185] The highest Russian military school is the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.\n\n\nAlthough Moscow has a number of famous Soviet-era higher educational institutions, most of which are more oriented towards engineering or the fundamental sciences, in recent years Moscow has seen a growth in the number of commercial and private institutions that offer classes in business and management. Many state institutions have expanded their education scope and introduced new courses or departments. Institutions in Moscow, as well as the rest of post-Soviet Russia, have begun to offer new international certificates and postgraduate degrees, including the Master of Business Administration. Student exchange programs with numerous countries, specially with the rest of Europe, have also become widespread in Moscow's universities, while schools within the Russian capital also offer seminars, lectures, and courses for corporate employees and businessmen.\n\n\n\n![](image)Russian Academy of Sciences\nMoscow is one of the largest science centers in Russia. The headquarters of the Russian Academy of Sciences are located in Moscow as well as research and applied science institutions. The Kurchatov Institute, Russia's leading research and development institution in the fields of nuclear energy, where the first nuclear reactor in Europe was built, the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics, Kapitza Institute for Physical Problems and Steklov Institute of Mathematics are all situated in Moscow.\n\n\nThere are 452 libraries in the city, including 168 for children.[114] The Russian State Library,[186] founded in 1862, is the national library of Russia. The library is home to over 275 km (171 mi) of shelves and 42 million items, including over 17 million books and serial volumes, 13 million journals, 350,000 music scores and sound records, and 150,000 maps, making it the largest library in Russia and one of the largest in the world. Items in 247 languages account for 29% of the collection.[187][188]\n\n\nThe State Public Historical Library, founded in 1863, is the largest library specialising in Russian history. Its collection contains four million items in 112 languages (including 47 languages of the former USSR), mostly on Russian and world history, heraldry, numismatics, and the history of science.[189]\n\n\nIn regard to primary and secondary education, in 2011, Clifford J. Levy of *The New York Times* wrote, \"Moscow has some strong public schools, but the system as a whole is dispiriting, in part because it is being corroded by the corruption that is a post-Soviet scourge. Parents often pay bribes to get their children admitted to better public schools. There are additional payoffs for good grades.\"[190]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Moscow\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Metro\n\n![](image)Moscow Metro route map with planned stations\n![](image)Mayakovskaya station, opened in 1938\nThe Moscow Metro system is famous for its art, murals, mosaics, and ornate chandeliers. It started operation in 1935 and immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and reward the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Lazar Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilisation as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new \"Homo Sovieticus\" (Soviet man).[191]\n\n\nThe metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order—a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.[192] Soviet workers did the labour and the artwork, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground. The Britons called for tunneling instead of the \"cut-and-cover\" technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, and designed the routes and the rolling stock.[193] The paranoia of Stalin and the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage—that is for gaining an in-depth knowledge of the city's physical layout. Engineers for the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company were given a show trial and deported in 1933, ending the role of British business in the USSR.[194]\n\n\nToday, the Moscow Metro comprises twelve lines, mostly underground with a total of 203 stations. The Metro is one of the deepest subway systems in the world; for instance, the Park Pobedy station, completed in 2003, at 84 metres (276 ft) underground, has the longest escalators in Europe. The Moscow Metro is the busiest metro system in Europe, as well as one of the world's busiest metro systems, serving about ten million passengers daily (300,000,000 people every month).[195] Facing serious transportation problems, Moscow has plans for expanding its Metro. In 2016, the authorities launched a new circle metro railway that contributed to solving transportation issues, namely daily congestion at Koltsevaya Line.[196]\n\n\nDue to the treatment of Metro stations as possible canvas for art, characterized by the fact that workers of Moscow would get to see them every day, many Stalin-era metro stations were built in different \"custom\" designs (where each station's design would be, initially, a massive installation on a certain theme. For example, Elektrozavodskaya station was themed solely after nearby lightbulb factory and ceramic ribbed lightbulb sockets);[197] the tradition of \"Grand Designs\" and, basically, decorating metro stations as single-themed installations, was restored in late 1979.\n\n\nMore recently, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin has introduced comforts ranging from WiFi and USB ports and Apple Pay — while opening new stations at a breakneck pace. Moscow's metro is one of the world's busiest, handling 2.6 billion passengers in 2019.[198]\n\n\nIn the Russian capital, there are over 21.5 thousand Wi-Fi access points, in student dormitories, in parks, cultural and sports institutions, and within the Garden Ring and the Third Transport Ring. From September 2020 to August 2021, 1,700 new access points to urban Wi-Fi were launched in Moscow.[199] The structure of the Wi-Fi network allows citizens to use the Internet without re-authorization.[200]\n\n\n\n### Monorail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Monorail\n\n![](image)Two trains of the Moscow Monorail\nThe Moscow Metro operates a short monorail line (line 13). The line connects Timiryazevskaya metro station and Ulitsa Sergeya Eisensteina, passing close to VDNH (and Line 6 Metro station \"V.D.N.Kh.\"). The line opened in 2004. It accepts overground interchanges, no additional fare is needed if a ride was spent at Moscow Metro within previous 90 minutes.\n\n\n\n### Bus, trolleybus and electric bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electric buses in Moscow\n\n![](image)Moscow has the largest fleet of electric buses in Europe, with 500 operating as of October 2020[update].[201]\nAs Metro stations outside the city center are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to 4 kilometres (2.5 mi), a bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones. Moscow has a bus terminal for long-range and intercity passenger buses (Central Bus Terminal) with a daily turnover of about 25 thousand passengers serving about 40% of long-range bus routes in Moscow.[202]\n\n\nEvery major street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by a trolleybus route and have trolley wires over them.\n\n\nWith the total line length of almost 600 kilometres (370 miles) of a single wire, 8 depots, 104 routes, and 1740 vehicles, the Moscow trolleybus system was the largest in the world. But municipal authority, headed by Sergey Sobyanin, began to destroy the trolleybus system in Moscow in 2014 due the planned replacement of trolleybuses by electric buses. In 2018 Moscow trolleybus system has only 4 depots and dozens of kilometers of unused wires. Almost all trolleybus wires inside Garden Ring (Sadovoe Koltso) were cut in 2016–2017 due to the reconstruction of central streets (\"Moya Ulitsa\"). Opened on November 15, 1933, it is also the world's 6th oldest operating trolleybus system.\n\n\nIn 2018 the vehicle companies Kamaz and GAZ have won the Mosgortrans tender for delivering 200 electric buses and 62 ultra-fast charging stations to the city transport system. The manufacturers will be responsible for the quality and reliable operation of the buses and charging stations for the next 15 years. The city will be procuring only electric buses as of 2021, replacing the diesel bus fleet gradually. According to expectations, Moscow will become the leader amongst the European cities in terms of electric and gas fuel share in public transport by 2019.[203]\n\n\nAll bus stations and terminals of Moscow are now connected to free Wi-Fi. One may use it in international bus stations Salaryevo, South Gate and North Gate, and in bus terminals Varshavskaya and Orekhovo. As much as 48 hot spots were installed there.[204]\n\n\n\n### Moscow cable car[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moskva River cable car\n\n![](image)Cable cars passing across the Moskva River and the Luzhniki Stadium\nOn November 26, 2018, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin took part in the ceremony to open the cable car above the Moskva River. The cable car will connect the Luzhniki sports complex with Sparrow Hills and Kosygin Street.\n\n\nThe journey from the well-known viewpoint on Vorobyovy Gory to Luzhniki Stadium will last for five minutes instead of 20 minutes that one would have to spend on the same journey by car. The cable car will work every day from 11 a.m. till 11 p.m.\n\n\nThe cable car is 720 meters (2,360 ft) long. It was built to transport 1,600 passengers per hour in all weathers. There are 35 closed capsules designed by Porsche Design Studio to transport passengers. The booths are equipped with media screens, LED lights, hooks for bikes, skis, and snowboards. Passengers will also be able to use audio guides in English, German, Chinese and Russian.\n\n\n\n### Tram[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Trams in Moscow\n\n![](image)A Vityaz-M tram passing by the Tverskaya Zastava Square\nMoscow has an extensive tram system, which first opened in 1899.[205] The newest line was built in 1984. Its daily usage by Muscovites is low, making up for approximately 5% of trips because many vital connections in the network have been withdrawn. Trams still remain important in some districts as feeders to Metro stations. The trams also provide important cross-links between metro lines, for example between Universitet station of Sokolnicheskaya Line (#1 red line) and Profsoyuznaya station of Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line (#6 orange line) or between Voykovskaya and Strogino. Some routes used to connect downtown with sleep districts, like route 3.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tram map of Moscow\nThere are three tram networks in the city:\n\n\n\n* Krasnopresnenskoye depot network with the westernmost point at Strogino (depot location) and the easternmost point near platform Dmitrovskaya. This network became separated in 1973, but until 1997 it could easily have been reconnected by about one kilometre (fifty chains) of track and three switches. The network has the highest usage in Moscow and no weak points based on turnover except to-depot lane (passengers serviced by bus) and tram ring at Dmitrovskaya (because now it is neither a normal transfer point nor a repair terminal).\n* The Apakov depot services the south-western part from the Varshavsky lane – Simferopolsky boulevard in the east to the Universitet station in the west and Boulevard lane at the center. This network is connected only by the four-way Dubininskaya and Kozhevnicheskaya streets. A second connection by Vostochnaya (Eastern) street was withdrawn in 1987 due to a fire at the Dinamo plant and has not been recovered, and remains lost (Avtozavodsky bridge) at 1992. The network may be serviced anyway by another depot (now route 35, 38).\n* Main three depot networks with railway gate and tram-repair plant.\n\n\nIn addition, tram advocates have suggested that the new rapid transit services (metro to City, Butovo light metro, Monorail) would be more effective as at-grade tram lines and that the problems with trams are only due to poor management and operation, not the technical properties of trams. New tram models have been developed for the Moscow network despite the lack of expansion.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nCommercial taxi services and route taxis are in widespread use. In the mid-2010s, service platforms such as Yandex.Taxi, Uber and Gett displaced many private drivers and small service providers and were in 2015 servicing more than 50% of all taxi orders in Moscow.[206][207]\n\n\nRussian tech firm Yandex is testing self-driving taxis in Moscow. Yandex's fleet of around 170 driverless cars has travelled more than 14 million kilometres. Robotaxis will available through the company's Yandex.Go application in Yasenevo district.[208]\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Komsomolskaya Square known as \"Three Station Square\" thanks to three ornate rail terminal situated there: Leningradsky, Yaroslavsky, and Kazansky. Several train stations serve the city. Moscow's ten rail terminals (or *vokzals*) are:\n\n\n* Belorussky Rail Terminal\n* Kazansky Rail Terminal\n* Kiyevsky Rail Terminal\n* Kursky Rail Terminal\n* Leningradsky Rail Terminal\n* Paveletsky Rail Terminal\n* Rizhsky Rail Terminal\n* Savyolovsky Rail Terminal\n* Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal\n* Vostochny railway Terminal\n\n\n![](image)The high-speed Sapsan train links Moscow with Saint Petersburg.\nThe terminals are located close to the city center, along with the metro ringline 5 or close to it, and connect to a metro line to the centre of town. Each station handles trains from different parts of Europe and Asia.[209] There are many smaller railway stations in Moscow. As train tickets are cheap, they are the preferred mode of travel for Russians, especially when departing to Saint Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city. Moscow is the western terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, which traverses nearly 9,300 kilometres (5,800 mi) of Russian territory to Vladivostok on the Pacific coast.\n\n\nSuburbs and satellite cities are connected by commuter elektrichka (electric rail) network. Elektrichkas depart from each of these terminals to the nearby (up to 140 km or 87 mi) large railway stations.\n\n\nDuring the 2010s, the Little Ring of the Moscow Railway was converted to be used for frequent passenger service; it is fully integrated with Moscow Metro; the passenger service started on September 10, 2016. A connecting railway line on the North side of the town connects Belorussky terminal with other railway lines. This is used by some suburban trains.\n\n\n\n#### Moscow Central Circle[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Lastochka\" train on \"Luzhniki\" station (Line 14)\nThe Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga formed a ring around the now-downtown Moscow since 1903, but only served as a non-electrified, fueled locomotive-only railway prior to reconstruction into MCC in 2010's.\n\n\nThe Moscow Central Circle is a 54-kilometre-long (34 mi) urban-metro railway orbital line that encircles historical Moscow. It was built alongside Little Ring of the Moscow Railway, taking some of its tracks into itself as well. M.C.C. was opened for passenger use on September 10, 2016. MOZD is integrated as \"Line 14 of Moscow Metro\", and, while using railway-sized trains, can be perceived as \"S-train-design circle line\".\n\n\nThe line is operated by the Moscow Government owned company MKZD through the Moscow Metro, with the Federal Government owned Russian Railways selected as the operation subcontractor. The track infrastructure and most platforms are owned by Russian Railways, while MKZD owns most station buildings. However, in *S-bahn* way, Moscow unified tickets \"Ediniiy\" and \"Troika\" are accepted by MCC stations. There is one zero-fee interchange for any ticket used on Moscow Metro station less than 90 minutes before entering an MCC station (and vice versa: a passenger of MCC gets 1 free interchange to Moscow Metro within 90 minutes after entering MCC station)\n\n\n\n#### Moscow Central Diameters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An EG2Tv train arriving at the Moscow Belorussky railway station\n![](image)Map of the Moscow Central Diameters\nAnother system, which forms \"genuine *S-Bahn*\" as in \"suburbia-city-suburbia\"-designed railway, is the Moscow Central Diameters, a pass-through railways system, created by constructing bypasses from \"vokzals\" final stations (e.g. by avoiding the central stations of already existing Moscow Railway, used for both intercity and urban-suburban travel before)[210] and forming a train line across Moscow's centre.\n\n\nOut of 5 projected lines, the first 2 lines were completed and launched on 2019-11-21 (e.g. November 21, 2019).\n\n\nWhile using the same rails as \"regular\" suburban trains to vokzals, MCD trains (\"*Ivolga*\" model) got distinguishing features (shape; red cabin, different windows, lesser amount of seats; big red \"MЦΔ\" train logo).\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Intersection at Tverskaya Zastava Square\nThere are over 2.6 million cars in the city daily. Recent years have seen growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and lack of parking space to become major problems.\n\n\nThe Moscow Ring Road (MKAD), along with the Third Transport Ring and the canceled Fourth Transport Ring, is one of only three freeways that run within Moscow city limits. Several other roadway systems form concentric circles around the city.\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nThere are five primary commercial airports serving Moscow: Sheremetyevo (SVO), Domodedovo (DME), Vnukovo (VKO), Zhukovsky (ZIA), Ostafyevo (OSF).\n\n\n\n![](image)Sheremetyevo, the busiest airport in Russia, is ranked as the second-busiest airport in Europe.\nSheremetyevo International Airport is the most globally connected of Moscow's airports, handling 60% of all international flights.[211] It is also a home to all SkyTeam members, and the main hub for Aeroflot (itself a member of SkyTeam). Domodedovo International Airport is the leading airport in Russia in terms of passenger throughput and is the primary gateway to long-haul domestic and CIS destinations and its international traffic rivals Sheremetyevo. It is a hub for S7 airlines, and most of OneWorld and Star Alliance members use Domodedovo as their international hub. Vnukovo International Airport handles flights of Turkish Airlines, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi and others. Ostafyevo International Airport caters primarily to business aviation.\n\n\nMoscow's airports vary in distances from the MKAD beltway: Domodedovo is the farthest at 22 km (14 mi); Vnukovo is 11 km (7 mi); Sheremetyevo is 10 km (6 mi); and Ostafievo, the nearest, is about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from MKAD.[211]\n\n\nThere are a number of smaller airports close to Moscow (19 in Moscow Oblast) such as Myachkovo Airport, that are intended for private aircraft, helicopters and charters.[212]\n\n\n\n### Water[edit]\n\n\nMoscow has two passenger terminals, (South River Terminal and North River Terminal or Rechnoy vokzal), on the river and regular ship routes and cruises along the Moskva and Oka rivers, which are used mostly for entertainment. The North River Terminal, built in 1937, is the main hub for long-range river routes. There are three freight ports serving Moscow.\n\n\n\n### Sharing system[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carsharing in Moscow\n\n![](image)As of 2020[update], Moscow has the largest fleet of carsharing vehicles in the world, with more than 30,000 cars.[213]\nMoscow has different vehicle sharing options that are sponsored by the local government. There are several car sharing companies which are in charge of providing cars to the population. To drive the automobiles, the user has to book them through the app of the owning company. In 2018 the mayor Sergey Sobyanin said Moscow's car sharing system has become the biggest in Europe in terms of vehicle fleet.[214] Every day about 25,000 people use this service. In the end of the same year Moscow carsharing became the second in the world in therms of fleet with 16.5K available vehicles.[215] Another sharing system is bike sharing (*Velobike*) of a fleet formed by 3000 traditional and electrical bicycles.[216] The *Delisamokat* is a new sharing service that provides electrical scooters.[217] There are companies that provide different vehicles to the population in proximity to Moscow's big parks.\n\n\n\n### Future development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2020 development concept of Moscow International Business Center and its adjacent territory implies the construction of even more skyscrapers during the period of 2020–2027.[218][219]\nIn 1992, the Moscow government began planning a projected new part of central Moscow, the Moscow International Business Center, with the goal of creating a zone, the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe,[220] that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment. Situated in Presnensky District and located at the Third Ring, the Moscow City area is under intense development. The construction of the MIBC takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. The whole project takes up to one square kilometre (250 acres). The area is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude. Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.\n\n\nThe Federation Tower, completed in 2016, is the second-tallest building in Europe. It is planned to include a water park and other recreational facilities; business, office, entertainment, and residential buildings, a transport network and a new site for the Moscow government. The construction of four new metro stations in the territory has been completed, two of which have opened and two others are reserved for future metro lines crossing MIBC, some additional stations were planned. \n\n\n\n* A rail shuttle service, directly connecting MIBC with the Sheremetyevo International Airport is also planned.\n\n\nMajor thoroughfares through MIBC are the Third Ring and Kutuzovsky Prospekt.\n\n\nThree metro stations were initially planned for the Filyovskaya Line. The station Delovoi Tsentr opened in 2005 and was later renamed Vystavochnaya in 2009. The branch extended to the Mezhdunarodnaya station in 2006, and all work on the third station, Dorogomilovskaya (between Kiyevskaya and Delovoi Tsentr), has been postponed.

The city stands on the Moskva River in Central Russia, with a population estimated at 13.0 million residents within the city limits,[6] over 18.8 million residents in the urban area,[7] and over 21.5 million residents in the metropolitan area.[14] The city covers an area of 2,511 square kilometers (970 sq mi), while the urban area covers 5,891 square kilometers (2,275 sq mi),[7] and the metropolitan area covers over 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 sq mi).[14] Moscow is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city entirely in Europe, the largest urban and metropolitan area in Europe,[7][14] and the largest city by land area on the European continent.[15]\n\n\nFirst documented in 1147, Moscow grew to become a prosperous and powerful city that served as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. When the Tsardom of Russia was proclaimed, Moscow remained the political and economic center for most of its history. Under the reign of Peter the Great, the Russian capital was moved to the newly founded city of Saint Petersburg in 1712, diminishing Moscow's influence. Following the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Russian SFSR, the capital was moved back to Moscow in 1918, where it later became the political center of the Soviet Union.[16] In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moscow remained the capital city of the newly established Russian Federation.\n\n\nThe northernmost and coldest megacity in the world, Moscow is governed as a federal city,[17] where it serves as the political, economic, cultural, and scientific center of Russia and Eastern Europe. As an alpha world city,[18] Moscow has one of the world's largest urban economies.[19] The city is one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the world,[20] and is one of Europe's most visited cities. Moscow is home to the sixth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[21] The Moscow International Business Center is one of the largest financial centers in Europe and the world, and features the majority of Europe's tallest skyscrapers. Moscow was the host city of the 1980 Summer Olympics, and one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[22]\n\n\nAs the historic core of Russia, Moscow serves as the home of numerous Russian artists, scientists, and sports figures due to the presence of its various museums, academic and political institutions, and theaters. The city is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is well known for its display of Russian architecture, particularly its historic Red Square, and buildings such as the Saint Basil's Cathedral and the Moscow Kremlin, of which the latter serves as the seat of power of the Government of Russia. Moscow is home to many Russian companies in numerous industries and is served by a comprehensive transit network, which includes four international airports, ten railway terminals, a tram system, a monorail system, and most notably the Moscow Metro, the busiest metro system in Europe, and one of the largest rapid transit systems in the world. The city has over 40 percent of its territory covered by greenery, making it one of the greenest cities in the world.[15][23]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the Moskva River.[24][25] Several theories of the origin of the name of the river have been proposed. Finno-Ugric Merya and Muroma people, who were among the several pre-Slavic tribes which originally inhabited the area, called the river supposedly *Mustajoki*, in English: *Black river*. It has been suggested that the name of the city derives from this term.[26][27]\n\n\nThe most linguistically well-grounded and widely accepted is from the Proto-Balto-Slavic root \\**mŭzg*-/*muzg*- from the Proto-Indo-European \\**meu*- \"wet\",[25][28][29] so the name *Moskva* might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh.[24] Its cognates include Russian: музга, *muzga* \"pool, puddle\", Lithuanian: *mazgoti* and Latvian: *mazgāt* \"to wash\", Sanskrit: májjati \"to drown\", Latin: *mergō* \"to dip, immerse\".[24][28] In many Slavic countries Moskov is a surname, most common in Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and North Macedonia.[30] Additionally, there are similarly named places in Poland like Mozgawa.[24][25][28]\n\n\nThe original Old Russian form of the name is reconstructed as \\*Москы, \\**Mosky*,[24][25] hence it was one of a few Slavic *ū*-stem nouns. As with other nouns of that declension, it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language, as a result, the first written mentions in the 12th century were Московь, *Moskovĭ* (accusative case), Москви, *Moskvi* (locative case), Москвe/Москвѣ, *Moskve/Moskvě* (genitive case).[24][25] From the latter forms came to the modern Russian name Москва, *Moskva*, which is a result of morphological generalization with the numerous Slavic *ā*-stem nouns.\n\n\nHowever, the form *Moskovĭ* has left some traces in many other languages, including English: Moscow, German: *Moskau*, French: *Moscou*, Georgian: მოსკოვი, Latvian: *Maskava*, Bashkir: Мәскәү, Tatar: *Mäskäw*, Portuguese: *Moscovo*, Chuvash: Мускав, and Spanish: *Moscú*. \n\n\nIn a similar manner the Latin name *Moscovia* has been formed, later it became a colloquial name for Russia used in Western Europe in the 16th–17th centuries. From it as well came English *Muscovy* and *muscovite*.[31][*failed verification*]\n\n\nVarious other theories (of Celtic, Iranian, Caucasic origins), having little or no scientific ground, are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists.[24][25]\n\n\n\n### Other names[edit]\n\n\nMoscow has acquired several epithets, most referring to its size and preeminent status within the nation: The *Third Rome* (Третий Рим), the *Whitestone One* (Белокаменная), the *First Throne* (Первопрестольная), the *Forty Soroks* (Сорок Сороков) (\"sorok\" meaning both \"forty, a great many\" and \"a district or parish\" in Old Russian). Moscow is also one of the twelve Hero Cities. The demonym for a Moscow resident is \"москвич\" (*moskvich*) for male or \"москвичка\" (*moskvichka*) for female, rendered in English as *Muscovite*. The name \"Moscow\" is abbreviated \"MSK\" (МСК in Russian).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Moscow\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Moscow.\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nArchaeological digs show that the site of today's Moscow and the surrounding area have been inhabited since time immemorial. Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture, which experts assign to the Neolithic period, the last phase of the Stone Age.[32]\n\n\nThey confirm that the first inhabitants of the area were hunters and gatherers. Around 950 AD, two Slavic tribes, Vyatichi and Krivichi, settled here. Possibly the Vyatichi formed the core of Moscow's indigenous population.[33]\n\n\n\n### Early history (1147–1284)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Kievan Rus' and Vladimir-Suzdal\n\n![](image)Vladimir-Suzdal, a principality on the northeastern periphery of Kievan Rus', grew into the Grand Duchy of Moscow.\nThe first known reference to Moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of Yuri Dolgoruky and Sviatoslav Olgovich. At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. The chronicle says, \"Come, my brother, to Moskov\" (Приди ко мне, брате, в Москов).[34]\n\n\nIn 1156, Knyaz Yuri Dolgorukiy fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat. In the course of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus', the Mongols under Batu Khan burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe timber fort *na Moskvě* \"on the Moscow River\" was inherited by Daniel, the youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, in the 1260s, at the time considered the least valuable of his father's possessions.\nDaniel was still a child at the time, and the big fort was governed by *tiuns* (deputies), appointed by Daniel's paternal uncle, Yaroslav of Tver.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDaniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success, siding with his brother Dmitry in his bid for the rule of Novgorod. From 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside Dmitry, who became Grand Duke of Vladimir.\nDaniel has been credited with founding the first Moscow monasteries, dedicated to the Lord's Epiphany and to Saint Daniel.[35]\n\n\n\n### Grand Duchy (1283–1547)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grand Duchy of Moscow\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| The Moscow Kremlin in the late 16th century\n | The 1382 siege of Moscow | Red Square |\n\n\nDaniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city that would eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s.\n\n\nOn the right bank of the Moskva River, at a distance of eight kilometres (5 mi) from the Kremlin, not later than in 1282, Daniel founded the first monastery with the wooden church of St. Daniel-Stylite, which is now the Danilov Monastery. Daniel died in 1303, at the age of 42. Before his death, he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery.\n\n\nMoscow was quite stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large number of refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing primogeniture, whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons, rather than dividing it up among all sons. By 1304, Yury of Moscow contested with Mikhail of Tver for the throne of the principality of Vladimir. Ivan I eventually defeated Tver to become the sole collector of taxes for the Mongol rulers, making Moscow the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the Khan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Spassky Cathedral (Moscow's oldest extant building), built c. 1357\nWhile the Khan of the Golden Horde initially attempted to limit Moscow's influence, when the growth of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania began to threaten all of Russia, the Khan strengthened Moscow to counterbalance Lithuania, allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in Russia. In 1380, prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Mongols in the Battle of Kulikovo. Afterward, Moscow took the leading role in liberating Russia from Mongol domination. In 1480, Ivan III had finally broken the Russians free from Tatar control, and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of Russia and Siberia, and parts of many other lands.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Spasskaya Tower, built in 1491\nIn 1462 Ivan III, (1440–1505) became Grand Prince of Moscow (then part of the medieval Muscovy state). He began fighting the Tatars, enlarged the territory of Muscovy, and enriched his capital city. By 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest cities in the world. He conquered the far larger principality of Novgorod to the north, which had been allied to the hostile Lithuanians. Thus he enlarged the territory sevenfold, from 430,000 to 2,800,000 square kilometres (170,000 to 1,080,000 square miles). He took control of the ancient \"Novgorod Chronicle\" and made it a propaganda vehicle for his regime.[36][37]\n\n\nThe original Moscow Kremlin was built in the 14th century. It was reconstructed by Ivan, who in the 1480s invited architects from Renaissance Italy, such as Petrus Antonius Solarius, who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and Marco Ruffo who designed the new palace for the prince. The Kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by Solarius, completed in 1495. The Kremlin's Great Bell Tower was built in 1505–08 and augmented to its present height in 1600.\n\n\nA trading settlement, or *posad*, grew up to the east of the Kremlin, in the area known as *Zaradye* (Зарядье). In the time of Ivan III, the Red Square, originally named the Hollow Field (Полое поле) appeared.\n\n\nIn 1508–1516, the Italian architect Aleviz Fryazin (Novy) arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall, which would connect the Moskva and Neglinnaya and be filled in with water from Neglinnaya. This moat, known as the Alevizov moat and having a length of 541 metres (1,775 feet), width of 36 metres (118 feet), and a depth of 9.5 to 13 metres (31–43 feet) was lined with limestone and, in 1533, fenced on both sides with low, four-metre-thick (13-foot) cogged-brick walls.\n\n\n\n### Tsardom (1547–1721)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Tsardom of Russia\n\n![](image)Saint Basil's Cathedral, built in 1561\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the three circular defenses were built: Kitay-gorod (Китай-город), the White City (Белый город) and the Earthen City (Земляной город). However, in 1547, two fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the Crimean Tatars captured Moscow, burning everything except the Kremlin.[38] The annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived.\n\n\n\n![](image)View of 17th-century Moscow (1922 drawing by Apollinary Vasnetsov)\nThe Crimean Tatars attacked again in 1591, but this time were held back by new defense walls, built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named Fyodor Kon. In 1592, an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city, including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River. As an outermost line of defense, a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east, principally the Novodevichy Convent and Donskoy, Danilov, Simonov, Novospasskiy, and Andronikov monasteries, most of which now house museums. From its ramparts, the city became poetically known as *Bielokamennaya*, the \"White-Walled.\" The city's limits as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the Garden Ring.\n\n\nThree square gates existed on the eastern side of the Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Saviour and St. Nicholas that hung over them). The last two were directly opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral.\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Sigismundian\" Plan of Moscow (1610), named after Sigismund III of Poland, is the last city plan compiled before the destruction of the city in 1612 by retreating Polish troops and subsequent changes to the street network. Orientation: north is at the right, west at the top.\nThe Russian famine of 1601–03 killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow. From 1610 through 1612, troops of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied Moscow, as its ruler Sigismund III tried to take the Russian throne. In 1612, the people of Nizhny Novgorod and other Russian cities conducted by prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin rose against the Polish occupants, besieged the Kremlin, and expelled them. In 1613, the Zemsky sobor elected Michael Romanov tsar, establishing the Romanov dynasty. The 17th century was rich in popular risings, such as the liberation of Moscow from the Polish–Lithuanian invaders (1612), the Salt Riot (1648), the Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising of 1682.\n\n\nDuring the first half of the 17th century, the population of Moscow doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000. It expanded beyond its ramparts in the later 17th century. It is estimated, that in the middle of the 17th century, 20% of Moscow suburb's inhabitants were from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, practically all of them being driven from their homeland to Moscow by Muscovite invaders.[39] By 1682, there were 692 households established north of the ramparts, by Ukrainians and Belarusians abducted from their hometowns in the course of the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). These new outskirts of the city came to be known as the *Meshchanskaya sloboda*, after Ruthenian *meshchane* \"town people\". The term *meshchane* (мещане) acquired pejorative connotations in 18th-century Russia and today means \"petty bourgeois\" or \"narrow-minded philistine\".[40]\n\n\nThe entire city of the late 17th century, including the slobodas that grew up outside the city ramparts, are contained within what is today Moscow's Central Administrative Okrug.\n\n\nNumerous disasters befell the city. The plague epidemics ravaged Moscow in 1570–1571, 1592 and 1654–1656.[41] The plague killed upwards of 80% of the people in 1654–55. Fires burned out much of the wooden city in 1626 and 1648.[42] In 1712 Peter the Great moved his government to the newly built Saint Petersburg on the Baltic coast. Moscow ceased to be Russia's capital, except for a brief period from 1728 to 1732 under the influence of the Supreme Privy Council.\n\n\n\n### Empire (1721–1917)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Governorate\n\nFurther information: Russian Empire\n\n![Panorama of Moscow in 1819-1823](image)\nA panoramic view of Moscow from the Spasskaya Tower in 1819–1823\n\n![](image)Moskva riverfront in the 19th century\nAfter losing the status as the capital of the empire, the population of Moscow at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750. But after 1750, the population grew more than tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915. The 1770–1772 Russian plague killed up to 100,000 people in Moscow.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bookshops at the Novospassky Bridge in the 17th century, by Apollinary Vasnetsov\nBy 1700, the building of cobbled roads had begun. In November 1730, the permanent street light was introduced, and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight. In 1883, near the Prechistinskiye Gates, arc lamps were installed. In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade 40 kilometres (25 mi) long, the Kamer-Kollezhskiy barrier, with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected. Its line is traced today by a number of streets called *val* (\"ramparts\").\nBetween 1781 and 1804 the Mytischinskiy water pipe (the first in Russia) was built. In 1813, following the destruction of much of the city during the French occupation, a Commission for the Construction of the City of Moscow was established. It launched a great program of rebuilding, including a partial replanning of the city-centre. Among many buildings constructed or reconstructed at this time was the Grand Kremlin Palace and the Kremlin Armoury, the Moscow University, the Moscow Manege (Riding School), and the Bolshoi Theatre. In 1903 the Moskvoretskaya water supply was completed.\n\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances. From this gate, wooden and (following the 17th-century improvements) stone bridges stretched across the moat. Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns – \"raskats\". The Tsar Cannon was located on the platform of the Lobnoye mesto.\n\n\nThe road connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg, now the M10 highway, was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old Tver road, which had existed since the 16th century. It became known as *Peterburskoye Schosse* after it was paved in the 1780s. Petrovsky Palace was built in 1776–1780 by Matvey Kazakov.\n\n\n\n![](image)Napoleon retreating from the city during the Fire of Moscow, after the failed French Invasion of Russia\nWhen Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, the Moscovites were evacuated. It is suspected that the Moscow fire was principally the effect of Russian sabotage. Napoleon's *Grande Armée* was forced to retreat and was nearly annihilated by the devastating Russian winter and sporadic attacks by Russian military forces. As many as 400,000 of Napoleon's soldiers died during this time.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cathedral Square during the coronation of Alexander I, 1802, by Fyodor Alekseyev\nMoscow State University was established in 1755. Its main building was reconstructed after the 1812 fire by Domenico Giliardi. The *Moskovskiye Vedomosti* newspaper appeared from 1756, originally in weekly intervals, and from 1859 as a daily newspaper.\n\n\nThe Arbat Street had been in existence since at least the 15th century, but it was developed into a prestigious area during the 18th century. It was destroyed in the fire of 1812 and was rebuilt completely in the early 19th century.\n\n\nIn the 1830s, general Alexander Bashilov planned the first regular grid of city streets north from Petrovsky Palace. Khodynka field south of the highway was used for military training. Smolensky Rail station (forerunner of present-day Belorussky Rail Terminal) was inaugurated in 1870. Sokolniki Park, in the 18th century the home of the tsar's falconers well outside Moscow, became contiguous with the expanding city in the later 19th century and was developed into a public municipal park in 1878. The suburban Savyolovsky Rail Terminal was built in 1902. In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or Mayor, was officially introduced in Moscow, and Alexander Adrianov became Moscow's first official mayor.\n\n\nWhen Catherine II came to power in 1762, the city's filth and the smell of sewage were depicted by observers as a symptom of disorderly lifestyles of lower-class Russians recently arrived from the farms. Elites called for improving sanitation, which became part of Catherine's plans for increasing control over social life. National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society. There was less talk about the smell and the poor conditions of public health. However, in the wake of Russia's failures in the Crimean War in 1855–56, confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded, and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda.[45]\n\n\n\n### Soviet period (1917–1991)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City plan of Moscow, 1917\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Song from the Soviet film |\n\n\nIn November 1917, upon learning of the uprising happening in Petrograd, Moscow's Bolsheviks also began their uprising. On November 2 (15), 1917, after heavy fighting, Soviet power was established in Moscow.[46]\n\n\nThen Vladimir Lenin, fearing possible foreign invasion, moved the capital from Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) back to Moscow on March 12, 1918.[47] The Kremlin once again became the seat of power and the political centre of the new state.\n\n\nWith the change in values imposed by communist ideology, the tradition of preservation of cultural heritage was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with the collectivization of peasants; the destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. In 1937 several letters were written to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to rename Moscow to \"Stalindar\" or \"Stalinodar,\" one from an elderly pensioner whose dream was to \"live in Stalinodar\" and had selected the name to represent the \"gift\" (dar) of the genius of Stalin.[48] Stalin rejected this suggestion, and after it was suggested again to him by Nikolai Yezhov, he was outraged, saying \"What do I need this for?\". This was following Stalin banning the renaming of places in his name in 1936.[49]\n\n\nDuring World War II, the Soviet State Committee of Defence and the General Staff of the Red Army were located in Moscow. In 1941, 16 divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), 25 battalions (18,000 people), and four engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. Between October 1941 and January 1942, the German Army Group Centre was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the Battle of Moscow. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from October 20 the city was declared to be in a state of siege. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses, while the city was bombarded from the air. On May 1, 1944, a medal \"For the defence of Moscow\" and in 1947 another medal \"In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow\" was instituted.\n\n\nBoth German and Soviet casualties during the Battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Total casualties between September 30, 1941, and January 7, 1942, are estimated to be between 248,000 and 400,000 for the Wehrmacht and between 650,000 and 1,280,000 for the Red Army.[50][51][52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Funeral procession at the funeral of Joseph Stalin, 1953\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Stalins USSR in 1953 |\n\n\nDuring the postwar years, there was a serious housing crisis, solved by the invention of high-rise apartments. There are over 11,000 of these standardised and prefabricated apartment blocks, housing the majority of Moscow's population, making it by far the city with the most high-rise buildings.[53] Apartments were built and partly furnished in the factory before being raised and stacked into tall columns. The popular Soviet-era comic film *Irony of Fate* parodies this construction method.\n\n\nThe city of Zelenograd was built in 1958 at 37 kilometres (23 miles) from the city centre to the north-west, along with the Leningradskoye Shosse, and incorporated as one of Moscow's administrative okrugs. Moscow State University moved to its campus on Sparrow Hills in 1953.\n\n\nIn 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign. By 1964 over 10 thousand churches out of 20 thousand were shut down (mostly in rural areas) and many were demolished. Of 58 monasteries and convents operating in 1959, only sixteen remained by 1964; of Moscow's fifty churches operating in 1959, thirty were closed and six demolished.\n\n\n\n![](image)Soviet parade outside Hotel Moskva on the Manezhnaya Square, 1964\nOn May 8, 1965, due to the actual 20th anniversary of the victory in World War II, Moscow was awarded a title of the Hero City.\n\n\n\n![](image)Victory Day celebration on Red Square, May 9, 1975\nThe Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) was opened in 1961. It had four lanes running 109 kilometres (68 miles) along the city borders. The MKAD marked the administrative boundaries of the city of Moscow until the 1980s when outlying suburbs beyond the ring road began to be incorporated. In 1980, Moscow hosted the Summer Olympic Games, which were boycotted by the United States and several other Western countries due to the Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan in late 1979. In 1991 Moscow was the scene of a coup attempt by conservative communists opposed to the liberal reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\n\n\n### Recent history (1991–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Floating bridge in Zaryadye Park, with the Red Square and the Moscow Kremlin in the distance\n![](image)Tverskaya Street, the main radial street in the city\nWhen the USSR was dissolved in the same year, Moscow remained the capital of the Russian SFSR (on December 25, 1991, the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation). Since then, a market economy has emerged in Moscow, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles.\n\n\nThe city has continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million. Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls (before 1991) produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935. Since then, however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments. In 1995–1997 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes.\n\n\nIn December 2002 Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD. The Third Ring Road, intermediate between the early 19th-century Garden Ring and the Soviet-era outer ring road, was completed in 2004. The greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented, and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe. Summer dachas are being converted into year-round residences, and with the proliferation of automobiles there is heavy traffic congestion.[54] Multiple old churches and other examples of architectural heritage that had been demolished during the Stalin era have been restored, such as the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.\nIn 2010s Moscow's Administration has launched some long duration projects like the *Moja Ulitsa* (in English: *My Street*) urban redevelopment program[55] or the Residency renovation one.[56]\n\n\nBy its territorial expansion on July 1, 2012, southwest into the Moscow Oblast the area of the capital more than doubled, going from 1,091 to 2,511 square kilometers (421 to 970 sq mi), resulting in Moscow becoming the largest city on the European continent by area; it also gained an additional population of 233,000 people.[57][58] The annexed territory was officially named *Новая Москва* (New Moscow).\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Moscow and its nearby suburbs\nMoscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River, which flows for just over 500 km (311 mi) through the East European Plain in central Russia, not far from the natural border of the forest and forest-steppe zone. 49 bridges span the river and its canals within the city's limits. The elevation of Moscow at the All-Russia Exhibition Center (VVC), where the leading Moscow weather station is situated, is 156 metres (512 feet). Teplostan Upland is the city's highest point at 255 metres (837 feet).[59] The width of Moscow city (not limiting MKAD) from west to east is 39.7 km (24.7 mi), and the length from north to south is 51.8 km (32.2 mi).\n\n\n\n### Time[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Time\n\nMoscow serves as the reference point for the time zone used in most of European Russia, Belarus and the Republic of Crimea. The areas operate in what is referred to in international standards as *Moscow Standard Time (MSK, МСК)*, which is 3 hours ahead of UTC, or UTC+3. Daylight saving time is no longer observed. According to the geographical longitude the average solar noon in Moscow occurs at 12:30.[60]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Moscow\n\n![](image)VDNKh after rain\nMoscow has a humid continental climate (Köppen: *Dfb*) with long, cold (although average by Russian standards) winters usually lasting from mid-November to the end of March, and warm summers. More extreme continental climates at the same latitude- such as parts of Eastern Canada or Siberia- have much colder winters than Moscow, suggesting that there is still significant moderation from the Atlantic Ocean despite the fact that Moscow is far from the sea. Weather can fluctuate widely, with temperatures ranging from −25 °C (−13 °F) in the city and −30 °C (−22 °F) in the suburbs to above 5 °C (41 °F) in the winter, and from 10 to 35 °C (50 to 95 °F) in the summer.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Petrovsky Palace on Leningradsky Avenue in winter\nTypical high temperatures in the warm months of June, July, and August are around a comfortable 20 to 26 °C (68 to 79 °F), but during heat waves (which can occur between May and September), daytime high temperatures often exceed 30 °C (86 °F), sometimes for a week or two at a time. In the winter, average temperatures normally drop to approximately −10 °C (14 °F), though almost every winter there are periods of warmth with day temperatures rising above 0 °C (32 °F), and periods of cooling with night temperatures falling below −20 °C (−4 °F). These periods usually last about a week or two. The growing season in Moscow normally lasts for 156 days usually around May 1 to October 5.[62]\n\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded was 38.2 °C (100.8 °F)[63] at the VVC weather station and 39.0 °C (102.2 °F) in the center of Moscow and Domodedovo airport on July 29, 2010, during the unusual 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves. Record high and average temperatures were recorded for January, March, April, May, June, July, August, November, and December in 2007–2022.[64] The average July temperature from 1991 to 2020 is 19.7 °C (67.5 °F). The lowest ever recorded temperature was −42.1 °C (−43.8 °F) in January 1940. Snow, which is present for about five months a year, often begins to fall mid-October, while snow cover lies in November and melts at the beginning of April.\n\n\nOn average, Moscow has 1731 hours of sunshine per year, varying from a low of 8% in December to 52% from May to August.[65] This large annual variation is due to convective cloud formation. In the winter, moist air from the Atlantic condenses in the cold continental interior, resulting in very overcast conditions. However, this same continental influence results in considerably sunnier summers than oceanic cities of similar latitude such as Edinburgh. Between 2004 and 2010, the average was between 1800 and 2000 hours with a tendency to more sunshine in summer months, up to a record 411 hours in July 2014, 79% of possible sunshine. December 2017 was the darkest month in Moscow since records began, with only six minutes of sunlight.[66][67]\n\n\nTemperatures in the centre of Moscow are often significantly higher than in the outskirts and nearby suburbs, especially in winter. For example, if the average February temperature in the north-east of Moscow is −6.7 °C (19.9 °F), in the suburbs it is about −9 °C (16 °F).[68] The temperature difference between the centre of Moscow and nearby areas of Moscow Oblast can sometimes be more than 10 °C (18 °F) on frosty winter nights.\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Moscow (VVC) normals 1991–2020, records 1879–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 28.9(84.0)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −3.9(25.0)\n | −3(27)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 19.0(66.2)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −6.2(20.8)\n | −5.9(21.4)\n | −0.7(30.7)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −4.4(24.1)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −8.7(16.3)\n | −8.8(16.2)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 8.1(46.6)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | −2.4(27.7)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | 2.6(36.7)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −42.1(−43.8)\n | −38.2(−36.8)\n | −32.4(−26.3)\n | −21(−6)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | −8.5(16.7)\n | −20.3(−4.5)\n | −32.8(−27.0)\n | −38.8(−37.8)\n | −42.1(−43.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 44(1.7)\n | 39(1.5)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 61(2.4)\n | 78(3.1)\n | 84(3.3)\n | 78(3.1)\n | 66(2.6)\n | 70(2.8)\n | 52(2.0)\n | 51(2.0)\n | 713(28.1)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth cm (inches)\n | 24(9.4)\n | 35(14)\n | 29(11)\n | 2(0.8)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 12(4.7)\n | 35(14)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 8\n | 6\n | 9\n | 15\n | 16\n | 16\n | 15\n | 16\n | 16\n | 17\n | 13\n | 8\n | 155\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 25\n | 23\n | 15\n | 6\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0.3\n | 5\n | 17\n | 24\n | 116\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 85\n | 81\n | 74\n | 68\n | 67\n | 72\n | 74\n | 78\n | 82\n | 83\n | 86\n | 86\n | 78\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 33\n | 72\n | 128\n | 170\n | 265\n | 279\n | 271\n | 238\n | 147\n | 78\n | 32\n | 18\n | 1,731\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 14\n | 27\n | 35\n | 40\n | 53\n | 53\n | 52\n | 51\n | 38\n | 24\n | 13\n | 8\n | 34\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 3\n |\n| Source 1: Pogoda.ru.net,[69][70] Thermograph.ru,[71] Meteoweb.ru (sunshine hours)[72] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[73] |\n\n| Climate data for Moscow (VVC) normals 1961–1990\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −6.3(20.7)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 1.5(34.7)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 1.1(34.0)\n | −3.5(25.7)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −9.3(15.3)\n | −7.7(18.1)\n | −2.2(28.0)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | −6.1(21.0)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −12.3(9.9)\n | −11.1(12.0)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | 1.7(35.1)\n | 7.6(45.7)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 7.1(44.8)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | −3.3(26.1)\n | −8.6(16.5)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n |\n| Source: [74][75][76][77] |\n\nRecent changes in Moscow's regional climate, since it is in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, are often cited by climate scientists as evidence of global warming[*citation needed*], though by definition, climate change is global, not regional. During the summer, extreme heat is often observed in the city (2001, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2011, 2021). Along with a southern part of Central Russia,[78][79] after recent years of hot summer seasons, the climate of the city gets hot-summer classification trends. Winter also became significantly milder: for example, the average January temperature in the early 1900s was −12.0 °C (10.4 °F), while now it is about −7.0 °C (19.4 °F).[80] At the end of January–February it is often colder, with frosts reaching −30.0 °C (−22.0 °F) a few nights per year (2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013).\n\n\nThe last decade was the warmest in the history of meteorological observations of Moscow.

According to Russia's Federal Migration Service, Moscow holds 1.8 million official \"guests\" who have temporary residency on the basis of visas or other documentation, giving a legal population of 14.8 million. The number of Illegal immigrants, the vast majority originating from Central Asia, is estimated to be an additional 1 million people,[92] giving a total population of about 15.8 million.\n\n\n**Vital statistics for 2022:**[93][94]\n\n\n\n* Births: 123,654 (9.8 per 1,000)\n* Deaths: 126,988 (10.1 per 1,000)\n\n\n**Total fertility rate (2022):**[95]   \n\n1.42 children per woman\n\n\n**Life expectancy (2021):**[96]   \n\nTotal — 74.55 years (male — 71.00, female — 77.94)\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in Moscow (2020)[97][98] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Russian Orthodoxy |  | 55% |\n| Atheism and irreligion |  | 28% |\n| Islam |  | 8% |\n| Other religions |  | 3% |\n| Other Christians |  | 2% |\n| Undeclared |  | 4% |\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from left**: the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, demolished during the Soviet period and reconstructed from 1990–2000; Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception; Moscow Cathedral Mosque; and Moscow Choral Synagogue\n\nChristians form the majority of the city's population; most of whom adhere Russian Orthodox Church. The Patriarch of Moscow serves as the head of the church and resides in the Danilov Monastery. Moscow was called the \"city of 40 times 40 churches\"—prior to 1917. Moscow is Russia's capital of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which has been the country's traditional religion.\n\n\nOther religions practiced in Moscow include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Yazidism, and Rodnovery. The Moscow Mufti Council claimed that Muslims numbered around 1.5 million of 10.5 million of the city's population in 2010;[99] There are four mosques in the city.[100]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Moscow\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, a masterpiece of Russian architecture\n![](image)The State Historical Museum, an example of the Neo-Russian style\n![](image)The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, an example of Neo-Byzantine architecture\nMoscow's architecture is world-renowned. Moscow is the site of Saint Basil's Cathedral, with its elegant onion domes, as well as the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the Seven Sisters. The first Kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century.\n\n\nMedieval Moscow's design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares. This layout, as well as Moscow's rivers, helped shape Moscow's design in subsequent centuries.\n\n\nThe Kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century. Its towers and some of its churches were built by Italian architects, lending the city some of the aurae of the renaissance. From the end of the 15th century, the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries, palaces, walls, towers, and churches.\n\n\nThe city's appearance had not changed much by the 18th century. Houses were made of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark. The rebuilding of Moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated by constant fires and the needs of the nobility. Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.[101]\n\n\nFor much of its architectural history, Moscow was dominated by Orthodox churches. However, the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during Soviet times, especially as a result of Joseph Stalin's large-scale effort to \"modernize\" Moscow. Stalin's plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways, some of them over ten lanes wide, which, while greatly simplifying movement through the city, were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts. Among the many casualties of Stalin's demolitions was the Sukharev Tower, a longtime city landmark, as well as mansions and commercial buildings. The city's newfound status as the capital of a deeply secular nation, made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition. Many of the city's churches, which in most cases were some of Moscow's oldest and most prominent buildings, were destroyed; some notable examples include the Kazan Cathedral and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. During the 1990s, both were rebuilt. Many smaller churches, however, were lost.[102]\n\n\n\n![](image)GUM department store, facing the Red Square\n![](image)Ostankino Tower, the tallest freestanding structure in Europe, and the eighth-tallest in the world\nWhile the later Stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation, the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city. Especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with VKHUTEMAS, responsible for such landmarks as Lenin's Mausoleum. Another prominent architect was Vladimir Shukhov, famous for Shukhov Tower, just one of many hyperboloid towers designed by Shukhov. It was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a Russian broadcasting company.[103] Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the Constructivist architecture of early Soviet Russia. He designed spacious elongated shop galleries, most notably the GUM department store on Red Square,[103] bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults.\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the Seven Sisters, Hotel Ukraina, is the tallest hotel in Europe, and one of the tallest hotels in the world.\n![](image)Zhivopisny Bridge, the highest cable-stayed bridge in Europe\nPerhaps the most recognizable contributions of the Stalinist period are the so-called Seven Sisters, seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the Kremlin. A defining feature of Moscow's skyline, their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York City, and their style—with intricate exteriors and a large central spire—has been described as Stalinist Gothic architecture. All seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city; they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the Ostankino Tower, which, when it was completed in 1967, was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world's seventy-second tallest, ranking among buildings such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, Taipei 101 in Taiwan and the CN Tower in Toronto.[104]\n\n\nThe Soviet goal of providing housing for every family, and the rapid growth of Moscow's population, led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power (Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc.). They are usually badly maintained.\n\n\nAlthough the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s, more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall, and have elevators. It is estimated that Moscow has over twice as many elevators as New York City and four times as many as Chicago. Moslift, one of the city's major elevator operating companies, has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call, to release residents trapped in elevators.[105]\n\n\nStalinist-era buildings, mostly found in the central part of the city, are massive and usually ornamented with Socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes. However, small churches—almost always Eastern Orthodox– found across the city provide glimpses of its past. The Old Arbat Street, a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area, preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century. Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city (behind the Stalinist façades of Tverskaya Street, for example) are also examples of bourgeois architecture typical of Tsarist times. Ostankino Palace, Kuskovo, Uzkoye and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era, and some convents, and monasteries, both inside and outside the city, are open to Muscovites and tourists.\n\n\n\n![](image)Modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented in the city for the first time with the ambitious MIBC.\nAttempts are being made to restore many of the city's best-kept examples of pre-Soviet architecture. These restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless façades. There are a few examples of notable, early Soviet avant-garde work too, such as the house of the architect Konstantin Melnikov in the Arbat area. Many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity. Facadism is also widely practiced.[106] Later examples of interesting Soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-Modernist styles employed, such as with the Novy Arbat project, familiarly known as \"false teeth of Moscow\" and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central Moscow involved in the project.\n\n\n\n![](image)Borovitskaya square, Monument to Vladimir the Great and Pashkov House\nPlaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there. Frequently, the plaques are dedicated to Soviet celebrities not well known outside (or often, like with decorated generals and revolutionaries, now both inside) of Russia. There are also many \"museum houses\" of famous Russian writers, composers, and artists in the city.\n\n\nMoscow's skyline is quickly modernizing, with several new towers under construction.\nIn recent years, the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings. As much as a third of historic Moscow has been destroyed in the past few years[107] to make space for luxury apartments and hotels.[108] Other historical buildings, including such landmarks as the 1930 Moskva hotel and the 1913 department store Voyentorg, have been razed and reconstructed anew, with the inevitable loss of historical value. Critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws: in the last 12 years, more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down, several of those dating back to the 17th century.[109] Some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures, which include many works by architect Konstantin Melnikov[110] and Mayakovskaya metro station.\n\n\nSome organizations, such as Moscow Architecture Preservation Society[111] and Save Europe's Heritage,[112] are trying to draw the international public attention to these problems.[113]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Panoramic view of Moscow\n | Panoramic view of Moscow\n |\n\n\n### Parks and landmarks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Moscow tourist attractions\n\n![](image)\nRed Square is a World Heritage Site.\n\nThere are 96 parks and 18 gardens in Moscow, including four botanical gardens. There are 450 square kilometres (170 sq mi) of green zones besides 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi) of forests.[114] Moscow is a very green city, if compared to other cities of comparable size in Western Europe and North America; this is partly due to a history of having green \"yards\" with trees and grass, between residential buildings. There are on average 27 square meters (290 sq ft) of parks per person in Moscow compared with 6 for Paris, 7.5 in London and 8.6 in New York.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gorky Park\nGorky Park (officially the Central Park of Culture and Rest named after Maxim Gorky), was founded in 1928. The main part (689,000 square metres or 170 acres)[115] along the Moskva river contains estrades, children's attractions (including the *Observation Wheel* water ponds with boats and water bicycles), dancing, tennis courts and other sports facilities. It borders the Neskuchny Garden (408,000 square metres or 101 acres), the oldest park in Moscow and a former imperial residence, created as a result of the integration of three estates in the 18th century. The Garden features the Green Theater, one of the largest open amphitheaters in Europe, able to hold up to 15 thousand people.[116] Several parks include a section known as a \"Park of Culture and Rest\", sometimes alongside a much wilder area (this includes parks such as Izmaylovsky, Fili and Sokolniki). Some parks are designated as Forest Parks (lesopark).\n\n\n\n![](image)Dream Island, the largest indoor theme park in Europe\nIzmaylovsky Park, created in 1931, is one of the largest urban parks in the world along with Richmond Park in London. Its area of 15.34 square kilometres (5.92 sq mi) is six times greater than that of Central Park in New York.[115]\n\n\nBauman Garden, officially founded in 1920 and renamed in 1922 after the bolshevik Nikolay Bauman, is one of the oldest parks in Moscow. It is standing on the site of the former Golitsyn estate and eighteenth-century public garden.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Novodevichy Convent is a World Heritage Site. Sokolniki Park, named after the falcon hunting that occurred there in the past, is one of the oldest parks in Moscow and has an area of 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi). A central circle with a large fountain is surrounded by birch, maple, and elm tree alleys. A labyrinth composed of green paths lies beyond the park's ponds.\n\n\nLosiny Ostrov National Park (\"Elk Island\" National Park), with a total area of more than 116 square kilometres (45 sq mi), borders Sokolniki Park and was Russia's first national park. It is quite wild, and is also known as the \"city taiga\" – elk can be seen there.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Church of Ascension in Kolomenskoye is a World Heritage Site.\nTsytsin Main Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences, founded in 1945 is the largest in Europe.[118] It covers the territory of 3.61 square kilometres (1.39 sq mi) bordering the All-Russia Exhibition Center and contains a live exhibition of more than 20 thousand species of plants from around the world, as well as a lab for scientific research. It contains a rosarium with 20 thousand rose bushes, a dendrarium, and an oak forest, with the average age of trees exceeding 100 years. There is a greenhouse taking up more than 5,000 square metres (53,820 square feet) of land.[115]\n\n\nThe All-Russian Exhibition Center (Всероссийский выставочный центр), formerly known as the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV) and later Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (VDNKh), though officially named a \"permanent trade show\", is one of the most prominent examples of Stalinist-era monumental architecture. Among the large spans of a recreational park, areas are scores of elaborate pavilions, each representing either a branch of Soviet industry and science or a USSR republic. Even though during the 1990s it was, and for some part still is, misused as a gigantic shopping center (most of the pavilions are rented out for small businesses), it still retains the bulk of its architectural landmarks, including two monumental fountains (*Stone Flower* and *Friendship of Nations*) and a 360 degrees panoramic cinema. In 2014 the park returned to the name Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, and in the same year, huge renovation works had been started.[119]\n\n\n*Lilac Park*, founded in 1958, has a permanent sculpture display and a large rosarium. Moscow has always been a popular destination for tourists. Some of the more famous attractions include the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site, Moscow Kremlin and Red Square,[120] which was built between the 14th and 17th centuries.[121] The Church of the Ascension at Kolomenskoye, which dates from 1532, is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and another popular attraction.[122]\n\n\nNear the new Tretyakov Gallery there is a sculpture garden, Museon, often called \"the graveyard of fallen monuments\" that displays statues of the former Soviet Union that were removed from their place after its dissolution.\n\n\nOther attractions include the Moscow Zoo, a zoological garden in two sections (the valleys of two streams) linked by a bridge, with nearly a thousand species and more than 6,500 specimens.[123] Each year, the zoo attracts more than 1.2 million visitors.[123] Many of Moscow's parks and landscaped gardens are protected natural environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Zaryadye Park | VDNKh | Victory park on Poklonnaya Hill |\n\n\n## Moscow rings[edit]\n\n\nMoscow's road system is centered roughly on the Kremlin at the heart of the city. From there, roads generally span outwards to intersect with a sequence of circular roads (\"rings\").\n\n\n\n1. The first and innermost major ring, Bulvarnoye Koltso (Boulevard Ring), was built at the former location of the 16th-century city wall around what used to be called Bely Gorod (White Town).[124] The Bulvarnoye Koltso is technically not a ring; it does not form a complete circle, but instead a horseshoe-shaped arc that begins at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and ends at the Yauza River.\n2. The second primary ring, located outside the Boulevard Ring, is the Sadovoye Koltso (Garden Ring). Like the Boulevard Ring, the Garden Ring follows the path of a 16th-century wall that used to encompass part of Moscow.[124] ![](image)Moscow as viewed from the International Space Station, January 29, 2014\n3. The Third Ring Road, was completed in 2003 as a high-speed freeway.\n4. The Fourth Transport Ring, another freeway, was planned, but cancelled in 2011. A system of chordal highways will replace it.\n\n\nAside from the aforementioned hierarchy, line 5 of Moscow Metro is a circle-shaped looped subway line (hence the name *Koltsevaya Liniya*, literally \"ring line\"), which is located between the *Sadovoye Koltso* and Third Transport Ring.\n\n\nTwo modern overlapping lines of Moscow Metro form \"two hearts\":\n\n\n\n* Line 14. Since September 10, 2016, *Moscow Central Circle* renovated railroad (former *Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga*) was introduced as Line 14 of Moscow Metro. The cone-shaped railroad initially opened in 1908 (freight-only railway from 1934 until the 2016 reopening).\n* Line 11. Another circle metro line - *Big Circle Line* (*Bolshaya Koltsevaya Liniya*) is under construction and will be finished in 2023. Kakhovskaya-Savyolovskaya western half of the line was launched in late 2021.\n\n\nThe outermost ring within Moscow is the Moscow Ring Road (often called *MKAD*, acronym word for Russian *Московская Кольцевая Автомобильная Дорога*), which forms the cultural boundary of the city, and was established in the 1950s. It is to note the method of building the road (usage of ground elevation instead of concrete columns throughout the whole way) formed a wall-like barrier that obstacles building roads under the MKAD highway itself).\n\n\n\n* Before 2012 expansion of Moscow, MKAD was considered an approximate border for Moscow boundaries.\n\n\nOutside Moscow, some of the roads encompassing the city continue to follow this circular pattern seen inside city limits, with the notable examples of *Betonka* roads (highways A107 and A108), originally made of concrete pads.\n\n\nIn order to reduce transit traffic on MKAD, the new ring road (called *CKAD* - *Centralnaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga*, *Central Ring Road*) is now under construction beyond the MKAD.\n\n\n\n### Transport rings in Moscow[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Length\n | Name\n | Type\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 km | Boulevard Ring – Bulvarnoye Koltso (not a full ring) | Road\n |\n| 16 km | Garden Ring – Sadovoye Koltso (\"B\") | Road\n |\n| 19 km | Koltsevaya line (Line 5) | Metro\n |\n| 35 km | Third Ring Road – Third Transport Ring – Tretye Transportnoye Koltso (TTK) | Road\n |\n| 54 km | Little Ring of the Moscow Railway, re-opened as Moscow Central Ring (MCC) – Line 14 | Railway\n |\n| 20.2 km | Bolshaya Koltsevaya line – Line 11 | Metro\n |\n| 109 km | Moscow Automobile Ring Road – Moskovskaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga (MKAD) | Road\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Museums and galleries[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the Tretyakov Gallery, which was founded by Pavel Tretyakov, a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city.[125] The Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings. The Old Tretyakov gallery, the original gallery in the Tretyakovskaya area on the south bank of the Moskva River, houses works in the classic Russian tradition.[126] The works of famous pre-Revolutionary painters, such as Ilya Repin, as well as the works of early Russian icon painters can be found here. Visitors can even see rare originals by early 15th-century iconographer Andrei Rublev.[126]\nThe New Tretyakov gallery, created in Soviet times, mainly contains the works of Soviet artists, as well as of a few contemporary paintings, but there is some overlap with the Old Tretyakov Gallery for early 20th-century art. The new gallery includes a small reconstruction of Vladimir Tatlin's famous *Monument to the Third International* and a mixture of other avant-garde works by artists like Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky. Socialist realism features can also be found within the halls of the New Tretyakov Gallery.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts\nAnother art museum in the city of Moscow is the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, which was founded by, among others, the father of Marina Tsvetaeva. The Pushkin Museum is similar to the British Museum in London in that its halls are a cross-section of exhibits on world civilisations, with many copies of ancient sculptures. However, it also hosts paintings from every major Western era; works by Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, and Pablo Picasso are present in the museum's collection.\n\n\nThe State Historical Museum of Russia (Государственный Исторический музей) is a museum of Russian history located between Red Square and Manege Square in Moscow. Its exhibitions range from relics of the prehistoric tribes inhabiting present-day Russia, through priceless artworks acquired by members of the Romanov dynasty. The total number of objects in the museum's collection numbers is several million. The Polytechnical Museum,[127] founded in 1872 is the largest technical museum in Russia, offering a wide array of historical inventions and technological achievements, including humanoid automata from the 18th century and the first Soviet computers. Its collection contains more than 160,000 items.[128] The Borodino Panorama[129] museum located on Kutuzov Avenue provides an opportunity for visitors to experience being on a battlefield with a 360° diorama. It is a part of the large historical memorial commemorating the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 over Napoleon's army, that includes also the triumphal arch, erected in 1827. There is also a military history museum that includes statues, and military hardware.\nMemorial Museum of Cosmonautics under the Monument to the Conquerors of Space at the end of Cosmonauts Alley is the central memorial place for the Russian space officials.\n\n\nThe Shchusev State Museum of Architecture is the national museum of Russian architecture by the name of the architect Alexey Shchusev near the Kremlin area.\n\n\nMoscow will get its own branch of the Hermitage Museum in 2024, with authorities having agreed upon the final project, to be executed by Hani Rashid, co-founder of New York-based 'Asymptote Architecture' - the same bureau that's behind the city's stock market building, the Busan-based World Business Center Solomon Tower and the Strata Tower in Abu-Dhabi.[130]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Bolshoi Theatre\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMoscow is the heart of the Russian performing arts, including ballet and film, with 68 museums[131] 103[132] theaters, 132 cinemas and 24 concert halls. Among Moscow's theaters and ballet studios is the Bolshoi Theatre and the Malyi Theatre[133] as well as Vakhtangov Theatre and Moscow Art Theatre.\n\n\nThe Moscow International Performance Arts Center,[134] opened in 2003, also known as Moscow International House of Music, is known for its performances in classical music. It has the largest organ in Russia installed in Svetlanov Hall.\n\n\nThere are also two large circuses in Moscow: Moscow State Circus and Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard[135] named after Yuri Nikulin.\n\n\nThe Mosfilm studio was at the heart of many classic films, as it is responsible for both artistic and mainstream productions.[136] However, despite the continued presence and reputation of internationally renowned Russian filmmakers, the once prolific native studios are much quieter. Rare and historical films may be seen in the Salut cinema, where films from the Museum of Cinema[137] collection are shown regularly. International film festivals such as the Moscow International Film Festival, Stalker, Artdocfest, and Moscow Jewish Film Festival are staged in Moscow.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Football in Moscow\n\n![](image)The Luzhniki Stadium hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics and the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.\n![](image)Sparrow Hills fanzone during 2018 FIFA World Cup\n![](image)SC Olimpiyskiy was built for the 1980 Summer Olympics.\nOver 500 Olympic sports champions lived in the city by 2005.[138] Moscow is home to 63 stadiums (besides eight football and eleven light athletics maneges), of which Luzhniki Stadium is the largest and the 4th biggest in Europe (it hosted the 1998–99 UEFA Cup, 2007–08 UEFA Champions League finals, the 1980 Summer Olympics, and the 2018 FIFA World Cup with 7 games total, including the final). Forty other sports complexes are located within the city, including 24 with artificial ice. The Olympic Stadium was the world's first indoor arena for bandy and hosted the Bandy World Championship twice.[139] Moscow was again the host of the competition in 2010, this time in Krylatskoye.[140] That arena has also hosted the World Speed Skating Championships. There are also seven horse racing tracks in Moscow,[114] of which Central Moscow Hippodrome,[141] founded in 1834, is the largest.\n\n\n\n![](image)CSKA Arena during a game of KHL, considered to be the second-best ice hockey league in the world\nMoscow was the host city of the 1980 Summer Olympics, with the yachting events being held at Tallinn, in present-day Estonia. Large sports facilities and the main international airport, Sheremetyevo Terminal 2, were built in preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Moscow had made a bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. However, when final voting commenced on July 6, 2005, Moscow was the first city to be eliminated from further rounds. The Games were awarded to London.\n\n\nThe most titled ice hockey team in the Soviet Union and in the world, HC CSKA Moscow comes from Moscow. Other big ice hockey clubs from Moscow are HC Dynamo Moscow, which was the second most titled team in the Soviet Union, and HC Spartak Moscow.\n\n\nThe most titled Soviet, Russian, and one of the most titled Euroleague clubs, is the basketball club from Moscow PBC CSKA Moscow. Moscow hosted the EuroBasket in 1953 and 1965.\n\n\nMoscow had more winners at the USSR and Russian Chess Championship than any other city.\n\n\nThe most titled volleyball team in the Soviet Union and in Europe (CEV Champions League) is VC CSKA Moscow.\n\n\nIn football, FC Spartak Moscow has won more championship titles in the Russian Premier League than any other team. They were second only to FC Dynamo Kyiv in Soviet times. PFC CSKA Moscow became the first Russian football team to win a UEFA title, the UEFA Cup (present-day UEFA Europa League). FC Lokomotiv Moscow, FC Dynamo Moscow and FC Torpedo Moscow are other professional football teams also based in Moscow.\n\n\n\n* ![Otkrytiye Arena, home of FC Spartak Moscow](image)\n\nOtkrytiye Arena, home of FC Spartak Moscow\n* ![VEB Arena, home of PFC CSKA Moscow](image)\n\nVEB Arena, home of PFC CSKA Moscow\n* ![VTB Arena, home of FC Dynamo Moscow and HC Dynamo Moscow](image)\n\nVTB Arena, home of FC Dynamo Moscow and HC Dynamo Moscow\n* ![RZD Arena, home of FC Lokomotiv Moscow](image)\n\nRZD Arena, home of FC Lokomotiv Moscow\n\n\nMoscow houses other prominent football, ice hockey, and basketball teams. Because sports organisations in the Soviet Union were once highly centralized, two of the best Union-level teams represented defence and law-enforcing agencies: the Armed Forces (CSKA) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Dinamo). There were army and police teams in most major cities. As a result, Spartak, CSKA, and Dinamo were among the best-funded teams in the USSR.\n\n\nThe Irina Viner-Usmanova Gymnastics Palace is located in the Luzniki Olympic Complex. The building works started in 2017 and the opening ceremony took place on June 18, 2019. The investor of the Palace is the billionaire Alisher Usmanov, husband of the former gymnast and gymnastics coach Irina Viner-Usmanova. The total surface of the building is 23,500 m2, which include 3 fitness rooms, locker rooms, rooms reserved for referees and coaches, saunas, a canteen, a cafeteria, 2 ball halls, a Medical center, a hall reserved for journalists, and a hotel for athletes.[142]\n\n\nBecause of Moscow's cold local climate, winter sports have a following. Many of Moscow's large parks offer marked trails for skiing and frozen ponds for skating.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, which hosted games of the 2018 FIFA World Cup\nMoscow hosts the annual Kremlin Cup, a popular tennis tournament on both the WTA and ATP tours. It is one of the ten Tier-I events on the women's tour and a host of Russian players feature every year.\n\n\nSC Olimpiyskiy hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, the first and so far the only Eurovision Song Contest arranged in Russia.\n\n\nSlava Moscow is a professional rugby club, competing in the national Professional Rugby League. Former rugby league heavyweights RC Lokomotiv have entered the same league as of 2011[update]. The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens.\n\n\nIn bandy, one of the most successful clubs in the world is 20 times Russian League champions Dynamo Moscow. They have also won the World Cup thrice and European Cup six times.\n\n\nMFK Dinamo Moskva is one of the major futsal clubs in Europe, having won the Futsal Champions League title once.\n\n\nWhen Russia was selected to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the Luzhniki Stadium got an increased capacity, by almost 10,000 new seats, in addition to a further two stadiums that have been built: the Dynamo Stadium, and the Spartak Stadium, although the first one later was dismissed from having World Cup matches.\n\n\n\n### Football clubs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Club | Founded | League | League Rank | Stadium\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spartak Moscow | 1922 | Premier League | 1st | Otkrytiye Arena |\n| CSKA Moscow | 1911 | Premier League | 1st | VEB Arena |\n| Lokomotiv Moscow | 1923 | Premier League | 1st | RZD Arena |\n| Dynamo Moscow | 1923 | Premier League | 1st | VTB Arena |\n| Torpedo Moscow | 1924 | First League | 2nd | Eduard Streltsov Stadium |\n| Rodina Moscow | 2015 | First League | 2nd | Spartakovets Stadium\n |\n| Veles Moscow | 2016 | Second League | 3rd | Avangard Stadium\n |\n\n\n## Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of shopping malls in Moscow\n\n![](image)Arbat Street, in the historical centre of Moscow\nThe city is full of clubs, restaurants, and bars. Tverskaya Street is also one of the busiest shopping streets in Moscow.\n\n\nThe adjoining Tretyakovsky Proyezd, also south of Tverskaya Street, in Kitai-gorod, is host to upmarket boutique stores such as Bulgari, Tiffany & Co., Armani, Prada and Bentley.[143] Nightlife in Moscow has moved on since Soviet times and today the city has many of the world's largest nightclubs.[144] Clubs, bars, creative spaces and restaurants-turned-into-dancefloors are flooding Moscow streets with new openings every year. The hottest area is located around the old chocolate factory, where bars, nightclubs, galleries, cafés and restaurants are placed.[145]\n\n\nDream Island is an amusement park in Moscow that opened on February 29, 2020.[146][147] It is the largest indoor theme park in Europe.\nThe park covers 300,000 square meters. During the park's construction, 150 acres of nature trees unique and rare animals and birds and plants on the peninsula were destroyed. The appearance is in the style of a fairytale castle similar to Disneyland. The park has 29 unique attractions with many rides, as well as pedestrian malls with fountains and cycle paths. The complex includes a landscaped park along with a concert hall, a cinema, a hotel, a children's sailing school, restaurants, and shops.\n\n\n\n## Authorities[edit]\n\n\n### Moscow authorities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Government of Moscow, Mayor of Moscow, Moscow City Duma, and Charter of the city of Moscow\n\n![](image)Government of Moscow\nAccording to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Moscow is an independent federal subject of the Russian Federation, the so-called city of federal importance.\n\n\nThe Mayor of Moscow is the leading official in the executive, leading the Government of Moscow, which is the highest organ of executive power.\nThe Moscow City Duma is the City Duma (city council or local parliament) and local laws must be approved by it. It includes 45 members who are elected for a five-year term on Single-mandate constituency basis.\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2012, direct elections of the mayor were not held due to changes in the Charter of the city of Moscow, the mayor was appointed by presidential decree. The first direct elections from the time of the 2003 vote were to be held after the expiration of the current mayor in 2015, however, in connection with his resignation of his own free will, they took place in September 2013.\n\n\nLocal administration is carried out through eleven prefectures, uniting the districts of Moscow into administrative districts on a territorial basis, and 125 regional administrations. According to the law \"On the organization of local self-government in the city of Moscow\", since the beginning of 2003, the executive bodies of local self-government are municipalities, representative bodies are municipal assemblies, whose members are elected in accordance with the Charter of the intracity municipality.\n\n\n\n### Federal authorities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: White House (Moscow) and State Duma\n\n![](image)The House of the Government of the Russian Federation\nIn Moscow, as in a city endowed with the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the legislative, executive, and judicial federal authorities of the country are located, with the exception of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, which has been located in Saint Petersburg since 2008.\n\n\nThe supreme executive authority - the Government of the Russian Federation - is located in the House of the Government of the Russian Federation on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment in the center of Moscow. The State Duma sits on Okhotny Ryad. The Federation Council is located in a building on Bolshaya Dmitrovka. The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and the Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Russian Federation are also located in Moscow.\n\n\nIn addition, the Moscow Kremlin is the official residence of the President of the Russian Federation. The president's working residence in the Kremlin is located in the Senate Palace.\n\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A BMW 5 Series of the Moscow Police on patrol\nAccording to the ranking of the safest cities made by The Economist Moscow occupies the 37th position with a score of 68,5 points percent.[148] The general level of crime is quite low.[149] More than 170,000 surveillance cameras in Moscow are connected to the facial recognition system. The authorities recognized the successful two-month experiment with automatic recognition of faces, gender, and age of people in real-time - and then they deployed the system to the whole city. The network of video surveillance unites access video cameras (95% of residential apartment buildings in the capital), cameras in the territory and in buildings of schools and kindergartens, at the MCC stations, stadiums, public transport stops, and bus stations, in parks, underground passages.[150]\n\n\nThe emergency numbers are the same as in all the other regions of Russia: 112 is the Single Emergency Number, 101 is the number of the Fire Service and Ministry of Emergency Situations, 102 is the Police one, 103 is the ambulance one, 104 is the Emergency Gas number.[151] Moscow's EMS is the second most efficient one among the world's megacities, as reported by PwC during the presentation of the international study Analysis of EMS Efficiency in Megacities of the World.[152]\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Moscow\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Federal city of Moscow\n | ![Coat of arms of Moscow](image) |\n| **City administrative divisions** | 12\n |\n| **City districts** | 125\n |\n| **City settlements** | 21\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Moscow is divided into **12 administrative districts**:\n | ![](image) |\n| 1.

Troitsky Administrative Okrug\n |\n\n\n![](image)Territorial change of Moscow from 1922 to 1995\nThe entire city of Moscow is headed by one mayor (Sergey Sobyanin). The city of Moscow is divided into twelve administrative okrugs and 125 districts.\n\n\nThe Russian capital's town-planning development began to show as early as the 12th century when the city was founded. The central part of Moscow grew by consolidating with suburbs in line with medieval principles of urban development when strong fortress walls would gradually spread along the circle streets of adjacent new settlements. The first circular defence walls set the trajectory of Moscow's rings, laying the groundwork for the future planning of the Russian capital.\n\n\nThe following fortifications served as the city's circular defense boundaries at some point in history: the Kremlin walls, Zemlyanoy Gorod (Earthwork Town), the Kamer-Kollezhsky Rampart, the Garden Ring, and the small railway ring. The Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) has been Moscow's boundary since 1960. Also in the form of a circle are the main Moscow subway line, the Ring Line, and the so-called Third Automobile Ring, which was completed in 2005. Hence, the characteristic radial-circle planning continues to define Moscow's further development. However, contemporary Moscow has also engulfed a number of territories outside the MKAD, such as Solntsevo, Butovo, and the town of Zelenograd. A part of Moscow Oblast's territory was merged into Moscow on July 1, 2012; as a result, Moscow is no longer fully surrounded by Moscow Oblast and now also has a border with Kaluga Oblast.[153] In all, Moscow gained about 1,500 square kilometers (580 sq mi) and 230,000 inhabitants. Moscow's Mayor Sergey Sobyanin lauded the expansion that will help Moscow and the neighboring region, a \"mega-city\" of twenty million people, to develop \"harmonically\".[57]\n\n\nAll administrative okrugs and districts have their own coats of arms and flags as well as individual heads of the area.\n\n\nIn addition to the districts, there are Territorial Units with Special Status. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations. Such is the case with the All-Russia Exhibition Centre, the Botanical Garden, large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different districts. There are no ethnic-specific regions in Moscow, as in the Chinatowns that exist in some North American and East Asian cities. And although districts are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city center, metro stations or green zones are considered more prestigious.[154]\n\n\nMoscow also hosts some of the government bodies of Moscow Oblast, although the city itself is not a part of the oblast.[155]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Russia\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Largest private companies basedin Moscow** (ranked by 2019 revenues) |\n| **Moscow** |  | **corporation** |  | **Russia** |\n| 1 |  | Lukoil |  | 1\n |\n| 2 |  | X5 Retail Group |  | 3\n |\n| 3 |  | Novatek |  | 6\n |\n| 4 |  | Nornickel |  | 9\n |\n| 5 |  | UC Rusal |  | 11\n |\n| 6 |  | Sibur |  | 13\n |\n| 7 |  | SUEK |  | 15\n |\n| 8 |  | MTS |  | 17\n |\n| 9 |  | Metalloinvest |  | 18\n |\n| 10 |  | EuroChem |  | 21\n |\n| 11 |  | MegaFon |  | 22\n |\n| 12 |  | M.video |  | 24\n |\n| 13 |  | TMK |  | 25\n |\n| 14 |  | Mechel |  | 26\n |\n| **Source:** *Forbes*[156] |\n\n\n![](image)Moscow International Business Center, one of the largest financial centres of Europe and the world\nMoscow has one of the largest municipal economies in Europe and it accounts more than one-fifth of Russia's gross domestic product (GDP).[157] As of 2021[update], the GRP of Moscow reached almost ₽24.5 trillion(US$332 billion).[158] GMP of Moscow Region was ₽31.3 trillion or around US$425 billion.\n\n\n\n![](image)Moscow Exchange\nThe average gross monthly wage in the city is ₽123,688[159] (US$2,000), which is around twice the national average of ₽66,572 (US$1,000), and one of the highest among the federal subjects of Russia.\n\n\nMoscow is home to the third-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world,[160] and has the highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe. It is the financial center of Russia and home to the country's largest banks and many of its largest companies, such as oil giant Rosneft. Moscow accounts for 17% of retail sales in Russia and for 13% of all construction activity in the country.[161][162] Since the 1998 Russian financial crisis, business sectors in Moscow have shown exponential rates of growth. Many new business centers and office buildings have been built in recent years, but Moscow still experiences shortages in office space. As a result, many former industrial and research facilities are being reconstructed to become suitable for office use. Overall, economic stability has improved in recent years; nonetheless, crime and corruption still hinder business development.\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nPrimary industries in Moscow include the chemical, metallurgy, food, textile, furniture, energy production, software development and machinery industries.\n\n\nThe Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant is one of the world's leading producers of military and civil helicopters. Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center produces various space equipment, including modules for space stations Mir, Salyut and the ISS as well as Proton launch vehicles and military ICBMs. Sukhoi, Ilyushin, Mikoyan, Tupolev and Yakovlev aircraft design bureaus also situated in Moscow. NPO Energomash, producing the rocket engines for Russian and American space programs, as well as Lavochkin design bureau, which built fighter planes during WWII, but switched to space probes since the Space Race, are in nearby Khimki, an independent city in Moscow Oblast that have largely been enclosed by Moscow from its sides. Automobile plants ZiL and AZLK, as well as the Voitovich Rail Vehicle plant, are situated in Moscow and Metrovagonmash metro wagon plant is located just outside the city limits. The Poljot Moscow watch factory produces military, professional and sport watches well known in Russia and abroad. Yuri Gagarin in his trip into space used \"Shturmanskie\" produced by this factory.\n\n\nThe Electrozavod factory was the first transformer factory in Russia. The Kristall distillery[163] is the oldest distillery in Russia producing vodka types, including \"Stolichnaya\" while wines are produced at Moscow wine plants, including the Moscow Interrepublican Vinery.[164] The Moscow Jewelry Factory[165] and the Jewellerprom[166] are producers of jewelry in Russia; Jewellerprom used to produce the exclusive Order of Victory, awarded to those aiding the Soviet Union's Red Army during World War II.\n\n\nThere are other industries located just outside the city of Moscow, as well as microelectronic industries in Zelenograd, including Ruselectronics companies.\n\n\nGazprom, the largest extractor of natural gas in the world and the largest Russian company, has head offices also in Moscow, as well as other oil, gas, and electricity companies.\n\n\nMoscow hosts headquarters of the many of telecommunication and technology companies, including 1C, ABBYY, Beeline, Kaspersky Lab, Mail.Ru Group, MegaFon, MTS, Rambler&Co, Rostelecom, Yandex, and Yota.\n\n\nSome industry is being transferred out of the city to improve the ecological state of the city.\n\n\n\n### Cost of living[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hotels in Moscow\n\n![](image)Tretyakovsky Proyezd\n![](image)Nikolskaya Street\n![](image)A microdistrict in Mitino built in the 1990s\nDuring Soviet times, apartments were lent to people by the government according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes, and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors). Private ownership of apartments was limited until the 1990s when people were permitted to secure property rights to their inhabited places. Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area.\n\n\nThe price of real estate in Moscow continues to rise. Today, one could expect to pay $4,000 on average per square meter (11 sq ft) on the outskirts of the city[167] or US$6,500–$8,000 per square meter in a prestigious district. The price sometimes may exceed US$40,000 per square meter in a flat.[168][169][170] It costs about US$1,200 per month to rent a one-bedroom apartment and about US$1,000 per month for a studio in the center of Moscow.\n\n\nA typical one-bedroom apartment is about thirty square metres (320 square feet), a typical two-bedroom apartment is forty-five square metres (480 square feet), and a typical three-bedroom apartment is seventy square metres (750 square feet). Many cannot move out of their apartments, especially if a family lives in a two-room apartment originally granted by the state during the Soviet era. Some city residents have attempted to cope with the cost of living by renting their apartments while staying in dachas (country houses) outside the city.\n\n\nIn 2006, Mercer Human Resources Consulting named Moscow the world's most expensive city for expatriate employees, ahead of perennial winner Tokyo, due to the stable Russian ruble as well as increasing housing prices within the city.[171] Moscow also ranked first in the 2007 edition and 2008 edition of the survey. However, Tokyo has overtaken Moscow as the most expensive city in the world, placing Moscow at third behind Osaka in second place.[172]\n\n\nIn 2008, Moscow ranked top on the list of most expensive cities for the third year in a row.[173]\n\n\nIn 2014, according to *Forbes*, Moscow was ranked the 9th most expensive city in the world. *Forbes* ranked Moscow the 2nd most expensive city the year prior.[174]\n\n\nIn 2019 the Economist Intelligence Unit's Worldwide Cost of Living survey put Moscow to 102nd place in the biannual ranking of 133 most expensive cities.[175] ECA International's Cost of Living 2019 Survey ranked Moscow at number 120 among 482 locations worldwide.[176]\n\n\n\n### Public utilities[edit]\n\n\n#### Heating[edit]\n\n\nThe heating of buildings in Moscow, like in other cities in Russia is done using central heating system. Before 2004, state unitary enterprises were responsible to produce and supply heat to the clients by the operation of heating stations and heating distribution system of Mosgorteplo, Mosteploenergo, and Teploremontnaladka which gave service to the heating substations in the north-eastern part of the city. Clients were divided between the various enterprises based on their geographical location. A major reform launched in 2004 consolidated the various companies under the umbrella of MIPC which became the municipal heat supplier. Its subsidiaries were the newly transformed Joint-stock companies. The city's main source of heating is the power station of Mosenergo which was reformed in 2005, when around ten subsidiaries were separated from it. One of the newly independent companies was the District Heating Network Company (MTK) (Russian: Московская теплосетевая компания). In 2007 the Government of Moscow bought controlling stakes in the company.[177]\n\n\n\n#### City services[edit]\n\n\n\"Our city\" is a geo-information portal created in 2011 under the mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin with the aim of building a constructive dialogue between Moscow residents and the city's executive authorities. The portal is being developed by the State Public Institution \"New Management Technologies\" together with the Moscow Department of Information Technologies. In its 10 years of operation, more than 1.7 million users have joined the portal, and during this time it has become an effective tool for monitoring the state of urban infrastructure.[178]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Russia\n\n![](image)Moscow State University\nThere are 1,696 high schools in Moscow, as well as 91 colleges.[114] Besides these, there are 222 institutions of higher education, including 60 state universities[114] and the Lomonosov Moscow State University, which was founded in 1755.[179] The main university building located in Vorobyovy Gory (Sparrow Hills) is 240 metres (790 ft) tall and when completed, was the tallest building on the continent.[180] The university has over 30,000 undergraduate and 7,000 postgraduate students, who have a choice of twenty-nine faculties and 450 departments for study. Additionally, approximately 10,000 high school students take courses at the university, while over two thousand researchers work. The Moscow State University library contains over nine million books, making it one of the largest libraries in all of Russia. Its acclaim throughout the international academic community has meant that over 11,000 international students have graduated from the university, with many coming to Moscow to become fluent in the Russian language.[181]\n\n\nThe I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University named after Ivan Sechenov or formerly known as Moscow Medical Academy (1stMSMU) is a medical university situated in Moscow, Russia. It was founded in 1785 as the faculty of the Moscow State University. It is a Russian Federal Agency for Health and Social Development. It is one of the largest medical universities in Russia and Europe. More than 9200 students are enrolled in 115 academic departments. It offers courses for post-graduate studies.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University\nThe Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University (formerly known as Russian State Medical University) is a medical higher education institution in Moscow, Russia founded in 1906. It is fully accredited and recognized by Russia's Ministry of Education and Science and is currently under the authority of the Ministry of Health and Social Development. Named after Russian surgeon and pedagogue N.I. Pirogov (1810-1888), it is one of the largest medical institutions and the first university in Russia to allow women to acquire degrees.\n\n\nMoscow is one of the financial centers of the Russian Federation and CIS countries and is known for its business schools. Among them are the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; The State University of Management, and the National Research University - Higher School of Economics. They offer undergraduate degrees in management, finance, accounting, marketing, real estate, and economic theory, as well as Masters programs and MBAs. Most of them have branches in other regions of Russia and countries around the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)The main building of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University\nBauman Moscow State Technical University, founded in 1830, is located in the center of Moscow and provides 18,000 undergraduate and 1,000 postgraduate students with an education in science and engineering, offering technical degrees.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Moscow Conservatory building\nThe Moscow Conservatory,[183] founded in 1866, is a prominent music school in Russia whose graduates include Sergey Rachmaninoff, Alexander Scriabin, Aram Khachaturian, Mstislav Rostropovich, and Alfred Schnittke.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Russian State Institute of Cinematography, the world's oldest  \nfilm school\nThe Gerasimov All-Russian State Institute of Cinematography, abbreviated as VGIK, is the world's oldest educational institution in Cinematography, founded by Vladimir Gardin in 1919.\nSergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Aleksey Batalov were among its most distinguished professors and Mikhail Vartanov, Sergei Parajanov, Andrei Tarkovsky, Nikita Mikhalkov, Eldar Ryazanov, Alexander Sokurov, Yuriy Norshteyn, Aleksandr Petrov, Vasily Shukshin, Konrad Wolf among graduates.\n\n\nMoscow State Institute of International Relations, founded in 1944, remains Russia's best- known school of international relations and diplomacy, with six schools focused on international relations. Approximately 4,500 students make up the university's student body and over 700,000 Russian and foreign-language books—of which 20,000 are considered rare—can be found in the library of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.[184]\n\n\nOther institutions are the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, also known as Phystech, the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov, the Moscow Aviation Institute, the Moscow Motorway Institute (State Technical University), and the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology has taught numerous Nobel Prize winners, including Pyotr Kapitsa, Nikolay Semyonov, Lev Landau and Alexander Prokhorov, while the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute is known for its research in nuclear physics.[185] The highest Russian military school is the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.\n\n\nAlthough Moscow has a number of famous Soviet-era higher educational institutions, most of which are more oriented towards engineering or the fundamental sciences, in recent years Moscow has seen a growth in the number of commercial and private institutions that offer classes in business and management. Many state institutions have expanded their education scope and introduced new courses or departments. Institutions in Moscow, as well as the rest of post-Soviet Russia, have begun to offer new international certificates and postgraduate degrees, including the Master of Business Administration. Student exchange programs with numerous countries, specially with the rest of Europe, have also become widespread in Moscow's universities, while schools within the Russian capital also offer seminars, lectures, and courses for corporate employees and businessmen.\n\n\n\n![](image)Russian Academy of Sciences\nMoscow is one of the largest science centers in Russia. The headquarters of the Russian Academy of Sciences are located in Moscow as well as research and applied science institutions. The Kurchatov Institute, Russia's leading research and development institution in the fields of nuclear energy, where the first nuclear reactor in Europe was built, the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics, Kapitza Institute for Physical Problems and Steklov Institute of Mathematics are all situated in Moscow.\n\n\nThere are 452 libraries in the city, including 168 for children.[114] The Russian State Library,[186] founded in 1862, is the national library of Russia. The library is home to over 275 km (171 mi) of shelves and 42 million items, including over 17 million books and serial volumes, 13 million journals, 350,000 music scores and sound records, and 150,000 maps, making it the largest library in Russia and one of the largest in the world. Items in 247 languages account for 29% of the collection.[187][188]\n\n\nThe State Public Historical Library, founded in 1863, is the largest library specialising in Russian history. Its collection contains four million items in 112 languages (including 47 languages of the former USSR), mostly on Russian and world history, heraldry, numismatics, and the history of science.[189]\n\n\nIn regard to primary and secondary education, in 2011, Clifford J. Levy of *The New York Times* wrote, \"Moscow has some strong public schools, but the system as a whole is dispiriting, in part because it is being corroded by the corruption that is a post-Soviet scourge. Parents often pay bribes to get their children admitted to better public schools. There are additional payoffs for good grades.\"[190]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Moscow\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Metro\n\n![](image)Moscow Metro route map with planned stations\n![](image)Mayakovskaya station, opened in 1938\nThe Moscow Metro system is famous for its art, murals, mosaics, and ornate chandeliers. It started operation in 1935 and immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and reward the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Lazar Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilisation as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new \"Homo Sovieticus\" (Soviet man).[191]\n\n\nThe metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order—a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.[192] Soviet workers did the labour and the artwork, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground. The Britons called for tunneling instead of the \"cut-and-cover\" technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, and designed the routes and the rolling stock.[193] The paranoia of Stalin and the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage—that is for gaining an in-depth knowledge of the city's physical layout. Engineers for the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company were given a show trial and deported in 1933, ending the role of British business in the USSR.[194]\n\n\nToday, the Moscow Metro comprises twelve lines, mostly underground with a total of 203 stations. The Metro is one of the deepest subway systems in the world; for instance, the Park Pobedy station, completed in 2003, at 84 metres (276 ft) underground, has the longest escalators in Europe. The Moscow Metro is the busiest metro system in Europe, as well as one of the world's busiest metro systems, serving about ten million passengers daily (300,000,000 people every month).[195] Facing serious transportation problems, Moscow has plans for expanding its Metro. In 2016, the authorities launched a new circle metro railway that contributed to solving transportation issues, namely daily congestion at Koltsevaya Line.[196]\n\n\nDue to the treatment of Metro stations as possible canvas for art, characterized by the fact that workers of Moscow would get to see them every day, many Stalin-era metro stations were built in different \"custom\" designs (where each station's design would be, initially, a massive installation on a certain theme. For example, Elektrozavodskaya station was themed solely after nearby lightbulb factory and ceramic ribbed lightbulb sockets);[197] the tradition of \"Grand Designs\" and, basically, decorating metro stations as single-themed installations, was restored in late 1979.\n\n\nMore recently, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin has introduced comforts ranging from WiFi and USB ports and Apple Pay — while opening new stations at a breakneck pace. Moscow's metro is one of the world's busiest, handling 2.6 billion passengers in 2019.[198]\n\n\nIn the Russian capital, there are over 21.5 thousand Wi-Fi access points, in student dormitories, in parks, cultural and sports institutions, and within the Garden Ring and the Third Transport Ring. From September 2020 to August 2021, 1,700 new access points to urban Wi-Fi were launched in Moscow.[199] The structure of the Wi-Fi network allows citizens to use the Internet without re-authorization.[200]\n\n\n\n### Monorail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Monorail\n\n![](image)Two trains of the Moscow Monorail\nThe Moscow Metro operates a short monorail line (line 13). The line connects Timiryazevskaya metro station and Ulitsa Sergeya Eisensteina, passing close to VDNH (and Line 6 Metro station \"V.D.N.Kh.\"). The line opened in 2004. It accepts overground interchanges, no additional fare is needed if a ride was spent at Moscow Metro within previous 90 minutes.\n\n\n\n### Bus, trolleybus and electric bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electric buses in Moscow\n\n![](image)Moscow has the largest fleet of electric buses in Europe, with 500 operating as of October 2020[update].[201]\nAs Metro stations outside the city center are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to 4 kilometres (2.5 mi), a bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones. Moscow has a bus terminal for long-range and intercity passenger buses (Central Bus Terminal) with a daily turnover of about 25 thousand passengers serving about 40% of long-range bus routes in Moscow.[202]\n\n\nEvery major street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by a trolleybus route and have trolley wires over them.\n\n\nWith the total line length of almost 600 kilometres (370 miles) of a single wire, 8 depots, 104 routes, and 1740 vehicles, the Moscow trolleybus system was the largest in the world. But municipal authority, headed by Sergey Sobyanin, began to destroy the trolleybus system in Moscow in 2014 due the planned replacement of trolleybuses by electric buses. In 2018 Moscow trolleybus system has only 4 depots and dozens of kilometers of unused wires. Almost all trolleybus wires inside Garden Ring (Sadovoe Koltso) were cut in 2016–2017 due to the reconstruction of central streets (\"Moya Ulitsa\"). Opened on November 15, 1933, it is also the world's 6th oldest operating trolleybus system.\n\n\nIn 2018 the vehicle companies Kamaz and GAZ have won the Mosgortrans tender for delivering 200 electric buses and 62 ultra-fast charging stations to the city transport system. The manufacturers will be responsible for the quality and reliable operation of the buses and charging stations for the next 15 years. The city will be procuring only electric buses as of 2021, replacing the diesel bus fleet gradually. According to expectations, Moscow will become the leader amongst the European cities in terms of electric and gas fuel share in public transport by 2019.[203]\n\n\nAll bus stations and terminals of Moscow are now connected to free Wi-Fi. One may use it in international bus stations Salaryevo, South Gate and North Gate, and in bus terminals Varshavskaya and Orekhovo. As much as 48 hot spots were installed there.[204]\n\n\n\n### Moscow cable car[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moskva River cable car\n\n![](image)Cable cars passing across the Moskva River and the Luzhniki Stadium\nOn November 26, 2018, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin took part in the ceremony to open the cable car above the Moskva River. The cable car will connect the Luzhniki sports complex with Sparrow Hills and Kosygin Street.\n\n\nThe journey from the well-known viewpoint on Vorobyovy Gory to Luzhniki Stadium will last for five minutes instead of 20 minutes that one would have to spend on the same journey by car. The cable car will work every day from 11 a.m. till 11 p.m.\n\n\nThe cable car is 720 meters (2,360 ft) long. It was built to transport 1,600 passengers per hour in all weathers. There are 35 closed capsules designed by Porsche Design Studio to transport passengers. The booths are equipped with media screens, LED lights, hooks for bikes, skis, and snowboards. Passengers will also be able to use audio guides in English, German, Chinese and Russian.\n\n\n\n### Tram[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Trams in Moscow\n\n![](image)A Vityaz-M tram passing by the Tverskaya Zastava Square\nMoscow has an extensive tram system, which first opened in 1899.[205] The newest line was built in 1984. Its daily usage by Muscovites is low, making up for approximately 5% of trips because many vital connections in the network have been withdrawn. Trams still remain important in some districts as feeders to Metro stations. The trams also provide important cross-links between metro lines, for example between Universitet station of Sokolnicheskaya Line (#1 red line) and Profsoyuznaya station of Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line (#6 orange line) or between Voykovskaya and Strogino. Some routes used to connect downtown with sleep districts, like route 3.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tram map of Moscow\nThere are three tram networks in the city:\n\n\n\n* Krasnopresnenskoye depot network with the westernmost point at Strogino (depot location) and the easternmost point near platform Dmitrovskaya. This network became separated in 1973, but until 1997 it could easily have been reconnected by about one kilometre (fifty chains) of track and three switches. The network has the highest usage in Moscow and no weak points based on turnover except to-depot lane (passengers serviced by bus) and tram ring at Dmitrovskaya (because now it is neither a normal transfer point nor a repair terminal).\n* The Apakov depot services the south-western part from the Varshavsky lane – Simferopolsky boulevard in the east to the Universitet station in the west and Boulevard lane at the center. This network is connected only by the four-way Dubininskaya and Kozhevnicheskaya streets. A second connection by Vostochnaya (Eastern) street was withdrawn in 1987 due to a fire at the Dinamo plant and has not been recovered, and remains lost (Avtozavodsky bridge) at 1992. The network may be serviced anyway by another depot (now route 35, 38).\n* Main three depot networks with railway gate and tram-repair plant.\n\n\nIn addition, tram advocates have suggested that the new rapid transit services (metro to City, Butovo light metro, Monorail) would be more effective as at-grade tram lines and that the problems with trams are only due to poor management and operation, not the technical properties of trams. New tram models have been developed for the Moscow network despite the lack of expansion.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nCommercial taxi services and route taxis are in widespread use. In the mid-2010s, service platforms such as Yandex.Taxi, Uber and Gett displaced many private drivers and small service providers and were in 2015 servicing more than 50% of all taxi orders in Moscow.[206][207]\n\n\nRussian tech firm Yandex is testing self-driving taxis in Moscow. Yandex's fleet of around 170 driverless cars has travelled more than 14 million kilometres. Robotaxis will available through the company's Yandex.Go application in Yasenevo district.[208]\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Komsomolskaya Square known as \"Three Station Square\" thanks to three ornate rail terminal situated there: Leningradsky, Yaroslavsky, and Kazansky. Several train stations serve the city. Moscow's ten rail terminals (or *vokzals*) are:\n\n\n* Belorussky Rail Terminal\n* Kazansky Rail Terminal\n* Kiyevsky Rail Terminal\n* Kursky Rail Terminal\n* Leningradsky Rail Terminal\n* Paveletsky Rail Terminal\n* Rizhsky Rail Terminal\n* Savyolovsky Rail Terminal\n* Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal\n* Vostochny railway Terminal\n\n\n![](image)The high-speed Sapsan train links Moscow with Saint Petersburg.\nThe terminals are located close to the city center, along with the metro ringline 5 or close to it, and connect to a metro line to the centre of town. Each station handles trains from different parts of Europe and Asia.[209] There are many smaller railway stations in Moscow. As train tickets are cheap, they are the preferred mode of travel for Russians, especially when departing to Saint Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city. Moscow is the western terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, which traverses nearly 9,300 kilometres (5,800 mi) of Russian territory to Vladivostok on the Pacific coast.\n\n\nSuburbs and satellite cities are connected by commuter elektrichka (electric rail) network. Elektrichkas depart from each of these terminals to the nearby (up to 140 km or 87 mi) large railway stations.\n\n\nDuring the 2010s, the Little Ring of the Moscow Railway was converted to be used for frequent passenger service; it is fully integrated with Moscow Metro; the passenger service started on September 10, 2016. A connecting railway line on the North side of the town connects Belorussky terminal with other railway lines. This is used by some suburban trains.\n\n\n\n#### Moscow Central Circle[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Lastochka\" train on \"Luzhniki\" station (Line 14)\nThe Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga formed a ring around the now-downtown Moscow since 1903, but only served as a non-electrified, fueled locomotive-only railway prior to reconstruction into MCC in 2010's.\n\n\nThe Moscow Central Circle is a 54-kilometre-long (34 mi) urban-metro railway orbital line that encircles historical Moscow. It was built alongside Little Ring of the Moscow Railway, taking some of its tracks into itself as well. M.C.C. was opened for passenger use on September 10, 2016. MOZD is integrated as \"Line 14 of Moscow Metro\", and, while using railway-sized trains, can be perceived as \"S-train-design circle line\".\n\n\nThe line is operated by the Moscow Government owned company MKZD through the Moscow Metro, with the Federal Government owned Russian Railways selected as the operation subcontractor. The track infrastructure and most platforms are owned by Russian Railways, while MKZD owns most station buildings. However, in *S-bahn* way, Moscow unified tickets \"Ediniiy\" and \"Troika\" are accepted by MCC stations. There is one zero-fee interchange for any ticket used on Moscow Metro station less than 90 minutes before entering an MCC station (and vice versa: a passenger of MCC gets 1 free interchange to Moscow Metro within 90 minutes after entering MCC station)\n\n\n\n#### Moscow Central Diameters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An EG2Tv train arriving at the Moscow Belorussky railway station\n![](image)Map of the Moscow Central Diameters\nAnother system, which forms \"genuine *S-Bahn*\" as in \"suburbia-city-suburbia\"-designed railway, is the Moscow Central Diameters, a pass-through railways system, created by constructing bypasses from \"vokzals\" final stations (e.g. by avoiding the central stations of already existing Moscow Railway, used for both intercity and urban-suburban travel before)[210] and forming a train line across Moscow's centre.\n\n\nOut of 5 projected lines, the first 2 lines were completed and launched on 2019-11-21 (e.g. November 21, 2019).\n\n\nWhile using the same rails as \"regular\" suburban trains to vokzals, MCD trains (\"*Ivolga*\" model) got distinguishing features (shape; red cabin, different windows, lesser amount of seats; big red \"MЦΔ\" train logo).\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Intersection at Tverskaya Zastava Square\nThere are over 2.6 million cars in the city daily. Recent years have seen growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and lack of parking space to become major problems.\n\n\nThe Moscow Ring Road (MKAD), along with the Third Transport Ring and the canceled Fourth Transport Ring, is one of only three freeways that run within Moscow city limits. Several other roadway systems form concentric circles around the city.\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nThere are five primary commercial airports serving Moscow: Sheremetyevo (SVO), Domodedovo (DME), Vnukovo (VKO), Zhukovsky (ZIA), Ostafyevo (OSF).\n\n\n\n![](image)Sheremetyevo, the busiest airport in Russia, is ranked as the second-busiest airport in Europe.\nSheremetyevo International Airport is the most globally connected of Moscow's airports, handling 60% of all international flights.[211] It is also a home to all SkyTeam members, and the main hub for Aeroflot (itself a member of SkyTeam). Domodedovo International Airport is the leading airport in Russia in terms of passenger throughput and is the primary gateway to long-haul domestic and CIS destinations and its international traffic rivals Sheremetyevo. It is a hub for S7 airlines, and most of OneWorld and Star Alliance members use Domodedovo as their international hub. Vnukovo International Airport handles flights of Turkish Airlines, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi and others. Ostafyevo International Airport caters primarily to business aviation.\n\n\nMoscow's airports vary in distances from the MKAD beltway: Domodedovo is the farthest at 22 km (14 mi); Vnukovo is 11 km (7 mi); Sheremetyevo is 10 km (6 mi); and Ostafievo, the nearest, is about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from MKAD.[211]\n\n\nThere are a number of smaller airports close to Moscow (19 in Moscow Oblast) such as Myachkovo Airport, that are intended for private aircraft, helicopters and charters.[212]\n\n\n\n### Water[edit]\n\n\nMoscow has two passenger terminals, (South River Terminal and North River Terminal or Rechnoy vokzal), on the river and regular ship routes and cruises along the Moskva and Oka rivers, which are used mostly for entertainment. The North River Terminal, built in 1937, is the main hub for long-range river routes. There are three freight ports serving Moscow.\n\n\n\n### Sharing system[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carsharing in Moscow\n\n![](image)As of 2020[update], Moscow has the largest fleet of carsharing vehicles in the world, with more than 30,000 cars.[213]\nMoscow has different vehicle sharing options that are sponsored by the local government. There are several car sharing companies which are in charge of providing cars to the population. To drive the automobiles, the user has to book them through the app of the owning company. In 2018 the mayor Sergey Sobyanin said Moscow's car sharing system has become the biggest in Europe in terms of vehicle fleet.[214] Every day about 25,000 people use this service. In the end of the same year Moscow carsharing became the second in the world in therms of fleet with 16.5K available vehicles.[215] Another sharing system is bike sharing (*Velobike*) of a fleet formed by 3000 traditional and electrical bicycles.[216] The *Delisamokat* is a new sharing service that provides electrical scooters.[217] There are companies that provide different vehicles to the population in proximity to Moscow's big parks.\n\n\n\n### Future development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2020 development concept of Moscow International Business Center and its adjacent territory implies the construction of even more skyscrapers during the period of 2020–2027.[218][219]\nIn 1992, the Moscow government began planning a projected new part of central Moscow, the Moscow International Business Center, with the goal of creating a zone, the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe,[220] that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment. Situated in Presnensky District and located at the Third Ring, the Moscow City area is under intense development. The construction of the MIBC takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. The whole project takes up to one square kilometre (250 acres). The area is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude. Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.\n\n\nThe Federation Tower, completed in 2016, is the second-tallest building in Europe. It is planned to include a water park and other recreational facilities; business, office, entertainment, and residential buildings, a transport network and a new site for the Moscow government. The construction of four new metro stations in the territory has been completed, two of which have opened and two others are reserved for future metro lines crossing MIBC, some additional stations were planned. \n\n\n\n* A rail shuttle service, directly connecting MIBC with the Sheremetyevo International Airport is also planned.\n\n\nMajor thoroughfares through MIBC are the Third Ring and Kutuzovsky Prospekt.\n\n\nThree metro stations were initially planned for the Filyovskaya Line. The station Delovoi Tsentr opened in 2005 and was later renamed Vystavochnaya in 2009. The branch extended to the Mezhdunarodnaya station in 2006, and all work on the third station, Dorogomilovskaya (between Kiyevskaya and Delovoi Tsentr), has been postponed.

It is located in the southern portion of the province of Ontario, at the confluence of the Ottawa River and the Rideau River. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec, and forms the core of the Ottawa–Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR).[15] As of 2021,[update] Ottawa had a city population of 1,017,449 and a metropolitan population of 1,488,307, making it the fourth-largest city and fourth-largest metropolitan area in Canada.\n\n\nOttawa is the political centre of Canada and headquarters to the federal government. The city houses numerous foreign embassies, key buildings, organizations, and institutions of Canada's government; these include the Parliament of Canada, the Supreme Court, the residence of Canada's viceroy, and Office of the Prime Minister.[16]\n\n\nFounded in 1826 as Bytown, and incorporated as Ottawa in 1855,[17] its original boundaries were expanded through numerous annexations and were ultimately replaced by a new city incorporation and amalgamation in 2001. The municipal government of Ottawa is established and governed by the City of Ottawa Act of the Government of Ontario, and has an elected city council across 24 wards and a mayor elected city-wide.\n\n\nOttawa has the highest proportion of university educated residents among Canadian cities[18] and is home to a number of colleges and universities, research and cultural institutions, including the University of Ottawa, Carleton University, Algonquin College, the National Arts Centre, the National Gallery of Canada; and numerous national museums, monuments, and historic sites.[19] It is one of the most visited cities in Canada, with over 11 million visitors annually contributing more than $2.2B to the city's economy.[20][21]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe city name *Ottawa* was chosen in 1855 as a reference to the Ottawa River, the name of which is derived from the Algonquin *adawe*, meaning 'to trade'.[22][23] The city's modern name in Algonquin language is *Odàwàg*.[24] The Algonquin Anishinaabe previously occupied a large tract of land on which Ottawa was settled.[25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ottawa\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Ottawa history.\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Champlain Sea\nOttawa is situated on the traditional land of the Algonquins, a broad Indigenous people who are closely related to the Odawa and Ojibwe peoples.[26][27]\n\n\nThe Ottawa Valley became habitable around 10,000 years ago, following the natural draining of the Champlain Sea.[28][29] Archaeological findings of arrowheads, tools and pottery indicate that Indigenous populations first settled in the area about 6,500 years ago.[30][31] These findings suggest that these Algonquin people were engaged in foraging, hunting and fishing, but also trade and travel. Three major rivers meet within Ottawa, making it an important trade and travel area for thousands of years.[30] This period ended with the arrival of settlers and colonization of North America by Europeans during and after the 15th century.[32]\n\n\n\n### European exploration and early development[edit]\n\n\nIn 1610, Étienne Brûlé, became the first documented European to navigate the Ottawa River, passing what would become Ottawa on his way to the Great Lakes.[33] Three years later, Samuel de Champlain wrote about the waterfalls in the area and about his encounters with the Algonquin people.[34]\n\n\nThe first non-Indigenous settlement in the area was created by Philemon Wright, a New Englander. Wright founded a lumber town in the area on 7 March 1800 on the north side of the river, across from the present-day city of Ottawa in Hull.[35][36] He, with five other families and twenty-five labourers, also created an agricultural community, which was named Wrightsville.[37][38] Wright pioneered the Ottawa Valley timber trade (soon to be the area's most significant economic activity) by transporting timber by river from the Ottawa Valley to Quebec City.[39]\n\n\nIn 1826, news of the impending construction of the Rideau Canal by the British military led to land speculators founding a community on the south side of the Ottawa River.[40] The following year, the town was named after British military engineer Colonel John By who was responsible for the entire Rideau Waterway construction project.[41] The Rideau canal provided a secure route between Montreal and Kingston on Lake Ontario. It bypassed a vulnerable stretch of the St. Lawrence River bordering the state of New York that had left re-supply ships bound for southwestern Ontario easily exposed to enemy fire during the War of 1812.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Camp used by soldiers and labourers of the Rideau Canal, on the south side of the Ottawa River in 1826. The building of the canal attracted many land speculators to the area.\nColonel By set up military barracks on the site of today's Parliament Hill. He also laid out the streets of the town and created two distinct neighbourhoods named \"Upper Town\" west of the canal and \"Lower Town\" east of the canal. Similar to its Upper Canada and Lower Canada namesakes, historically \"Upper Town\" was predominantly English-speaking and Protestant whereas \"Lower Town\" was predominantly French, Irish and Catholic.[43][*page needed*]\n\n\nBytown's population grew to 1,000 as the Rideau Canal was being completed in 1832.[44][45] Bytown' early pioneer period saw Irish labour unrest during the Shiners' War from 1835 to 1845[46] and political dissension that was evident in the 1849 Stony Monday Riot.[47] In 1855, Bytown was renamed *Ottawa* and incorporated as a city.[23] William Pittman Lett was installed as the first city clerk, serving from 1844 to 1891, guiding Ottawa through 36 years of development, leading the hiring of key municipal roles, founding civic organizations, and proposing a set of by-laws for the city.[48][49][50]\n\n\n\n### Selection as capital[edit]\n\n\nSelection of Ottawa as the capital of Canada predates the Confederation of Canada. The selection was contentious and not straightforward, with the parliament of the United Province of Canada holding more than 200 votes over several decades to attempt to settle on a legislative solution to the location of the capital.[51]\n\n\nThe governor general of the province had designated Kingston as the capital in 1841. However, the major population centres of Toronto and Montreal, as well as the former capital of Lower Canada, Quebec City, all had legislators dissatisfied with Kingston. Anglophone merchants in Quebec were the main group supportive of the Kingston arrangement.[52] In 1842, a vote rejected Kingston as the capital, and study of potential candidates included the then-named Bytown, but that option proved less popular than Toronto or Montreal.[53] In 1843, a report of the Executive Council recommended Montreal as the capital as a more fortifiable location and commercial centre; however, the governor general refused to execute a move without a parliamentary vote.[54] In 1844, the Queen's acceptance of a parliamentary vote moved the capital to Montreal.[55]\n\n\nIn 1849, after violence in Montreal, a series of votes was held, with Kingston and Bytown both again considered as capitals. However, the successful proposal was for two cities to share capital status, and the legislature to alternate sitting in each: Quebec City and Toronto, in a policy known as perambulation.[56][57] Logistical difficulties made this an unpopular arrangement,[58] and although an 1856 vote passed for the lower house of parliament to relocate permanently to Quebec City, the upper house refused to approve funding.[59]\n\n\nThe funding impasse led to the ending of the legislature's role in determining the seat of government. The legislature requested the Queen make the determination of the seat of government. The Queen then acted on the advice of her governor general Edmund Head,[60] who, after reviewing proposals from various cities, selected the recently renamed Ottawa. The Queen sent a letter to colonial authorities selecting Ottawa as the capital, effective 31 December 1857. George Brown, briefly a co-premier of the Province of Canada, attempted to reverse this decision, but was unsuccessful. The Queen's choice was ratified by the Parliament in 1859, with Quebec serving as interim capital from 1859 to 1865.[51][61] The relocation process began in 1865, with the first session of Parliament held in the new buildings in 1866, and the buildings were generally well received by legislators.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ottawa in 1859, before construction on Parliament Hill. Two years prior, Queen Victoria selected the city as the permanent capital of the Province of Canada.\nOttawa was chosen as the capital for two primary reasons.[63] First, Ottawa's isolated location, surrounded by dense forest far from the Canada–US border and situated on a cliff face, would make it more defensible from attack.[64][65] Second, Ottawa was approximately midway between Toronto and Kingston (in Canada West) and Montreal and Quebec City (in Canada East) making the selection an important political compromise.[66][67]\n\n\nOther minor considerations included that despite Ottawa's regional isolation, there was water transportation access from spring to fall, both to Montreal via the Ottawa River, and to Kingston via the Rideau Waterway.[68] Additionally, by 1854 it also had a modern all-season railway (the Bytown and Prescott Railway) that carried passengers, lumber and supplies the 82 kilometres (50 miles) to Prescott on the Saint Lawrence River and beyond.[37][64] Ottawa's small size was also thought to be less prone to politically motivated mob violence, as had happened in the previous Canadian capitals.[69] Finally, the government already owned the land that eventually became Parliament Hill, which it thought would be an ideal location for the Parliament Buildings.[66]\n\n\nThe original Parliament buildings, which included the Centre, East and West Blocks, were constructed between 1859 and 1866 in the Gothic Revival style.[70] At the time, this was the largest North American construction project ever attempted and Public Works Canada and its architects were not initially well prepared for the relatively shallow-lying bedrock, and had to redesign architectural drawings, leading to delays. The Library of Parliament and Parliament Hill landscaping were completed in 1876.[71]\n\n\n\n### Post-Confederation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)LeBreton Flats after the 1900 Hull–Ottawa fire. The fire destroyed one-fifth of Ottawa and two-thirds of neighbouring Hull, Quebec.\nStarting in the 1850s, entrepreneurs known as lumber barons began to build large sawmills, which became some of the largest mills in the world.[72] Rail lines built in 1854 connected Ottawa to areas south and, from 1886, to the transcontinental rail network via Hull and Lachute, Quebec.[73] By 1885 Ottawa was the only city in Canada whose downtown street-lights were powered entirely by electricity.[74] In 1889, the Government developed and distributed 60 \"water leases\" (still in use) to mainly local industrialists which gave them permission to generate electricity and operate hydroelectric generators at Chaudière Falls.[75] Public transportation began in 1870 with a horsecar system,[76] overtaken in the 1890s by a vast electric streetcar system that operated until 1959.[77]\n\n\nThe Hull–Ottawa fire of 1900 destroyed two-thirds of Hull, including 40 percent of its residential buildings and most of the buildings of its largest employers along the waterfront.[78] It began as a chimney fire in Hull on the north side of the river, but due to wind, spread rapidly throughout the widespread wooden buildings. In Ottawa, it destroyed about one-fifth of the buildings from the Lebreton Flats south to Booth Street and down to Dow's Lake.[79][80] The fire had a disproportionate effect on west end lower-income neighbourhoods. It had also spread among many lumber yards, a major part of Ottawa's economy. The fire destroyed approximately 3200 buildings and caused an estimated $300 million in damage (in 2020 Canadian dollars).[81] An estimated 14% of Ottawans were left homeless.[82]\n\n\n\n![A sepia photograph from the fourth floor of a building, overlooking a triangular public plaza, many old cars with canvas tops are parked in the square. Neo-gothic buildings make up 2 borders of the square, and a set of tram tracks comprise the third](image)Ottawa Post Office, located in Confederation Square, pictured in the early 20th century\nOn 1 June 1912, the Grand Trunk Railway opened both the Château Laurier hotel and its neighbouring downtown Union Station.[83][84] On 3 February 1916, the Centre Block of the Parliament buildings was destroyed by a fire.[85] The House of Commons and Senate was temporarily relocated to the recently constructed Victoria Memorial Museum, now the Canadian Museum of Nature[86] until the completion of the new Centre Block in 1922. The centrepiece of the new Parliament Buildings is a dominant Gothic Revival-styled structure known as the Peace Tower.[87]\n\n\nThe location of what is now Confederation Square was a former commercial district centrally located in a triangular area downtown surrounded by historically significant heritage buildings which include the Parliament buildings. It was redeveloped as a ceremonial centre in 1938 as part of the City Beautiful Movement and became the site of the National War Memorial in 1939 and designated a National Historic Site in 1984.[88] A new Central Post Office (now the Privy Council of Canada) was constructed in 1939 beside the War Memorial because the original post office building on the proposed Confederation Square grounds had to be demolished.[89]\n\n\n\n### Post-Second World War[edit]\n\n\n![](image)V-Day, downtown Ottawa in 1945, to mark the end of World War II\n![](image)Greber plan's National Capital Greenbelt surrounding the urban core\n![](image)The John G. Diefenbaker Building was Ottawa's fourth city hall, from 1958 until 2001.\nOttawa's former industrial appearance was vastly altered by the 1950 Greber Plan.[90] Prime Minister Mackenzie King hired French architect-planner Jacques Greber to design an urban plan for managing development in the National Capital Region, to make it more aesthetically pleasing and a location more befitting for Canada's political centre.[91][92] Greber's plan included the creation of the National Capital Greenbelt, the Kichi Zibi Mikan and the Queensway highway system. His plan also called for changes in institutions such as moving downtown Union Station (now the Senate of Canada Building) to the suburbs, the removal of the street car system, the decentralization of selected government offices, the relocation of industries and removal of substandard housing from the downtown. The plan also recommended the creation of the Rideau Canal and Ottawa River pathways.[91][93][94]\n\n\nIn 1958, the National Capital Commission was established as a Crown Corporation through the National Capital Act. The commission's original mission was to implement the Greber Plan recommendations—which it conducted during the 1960s and 1970s.[95] This marked the creation of a permanent political infrastructure for managing the capital region. Prior attempts to do so in the previous 50 years had been temporary in nature. These included plans from the 1899 Ottawa Improvement Commission (OIC), the Todd Plan in 1903, the Holt Report in 1915 and the Federal District Commission (FDC) which was established in 1927 with a 16-year mandate.[96][97]\n\n\nFrom 1931 to 1958, City Hall had been at the Transportation Building adjacent to Union Station (now part of the Rideau Centre). In 1958 a new City Hall opened on Green Island near Rideau Falls where urban renewal had recently transformed this industrial location into green space.[98] In 2001, Ottawa City Hall returned downtown to a 1990 building on 110 Laurier Avenue West, the home of the now-defunct Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. This new location was close to Ottawa's first (1849–1877) and second (1877–1931) City Halls.[99] This new city hall complex also contained an adjacent 19th-century restored heritage building formerly known as the Ottawa Normal School.[98]\n\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, there was a large increase in construction in the National Capital Region,[100] which was followed by large growth in the high-tech industry during the 1990s and 2000s.[101] Ottawa became one of Canada's largest high-tech cities and was nicknamed Silicon Valley North. By the 1980s, Bell Northern Research (later Nortel) employed thousands, and large federally assisted research facilities such as the National Research Council contributed to an eventual technology boom. The early companies led to newer firms such as Newbridge Networks, Mitel and Corel.[102][103]\n\n\nIn 1991, provincial and federal governments responded to a land claim submitted by the Algonquins of Ontario, regarding the unceded status of the land on which Ottawa is situated.[104] Negotiations have been ongoing, with an eventual goal to sign a treaty that would release Canada from claims for misuse of land under Algonquin title, affirm rights of the Algonquins, and negotiate conditions of the title transfer.[105]\n\n\nOttawa's city limits have expanded over time, including a large expansion effective 1 January 2001, when the Province of Ontario amalgamated all the constituent municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton into a single city.[106] Regional Chair Bob Chiarelli was elected as the new city's first mayor in the 2000 municipal election, defeating Gloucester mayor Claudette Cain.[107] The city's growth led to strains on the public transit system and road bridges. On 15 October 2001, a diesel-powered light rail transit (LRT) line was introduced on an experimental basis. Known today as the Trillium Line, it was dubbed the O-Train and connected downtown Ottawa to the southern suburbs via Carleton University. The decision to extend the O-Train, and to replace it with an electric light rail system, was a major issue in the 2006 municipal elections, where Chiarelli was defeated by businessman Larry O'Brien.[108] After O'Brien's election, transit plans were changed to establish a series of light rail stations from the east side of the city into downtown, and for using a tunnel through the downtown core.[109] Jim Watson, the last mayor of Ottawa prior to amalgamation, was re-elected in the 2010 election.[110]\n\n\nIn October 2012, the City Council approved the final Lansdowne Park plan, an agreement with the Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group that saw a new stadium, increased green space, and housing and retail added to the site.[111][112] In December 2012, City Council voted unanimously to move forward with the Confederation Line, a 12.5 km (7.8 mi) light rail transit line, which was opened on 14 September 2019.[113]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Ottawa\n\n### Neighbourhoods[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of neighbourhoods in Ottawa\n\nThe present day city of Ottawa consist of the historic main urban area, as well as other urban, suburban and rural areas within the city's post-amalgamation limits.[114]\n\n\n\n#### Old Ottawa[edit]\n\n\nOld Ottawa refers to the former pre-amalgamation city, as well as the former city of Vanier, a densely populated, historically francophone, working class enclave, and the former village of Rockcliffe Park, a wealthy residential neighbourhood adjacent to the Prime Minister's official residence at 24 Sussex and the Governor General's residence.[115][116] The old city includes the downtown core and older neighbourhoods to the east, west, and south. These vibrant neighbourhoods include the bustling commercial and cultural areas of Old Ottawa South,\nCentretown, Lower Town, and Sandy Hill, the affluent tree lined neighbourhoods of The Glebe, Westboro, and New Edinburgh, and the historically blue-collar communities of Hintonburg, Mechanicsville, Carlington, and LeBreton Flats, with a mixture of housing types, artist lofts, and industrial uses. The old city also includes the ethnic enclaves of Chinatown and Little Italy.\n\n\n\n#### Suburbs and outlying communities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Ottawa showing urban areas and names of historical communities\nModern Ottawa is made up of eleven historic townships, ten of which are from the former Carleton County and one from the former Russell County.[117] Ottawa city limits are bounded on the east by the United Counties of Prescott and Russell; by Renfrew County and Lanark County in the west; on the south by the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville and the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry; and on the north by the Regional County Municipality of Les Collines-de-l'Outaouais and the City of Gatineau.[118][119]\n\n\nThe main suburban areas extend a considerable distance to the east, west and south of the inner-city.[120][121] These areas also include the former cities of Cumberland, Gloucester, Kanata and Nepean.[122] The towns of Stittsville and Richmond within the former Goulbourn Township are to the southwest.[115][123] Nepean as a suburb also includes Barrhaven.[115][124] The communities of Manotick and Riverside South are on the other side of the Rideau River, and Greely, southeast of Riverside South.[115]\n\n\nA number of rural communities (villages and hamlets) are administratively part of the Ottawa municipality.[120] Some of these communities are Burritts Rapids; Ashton; Fallowfield; Kars; Fitzroy Harbour; Munster; Carp; North Gower; Metcalfe; Constance Bay and Osgoode.[115] Several towns are within the federally defined National Capital Region but outside the city of Ottawa municipal boundaries;[120] these include communities of Almonte, Carleton Place, Embrun, Kemptville, Rockland, and Russell.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nOttawa above the Ottawa River in 2017, left to right— Byward Market **·** Fairmont Château Laurier **·** National Gallery of Canada **·** Rideau Canal Locks **·** Parliament Hill with Library of Parliament and Peace Tower **·** Alexandra Bridge **·** Downtown Ottawa towers **·** Supreme Court of Canada\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Ottawa\n\n![](image)Completed in 1913, the Connaught Building was constructed in a Gothic Revival style.\nInfluenced by government structures, much of the city's architecture tends to be formal and functional; the city is also marked by Romantic and Picturesque styles of architecture such as the Parliament Buildings' gothic revival architecture.[125] Ottawa's domestic architecture contains single-family homes, but also includes smaller numbers of semi-detached houses, rowhouses, and apartment buildings.[126] Many domestic buildings in Centretown are clad in red brick, with trim in wood, stone, or metal; variations are common, depending on the cultural heritage of the neighbourhoods and the time they were built.[127]\n\n\nThe skyline has been controlled by building height restrictions originally implemented to keep Parliament Hill and the Peace Tower at 92.2 m (302 ft) visible from most parts of the city.[128] Today, several buildings are slightly taller than the Peace Tower, with the tallest being the Claridge Icon at 143 metres (469 ft).[129] Many federal buildings in the National Capital Region are managed by Public Works Canada, which leads to heritage conservation in its renovations and management of buildings, such as the renovation of the Senate Building.[130][131] Most of the federal land in the region is managed by the National Capital Commission; its control of much undeveloped land and appropriations powers gives the NCC a great deal of influence over the city's development.[132][133][134]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nOttawa has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: *Dfb*)[135] with four distinct seasons and is between Zones 5a and 5b on the Canadian Plant Hardiness Scale.[136] The average July maximum temperature is 26.6 °C (80 °F). The average January minimum temperature is −14.4 °C (6.1 °F).[137] The highest temperature ever recorded in Ottawa was 37.8 °C (100 °F) on 4 July 1913, 1 August 1917 and 11 August 1944.[138][139]\n\n\nSummers are warm and humid in Ottawa. On average there are 11 days across the three summer months of June, July and August that have temperatures exceeding 30 °C (86 °F).[140]\n\n\nSnow and ice are dominant during the winter season. On average, almost every day of January, February and March, have more than 5 cm of snowpack (29, 28, and 22 days, respectively), and on average, approximately 12 days a year see 5 cm or more of snowfall, with 4 of those having over 10 cm.[140]\n\n\nAn average 17 days of the year experience temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F).[140] Spring and fall are variable, prone to extremes in temperature and unpredictable swings in conditions. The month of May, for example, sees a day below freezing about every other year, but sees days above 30 °C at about the same rate.[140]\n\n\nAnnual precipitation averages around 750mm per year.[140] Precipitation is spread throughout the year, with some variation. May through November are the months more likely to see precipitation and major precipitation events, with each month having an average of 3 days of over 1 cm of precipitation, with December through April seeing on average 1–2 days. May through November have on average over 8 cm of precipitation per month, with peaks of approximately 9 cm in June and September. December through April have less than 8 cm, with February being the driest month at an average of 5 cm of precipitation.[140]\n\n\n\nOttawa experiences about 2,080 hours of average sunshine annually (45% of possible).[140] Winds in Ottawa tend to come from the West, though eastward winds caused by lake-effect cells in afternoons are not unusual.[141] Winds tend to be slightly more dominant during the winter.[138][141]\n\n| Climate data for Ottawa (Central Experimental Farm), 1981–2010 normals, extremes 1872–present[a] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n |

|\n\n### Physical geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Downtown Ottawa is situated on the south bank of the Ottawa River with neighbouring Gatineau in the background across the river.\nOttawa is situated on the south bank of the Ottawa River and contains the mouths of the Rideau River and Rideau Canal.[153] The Rideau Canal (Rideau Waterway) first opened in 1832 and is 202 km (126 mi) long.[154] It connects the Saint Lawrence River on Lake Ontario at Kingston to the Ottawa River near Parliament Hill. It was able to bypass the unnavigable sections of the Cataraqui and Rideau rivers and various small lakes along the waterway due to flooding techniques and the construction of 47 water transport locks.\n\n\nOttawa is situated in a lowland on top of Paleozoic carbonate and shale, and is surrounded by more craggy Precambrian igneous and metamorphic formations. Ottawa has had fluvial deposition of till and sands, leading to the widespread formation of eskers. There are limited distinct features arising from glacial deposits, but Ottawa was affected by the Late Wisconsian advance. Prior to the draining of the Champlain Sea, the area had high salinity. After the draining of the sea, the area had pine-dominated forests.[155] Ottawa is located within the Western Quebec Seismic Zone, and while relatively inactive, the city does occasionally experience earthquakes.[156][157][158][159][160]\n\n\n\n### Built environment[edit]\n\n\nDuring part of the winter season the Ottawa section of the canal forms the world's largest skating rink, thereby providing both a recreational venue and a 7.8 km (4.8 mi) transportation path to downtown for ice skaters (from Carleton University and Dow's Lake to the Rideau Centre and National Arts Centre).[161] On 29 June 2007, the Rideau Canal was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[162]\n\n\nThe older part of the city (including what remains of Bytown) is known as Lower Town,[163] and occupies an area between the canal and the rivers. Across the canal to the west lie both Centretown and Downtown Ottawa, which share a border along Gloucester street.[164] These core neighbourhoods contain streets such as Elgin and Bank, which fill the role of commercial main streets in the region.[165]\n\n\nCentretown is next to downtown, which includes a substantial economic and architectural government presence across multiple branches of government. The legislature's work takes place in the parliamentary precinct, which includes buildings on Parliament Hill and others downtown, such as the Senate of Canada Building.[166] Important buildings in the executive branch include the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council as well as many civil service buildings.[167][168] The Supreme Court of Canada building can also be found in this area.[169]\n\n\nAcross the Ottawa River, which forms the border between Ontario and Quebec, lies the city of Gatineau, itself the result of amalgamation of the former Quebec cities of Hull and Aylmer.[170] Although formally and administratively separate cities in two separate provinces, Ottawa and Gatineau (along with a number of nearby municipalities) collectively constitute the National Capital Region, which is considered a single metropolitan area.[171] One federal Crown corporation, the National Capital Commission, or NCC, has significant land holdings in both cities, including sites of historical and touristic importance.[171] The NCC, through its responsibility for planning and development of these lands, has a key role in shaping the development of the city.[172] Around the main urban area is an extensive greenbelt, administered by the NCC for conservation and leisure, and comprising mostly forest, farmland and marshland.[173]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Ottawa\n\n![](image)Ottawa population pyramid in 2021\n\n\nHistoric Population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1901 | 101,102 | —     |\n| 1911 | 123,417 | +22.1% |\n| 1921 | 152,868 | +23.9% |\n| 1931 | 174,056 | +13.9% |\n| 1941 | 206,367 | +18.6% |\n| 1951 | 246,298 | +19.3% |\n| 1956 | 287,244 | +16.6% |\n| 1961 | 358,410 | +24.8% |\n| 1966 | 413,695 | +15.4% |\n| 1971 | 471,931 | +14.1% |\n| 1976 | 520,533 | +10.3% |\n| 1981 | 546,849 | +5.1% |\n| 1986 | 606,639 | +10.9% |\n| 1991 | 678,147 | +11.8% |\n| 1996 | 721,136 | +6.3% |\n| 2001 | 774,072 | +7.3% |\n| 2006 | 812,129 | +4.9% |\n| 2011 | 883,391 | +8.8% |\n| 2016 | 934,243 | +5.8% |\n| 2021 | 1,017,449 | +8.9% |\n| Note: Population figures are extrapolated for current municipal boundaries Sources:[174][175][176][177][178][b][180][8]Chart format |\n\n\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Ottawa had a population of 1,017,449 living in 407,252 of its 427,113 total private dwellings, a change of 8.9% from its 2016 population of 934,243. With a land area of 2,788.2 km2 (1,076.5 sq mi), it had a population density of 364.9/km2 (945.1/sq mi) in 2021.[181]\n\n\nAs of 2021 the Ottawa - Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) had a population of 1,488,307 living in 604,721 of its 638,013 total private dwellings, a change of 8.5% from its 2016 population of 1,371,576. With a land area of 8,046.99 km2 (3,106.96 sq mi), it had a population density of 185.0/km2 (479.0/sq mi) in 2021.[182]\n\n\nOttawa's median age of 40.1 is both below the provincial and national averages as of 2016. Youths under 15 years constituted 16.7% of the total population in 2016, while those of retirement age (65 years and older) made up 15.4%.[183]\n\n\nThe 2021 census reported that immigrants (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 259,215 persons or 25.9% of the total population of Ottawa. Of the total immigrant population, the top countries of origin were China (20,320 persons or 7.8%), India (16,200 persons or 6.2%), United Kingdom (14,760 persons or 5.7%), Lebanon (11,900 persons or 4.6%), Philippines (10,505 persons or 4.1%), United States of America (8,795 persons or 3.4%), Haiti (6,710 persons or 2.6%), Syria (6,370 persons or 2.5%), Vietnam (6,155 persons or 2.4%), and Iran (6,000 persons or 2.3%).[184]\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2016, approximately 69.1% of Ottawa's population was European, while 4.6% were aboriginal and 26.3% were visible minorities (higher than the national percentage of 22.3%).[185]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, religious groups in Ottawa included:[184]\n\n\n\n* Christianity (528,700 persons or 52.8%)\n* Irreligion (316,740 persons or 31.6%)\n* Islam (98,920 persons or 9.9%)\n* Hinduism (20,300 persons or 2.0%)\n* Buddhism (10,800 persons or 1.1%)\n* Judaism (10,600 persons or 1.1%)\n* Sikhism (6,375 persons or 0.6%)\n* Indigenous Spirituality (445 persons or <0.1%)\n* Other (8,055 persons or 0.8%)\n\n\nIn 2011[update], around 65% of Ottawa residents described themselves as Christian, with Catholics accounting for 38.5% of the population and members of Protestant churches 25%. Other religions are were also present in Ottawa, the largest being Islam (6.7%), Hinduism (1.4%), Buddhism (1.3%), and Judaism (1.2%). Those with no religious affiliation represent ed22.8%.[186]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nBilingualism became official policy for the conduct of municipal business in 2002,[187] and 37.6% of the population can speak both languages as of 2016, making it the largest city in Canada with both English and French as co-official languages.[188] Those who identify their mother tongue as English constitute 62.4 percent, while those with French as their mother tongue make up 14.2 percent of the population. In terms of respondents' knowledge of one or both official languages, 59.9 percent and 1.5 percent of the population have knowledge of English only and French only, respectively; while 37.2 percent have a knowledge of both official languages. The overall Ottawa–Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) has a larger proportion of French speakers than Ottawa itself, since Gatineau's population's first language is mostly French. However, Gatineau is also the most bilingual city in Canada, making the region one of the most bilingual. An additional 20.4 percent of the population list languages other than English and French as their mother tongue. These include Arabic (3.2%), Chinese (3.0%), Spanish (1.2%), Italian (1.1%), and many others.[186]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Ontario\n\n![](image)Federal government buildings in Tunney's Pasture\nAs of 2015, the region of Ottawa-Gatineau has the sixth-highest total household income of all Canadian metropolitan areas ($82,053), and the Ontario portion more directly overlapping the City of Ottawa has a higher household income ($86,451).[189] The median household income after taxes in the City of Ottawa is $73,745 in 2016 was higher than the national median of $61,348.[190] Ottawa's unemployment rate has remained below the national and provincial unemployment rates since 2006, with a rate of 5.2% in April 2022, low compared to the decade preceding.[191][192] In 2019 Mercer ranks Ottawa with the third highest quality of living of any Canadian city, and 19th highest in the world.[193] It is also rated the second cleanest city in Canada, and third cleanest city in the world.[194]\n\n\nOttawa's primary employers are the Public Service of Canada and the high-tech industry, although tourism and healthcare also represent increasingly sizeable economic activities. The federal government is the city's largest employer, employing over 116,000 individuals from the National Capital Region.[195] The national headquarters for many federal departments are in Ottawa, particularly throughout Centretown and in the Terrasses de la Chaudière and Place du Portage complexes in Hull. The National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa is the main command centre for the Canadian Armed Forces and hosts the Department of National Defence.[196] During the summer, the city hosts the Ceremonial Guard, which performs functions such as the Changing the Guard.[197]\n\n\nAs the national capital of Canada, tourism is an important part of Ottawa's economy, particularly after the 150th anniversary of Canada which was centred in Ottawa. The lead-up to the festivities saw much investment in civic infrastructure, upgrades to tourist infrastructure and increases in national cultural attractions.[198] The National Capital Region annually attracts an estimated 22 million tourists, who spend about 2.2 billion dollars and support 30,600 jobs directly.[199][200]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kanata Research Park is Canada's largest technology park.\nIn addition to the economic activities that come with being the national capital, Ottawa is an important technology centre; in 2015, its 1800 companies employed approximately 63,400 people.[201] The concentration of companies in this industry earned the city the nickname of \"Silicon Valley North\".[101] Most of these companies specialize in telecommunications, software development and environmental technology. Large technology companies such as Nortel, Corel, Mitel, Cognos, Halogen Software, Shopify and JDS Uniphase were founded in the city.[202] Ottawa also has regional locations for Nokia, 3M, Adobe Systems, Bell Canada, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.[203] Many of the telecommunications and new technology are in the western part of the city (formerly Kanata). The \"tech sector\" was doing particularly well in 2015/2016.[204][205]\nNordion, i-Stat and the National Research Council of Canada and OHRI are part of the growing life science sector.[206][207]\n\n\nThe health sector is another major employer, which employs over 18,000 people in the city.[208] Business, finance, administration, and sales and service rank high among types of occupations.[180] Approximately ten percent of Ottawa's GDP is derived from finance, insurance and real estate whereas employment in goods-producing industries is only half the national average.[209] The City of Ottawa is the second largest employer[210][211] with approximately 2,100 people employed by the Ottawa Police service, and 13,300 full-time equivalent non-police employees.[212][213]\n\n\nIn 2016, Ottawa experienced an increase of 10,000 jobs over 2012 average growth that was relatively slower than in the late 1990s.[195][214] All major clusters tracked by the city saw increases in employment between 2014 and 2019.[215] Major areas of growth in the 2010s included local and federal administration, finance and accommodation.[195] Between 2008 and 2020, there was growth in the number of government employees and a reduction in high-tech jobs, a reversal of previous trends from 2003 to 2008.[214][215]\n\n\nOttawa already has the largest rural economy among Canada's major cities.[216] In Ottawa, the rural economy contributes over $1 billion to the GDP. Agriculture alone accounts for $400 million, $136.7 million of which is farm-gate sales.[217] Rural economic activity includes agriculture, retail sales, construction, forestry and mining (aggregates), tourism, manufacturing, personal and business services, and transportation, to name a few. Rural employment expanded by a healthy 18% from 1996 to 2001.[216]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Media in Ottawa–Gatineau\n\nThree main daily local newspapers are printed in Ottawa: two English newspapers, the *Ottawa Citizen* established as *the Bytown Packet* in 1845 and the *Ottawa Sun*, and one French newspaper, *Le Droit*.[218][219] The city is also home to local stations of the television broadcast networks and systems CBC and CTV, as well as English and French radio stations.[220][221][222]\n\n\nIn addition to the market's local media services, Ottawa is home to several national media operations, including CPAC (Canada's national legislature broadcaster)[223] and the parliamentary bureau staff of virtually all of Canada's major newsgathering organizations in television, radio and print.

Over time, Carleton transitioned into the highly ranked comprehensive university it is today.[235] The university's main campus sits between Old Ottawa South and Dow's Lake. Carleton's catholic affiliated university college, is the Dominican University College.[236]\n* The University of Ottawa (originally named the \"College of Bytown\") was the first post-secondary institution established in the city in 1848. The university later grew to become the largest English-French bilingual university in the world.[237] It is also a member of the U15, a group of highly respected research-intensive universities in Canada.[238] The university's main campus is in the Sandy Hill neighbourhood, just adjacent to the city's downtown core. The University of Ottawa's catholic affiliated university college is St. Paul University.\n* Algonquin College is a college of applied arts and technology, founded in 1967. Its main campus is located in the City View neighbourhood of College Ward. The college serves the National Capital Region and the outlying areas of Eastern Ontario, Western Quebec, and Upstate New York.[239] The college has satellite campuses in Pembroke and Perth, as well as four international campuses through their international offshore partnerships.\n* Collège La Cité is the largest French-language college in Ontario. Founded in 1989, its campus is located off the Aviation Parkway in the Carson Meadows neighbourhood. La Cité has satellite campus in Hawkesbury and a business office in Toronto.\n\n\nOther colleges and universities in the metropolitan area are located in the neighbouring suburb of Gatineau, including the University of Quebec in Outaouais, Cégep de l'Outaouais, and Heritage College.[240]\n\n\n\n## Public health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Civic Hospital is one of three main campuses of The Ottawa Hospital.\nSee also: List of hospitals in Ottawa\n\nThere are six active general medical hospitals in the city of Ottawa: The Queensway Carleton Hospital, The Ottawa Hospital (Civic Hospital, General Hospital, Riverside Hospital), Montfort Hospital, and Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.

The University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine operates teaching hospitals in conjunction with partners throughout the city.[242]\n\n\nOttawa is headquarters to numerous major medical organizations and institutions such as Canadian Red Cross, Canadian Blood Services, Health Canada, Canadian Medical Association, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, Canadian Nurses Association, and the Medical Council of Canada.\n\n\n\n## Culture and contemporary life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ByWard Market is a retail and entertainment district in Downtown Ottawa.\nTraditionally the ByWard Market (in Lower Town), Parliament Hill and the Golden Triangle (both in Centretown – Downtown) have been the focal points of the cultural scenes in Ottawa.[243] Modern thoroughfares such as Wellington Street, Rideau Street, Sussex Drive, Elgin Street, Bank Street, Somerset Street, Preston Street, Richmond Road in Westboro, and Sparks Street are home to many boutiques, museums, theatres, galleries, landmarks and memorials in addition to eating establishments, cafes, bars and nightclubs.[244]\n\n\nAs Canada's capital, Ottawa has played host to a number of significant cultural events in Canadian history, including the first visit of the reigning Canadian sovereign—King George VI, with his consort, Queen Elizabeth—to his parliament, on 19 May 1939.[245] VE Day was marked with a large celebration on 8 May 1945,[246] the first raising of the country's new national flag took place on 15 February 1965,[247] and the centennial of Confederation was celebrated on 1 July 1967.[248] Queen Elizabeth II was in Ottawa on 17 April 1982, to issue a royal proclamation of the enactment of the Constitution Act.[249] In 1983, Prince Charles and Diana Princess of Wales came to Ottawa for a state dinner hosted by then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.[250] In 2011, Ottawa was selected as the first city to receive Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge during their tour of Canada.[251]\n\n\n\nOttawa was featured in the short story collection *For Your Eyes Only*, by Ian Fleming.[252]\n\n![The National War Memorial](image)The National War Memorial\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Ottawa and List of designated heritage properties in Ottawa\n\nThere is one World Heritage Site in Ottawa, the Rideau Canal, along with 25 National Historic Sites of Canada in Ottawa, including the Château Laurier, the Parliament of Canada, Confederation Square, the former Ottawa Teachers' College and Laurier House. Many other properties of cultural value have been designated as having \"heritage elements\" by the City of Ottawa under Part IV of the *Ontario Heritage Act*.[253]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of attractions in Ottawa and List of museums in Ottawa\n\n![](image)The Canadian Museum of Nature is Canada's national museum of natural history and natural science.\n#### Performing and visual arts[edit]\n\n\nThe Ottawa Little Theatre, founded in 1913 as the Ottawa Drama League, is the longest-running community theatre company in Ottawa.[254] Since 1969, Ottawa has been the home of the National Arts Centre, a major performing arts venue that houses four stages and is home to the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra and Opera Lyra Ottawa.[255]\n\n\nEstablished in 1975, the Great Canadian Theatre Company specializes in the production of Canadian plays at a local level.[256] The cities museum landscape is notable for containing six of Canada's nine national museums, the Canada Agriculture and Food Museum, the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, the Canada Science and Technology Museum, Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian War Museum and National Gallery of Canada.[257] The National Gallery of Canada; designed by famous architect Moshe Safdie, it is a permanent home to the *Maman* sculpture.[258] The Canadian War Museum houses over 3.75 million artifacts and was moved to an expanded facility in 2005.[259] The Canadian Museum of Nature was built in 1905, and underwent a major renovation between 2004 and 2010, leading to a centrepiece Blue Whale skeleton, and the creation of a monthly nightclub experience, *Nature Nocturne*.[260][261][262]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nOttawa is home to a number of regional dishes. As a city with traditional French-Canadian roots, staples such as poutine are served throughout the city. However, many consider shawarma Ottawa's official dish;[263] the city contains more shawarma restaurants than anywhere else in Canada.[264] The city is also home to \"Ottawa-style\" pizza, consisting usually of a thicker doughy crust and slightly spicy pizza sauce, with the toppings baked under a heavy layer of cheese, keeping the toppings soft.[265] Beaver tails, a fried dough pastry, were first created in Ottawa in the 1970s. Le Cordon Bleu has a long established culinary arts institute in the central Ottawa neighbourhood of Sandy Hill, the only Le Cordon Bleu campus in North America.[266]\n\n![](image)Winterlude is an annual winter festival held in Ottawa.\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of festivals in Ottawa\n\nOttawa hosts a variety of annual seasonal activities—such as Winterlude, the largest festival in Canada,[267] and Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill and surrounding downtown area, as well as Bluesfest, Canadian Tulip Festival, Ottawa Dragon Boat Festival, Ottawa International Jazz Festival, Fringe Festival, Capital Pride, and CityFolk Festival, that have grown to become some of the largest festivals of their kind in the world.[268][269] In 2010, Ottawa's Festival industry received the IFEA \"World Festival and Event City Award\" for the category of North American cities with a population between 500,000 and 1,000,000.[270]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Sport in Ottawa and List of Ottawa parks\n\n![](image)TD Place Stadium is home to the CFL's Ottawa Redblacks and the CPL's Atlético Ottawa.\n### Professional sports[edit]\n\n\nSport in Ottawa has a history dating back to the 19th century. The city is currently home to five professional sports teams. The Ottawa Senators are a professional ice hockey team playing in the National Hockey League. The Senators history in Ottawa dates back to 1883, where the franchise would go on to win the Stanley Cup eleven times. The team is a member of the Atlantic Division and play their home games at the Canadian Tire Centre.[271]\n\n\nThe Ottawa Redblacks are a professional Canadian Football team playing in the Canadian Football League.[272] Formerly the Ottawa Rough Riders represented the city until 1996. With a history dating back to 1876, the team was one of the oldest and longest-lived professional sports teams in North America. The professional soccer club, Atlético Ottawa, play in the Canadian Premier League. The team was founded in by Spanish club Atlético Madrid, and along with the Redblacks, play their home games at TD Place Stadium.[273] The Ottawa Blackjacks are a professional basketball team, playing in the Canadian Elite Basketball League, out of the TD Place Arena.[274][275] The Ottawa Titans play professional baseball in the Frontier League at Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Park.[276] Ottawa was previously home to the Ottawa Lynx, a Triple-A club, as well as the Ottawa Champions, an independent baseball team in the Can-Am League.[277]\n\n\n\n### Collegiate sports[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Ottawa and Carleton University varsity teams compete in U Sports in various sports. Algonquin College and Collège La Cité teams compete in the OCAA.\n\n\nThe Carleton Ravens are nationally ranked in basketball and soccer.[278] Carleton's men's basketball program is regarded as the greatest of all time, having won 17 of the last 20 national championships.[279] The Ottawa Gee-Gees are nationally ranked in basketball and soccer.[280]\n\n\n\n### Non-professional and amateur sports[edit]\n\n\nSeveral non-professional teams also play in Ottawa, including the Ottawa 67's junior ice hockey team.[281]\nThe city is home to an assortment of amateur organized team sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball, curling, rowing, ultimate, and horse racing.[282] Casual recreational activities, such as skating, cycling, tennis, hiking, sailing, golfing, skiing, and fishing/ice fishing are also popular.[282]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: City of Ottawa\n\nFurther information: List of Ottawa municipal elections, Canadian federal election results in Ottawa, and List of embassies and high commissions in Ottawa\n\n![](image)Ottawa City Hall houses the seat of the local government.\nThe City of Ottawa is a single-tier municipality, meaning it is in itself a census division and has no county or regional municipality government above it, and has no subsidiary municipalities to provide municipal services.[283][284] Ottawa is governed by the 24-member Ottawa City Council consisting of 23 councillors each representing one ward and the mayor, Mark Sutcliffe as of the 2022 Ottawa municipal election, is elected in a citywide vote.[285]\n\n\nAlong with being the capital of Canada, Ottawa is politically diverse in local politics. Most of the city has traditionally supported the Liberal Party in federal elections.[286][287] The safest areas for the Liberals are the ones dominated by Francophones, especially in Vanier and central Gloucester.[286] Central Ottawa is usually more left-leaning, and the New Democratic Party have won ridings there.[288] Some of Ottawa's suburbs are swing areas, such as central Nepean. Another example of a swing area is Orleans, despite its often Liberal Party-aligned francophone population.[286] Ridings further outside the city centre, such as those including Kanata, Barrhaven and rural areas, tend to be more conservative, both fiscally and socially.[286] This is especially true in the former Townships of West Carleton, Goulbourn, Rideau and Osgoode, which are more in line with the conservative areas in the surrounding counties.[286] Rural parts of the former township of Cumberland, with a large number of Francophones, traditionally support the Liberal Party, though their support has recently weakened.[286]\n\n\nAt present, Ottawa is host to 130 embassies.[289] A further 49 countries accredit their embassies and missions in the United States to Canada.[289]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: OC Transpo, O-Train, List of airports in the Ottawa area, List of Ottawa roads, List of numbered roads in Ottawa, and List of bridges in Ottawa\n\n### Public transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An O-Train crossing the Rideau River. The O-Train is a light rail public transportation service provided by OC Transpo.\nOttawa's public transit system is managed by OC Transpo.[290] OC Transpo operates an integrated, multi-modal Rapid Transit system which includes:\n\n\n\n* The O-Train light rail system. The four line public rail system includes two existing lines, and two lines which are currently under construction.\n\t+ Line 1, (Confederation Line), is an east–west line which operates medium-capacity light rail vehicles and travels under the city's downtown core.[291]\n\t+ Line 2, (Trillium Line), is a north–south rail transit corridor which utilizes a mix of Stadler FLIRTs and Alstom Coradia LINTs connecting the south end of Ottawa to Line 1 at Bayview station.[292][293]\n\t+ Line 3, is an under construction mass-transit line that will run mostly in parallel to Line 1, splitting at Lincoln Fields station and continuing west.[294]\n\t+ Line 4, is an under-construction 4 km (2.5 mi) airport link connecting the Trillium Line to the Ottawa International Airport\n* A vast Bus rapid transit (BRT) system that uses a series of dedicated bus-only roadways named the Transitway, and reserved lanes on city streets and highways. The Transitway has long distances between stops and full station amenities (including platforms, walkways, fare gates, ticket booths, elevators and convenience stores). It connects Ottawa's suburbs to the inner city. The Rapid bus service network operates all day, 7 days a week, reaching the suburban communities of Kanata to the West, Barrhaven to the South-West, Orléans to the East, and South Keys to the South.[295]\n* Over 190 local bus routes served by a fleet of ordinary, articulated and double-decker buses.[295] Both OC Transpo and the Quebec-based Société de transport de l'Outaouais (STO) operate bus transit services between Ottawa and Gatineau. OC Transpo also operates a door-to-door bus service for disabled individuals known as ParaTranspo.[290] There is a proposed LRT system that could link Ottawa with Gatineau.[296]\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nThe Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport is the city's principal airport. There are also three main regional airports Gatineau-Ottawa Executive Airport, Ottawa/Carp Airport, and Ottawa/Rockcliffe Airport.[297]\n\n\n\n### Inter-city transportation[edit]\n\n\nOttawa station is the main inter-city train station operated by Via Rail. It is located 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) to the east of downtown in Eastway Gardens (adjacent to O-Train Tremblay station) and serves Via Rail's Corridor Route.[298][299] The city is also served by inter-city passenger rail service at Fallowfield station in the southwestern suburban community of Barrhaven.[300]\n\n\nIntercity bus services are currently provided by a number of carriers at various stops throughout the city, following the closure of the former Ottawa Central Station bus terminal on 1 June 2021. Major carriers include: Megabus, Ontario Northland, Autobus Gatineau,[301][302][303] and Orléans Express.[304]\n\n\n\n### Streets and highways[edit]\n\n\nThe City of Ottawa has over 12,200 km (7,600 mi) lane-kilometres of road, as well as a series of freeways. The primary freeways are the east–west provincial Highway 417 (designated as the Queensway and part of the Trans-Canada Highway), Ottawa-Carleton Highway 174 (formerly Provincial Highway 17), Highway 7, and the north–south provincial Highway 416 (designated as Veterans' Memorial Highway), which connects to other 400-Series highways via the 401.[305][306] From downtown there are also freeway connections to Autoroute 5 and Autoroute 50, in neighbouring Gatineau.[307]\n\n\nThe city also has several scenic parkways and promenades, such as the Kichi Zibi Mikan (formerly the Macdonald Parkway), Colonel By Drive, Queen Elizabeth Driveway, the Sir George-Étienne Cartier Parkway (formerly the Rockcliffe Parkway), and the Aviation Parkway. The National Capital Commission manages ceremonial routes linking key attractions on both sides of the Ottawa River, including Confederation Boulevard.[308]\n\n\n\n### Cycling and pedestrian network[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Capital Pathway is a multi-use trail interlinking sites throughout the National Capital Region.\nNumerous paved multi-use trails, mostly operated by the National Capital Commission and the city, wind their way through much of the capital, including along the Ottawa River, Rideau River, and Rideau Canal. These pathways are used for transportation, tourism, and recreation. Because many streets either have wide curb lanes or bicycle lanes, cycling is a mode of transportation used by up to 2.5% of citizens, including in winter. This is the largest percentage of any major Canadian city.[309][310][311] As of 31 December 2015, over 900 km (560 mi) of cycling facilities are found in Ottawa, including 435 km (270 mi) of multi-use pathways, 8 km (5.0 mi) of cycle tracks, 200 km (120 mi) of on-road bicycle lanes, and 257 km (160 mi) of paved shoulders.[312] 204 km (127 mi) of new cycling facilities were added between 2011 and 2014.[312]\n\n\nNumerous downtown streets are restricted for pedestrians only. The entire length of Sparks Street was turned into a pedestrian mall in 1966.[313] Since 1960, additional avenues, streets, and parkways, are reserved for pedestrian and bicycle use only on Saturdays, Sundays and on selected holidays and events.[314] In 2021 city council unanimously approved the Byward Market Public Realm Plan to make the market area more car-free and pedestrian friendly.[315] From 2009 to 2015 the NCC introduced the Capital Bixi bicycle-sharing system. This continued until the program was taken over by company VeloGo from 2015 to 2018, when the partnership ceased.[316][317] Scooter-sharing systems have since been introduced in the downtown and inner-city areas.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Ottawa\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Canada portal\n* ![flag](image)Ontario portal\n\n\n* Outline of Ottawa\n* World national capitals\n* List of Ottawa buildings\n* Geography of Ottawa\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Extreme high and low temperatures in the table below were recorded at Ottawa from March 1872 to October 1889 and at Ottawa CDA from November 1889 to present.\n2. **^** In early 2001, the Province of Ontario dissolved the former City of Ottawa by amalgamating it with eleven other municipalities to form a new City of Ottawa.

The city houses numerous foreign embassies, key buildings, organizations, and institutions of Canada's government; these include the Parliament of Canada, the Supreme Court, the residence of Canada's viceroy, and Office of the Prime Minister.[16]\n\n\nFounded in 1826 as Bytown, and incorporated as Ottawa in 1855,[17] its original boundaries were expanded through numerous annexations and were ultimately replaced by a new city incorporation and amalgamation in 2001. The municipal government of Ottawa is established and governed by the City of Ottawa Act of the Government of Ontario, and has an elected city council across 24 wards and a mayor elected city-wide.\n\n\nOttawa has the highest proportion of university educated residents among Canadian cities[18] and is home to a number of colleges and universities, research and cultural institutions, including the University of Ottawa, Carleton University, Algonquin College, the National Arts Centre, the National Gallery of Canada; and numerous national museums, monuments, and historic sites.[19] It is one of the most visited cities in Canada, with over 11 million visitors annually contributing more than $2.2B to the city's economy.[20][21]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe city name *Ottawa* was chosen in 1855 as a reference to the Ottawa River, the name of which is derived from the Algonquin *adawe*, meaning 'to trade'.[22][23] The city's modern name in Algonquin language is *Odàwàg*.[24] The Algonquin Anishinaabe previously occupied a large tract of land on which Ottawa was settled.[25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ottawa\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Ottawa history.\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Champlain Sea\nOttawa is situated on the traditional land of the Algonquins, a broad Indigenous people who are closely related to the Odawa and Ojibwe peoples.[26][27]\n\n\nThe Ottawa Valley became habitable around 10,000 years ago, following the natural draining of the Champlain Sea.[28][29] Archaeological findings of arrowheads, tools and pottery indicate that Indigenous populations first settled in the area about 6,500 years ago.[30][31] These findings suggest that these Algonquin people were engaged in foraging, hunting and fishing, but also trade and travel. Three major rivers meet within Ottawa, making it an important trade and travel area for thousands of years.[30] This period ended with the arrival of settlers and colonization of North America by Europeans during and after the 15th century.[32]\n\n\n\n### European exploration and early development[edit]\n\n\nIn 1610, Étienne Brûlé, became the first documented European to navigate the Ottawa River, passing what would become Ottawa on his way to the Great Lakes.[33] Three years later, Samuel de Champlain wrote about the waterfalls in the area and about his encounters with the Algonquin people.[34]\n\n\nThe first non-Indigenous settlement in the area was created by Philemon Wright, a New Englander. Wright founded a lumber town in the area on 7 March 1800 on the north side of the river, across from the present-day city of Ottawa in Hull.[35][36] He, with five other families and twenty-five labourers, also created an agricultural community, which was named Wrightsville.[37][38] Wright pioneered the Ottawa Valley timber trade (soon to be the area's most significant economic activity) by transporting timber by river from the Ottawa Valley to Quebec City.[39]\n\n\nIn 1826, news of the impending construction of the Rideau Canal by the British military led to land speculators founding a community on the south side of the Ottawa River.[40] The following year, the town was named after British military engineer Colonel John By who was responsible for the entire Rideau Waterway construction project.[41] The Rideau canal provided a secure route between Montreal and Kingston on Lake Ontario. It bypassed a vulnerable stretch of the St. Lawrence River bordering the state of New York that had left re-supply ships bound for southwestern Ontario easily exposed to enemy fire during the War of 1812.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Camp used by soldiers and labourers of the Rideau Canal, on the south side of the Ottawa River in 1826. The building of the canal attracted many land speculators to the area.\nColonel By set up military barracks on the site of today's Parliament Hill. He also laid out the streets of the town and created two distinct neighbourhoods named \"Upper Town\" west of the canal and \"Lower Town\" east of the canal. Similar to its Upper Canada and Lower Canada namesakes, historically \"Upper Town\" was predominantly English-speaking and Protestant whereas \"Lower Town\" was predominantly French, Irish and Catholic.[43][*page needed*]\n\n\nBytown's population grew to 1,000 as the Rideau Canal was being completed in 1832.[44][45] Bytown' early pioneer period saw Irish labour unrest during the Shiners' War from 1835 to 1845[46] and political dissension that was evident in the 1849 Stony Monday Riot.[47] In 1855, Bytown was renamed *Ottawa* and incorporated as a city.[23] William Pittman Lett was installed as the first city clerk, serving from 1844 to 1891, guiding Ottawa through 36 years of development, leading the hiring of key municipal roles, founding civic organizations, and proposing a set of by-laws for the city.[48][49][50]\n\n\n\n### Selection as capital[edit]\n\n\nSelection of Ottawa as the capital of Canada predates the Confederation of Canada. The selection was contentious and not straightforward, with the parliament of the United Province of Canada holding more than 200 votes over several decades to attempt to settle on a legislative solution to the location of the capital.[51]\n\n\nThe governor general of the province had designated Kingston as the capital in 1841. However, the major population centres of Toronto and Montreal, as well as the former capital of Lower Canada, Quebec City, all had legislators dissatisfied with Kingston. Anglophone merchants in Quebec were the main group supportive of the Kingston arrangement.[52] In 1842, a vote rejected Kingston as the capital, and study of potential candidates included the then-named Bytown, but that option proved less popular than Toronto or Montreal.[53] In 1843, a report of the Executive Council recommended Montreal as the capital as a more fortifiable location and commercial centre; however, the governor general refused to execute a move without a parliamentary vote.[54] In 1844, the Queen's acceptance of a parliamentary vote moved the capital to Montreal.[55]\n\n\nIn 1849, after violence in Montreal, a series of votes was held, with Kingston and Bytown both again considered as capitals. However, the successful proposal was for two cities to share capital status, and the legislature to alternate sitting in each: Quebec City and Toronto, in a policy known as perambulation.[56][57] Logistical difficulties made this an unpopular arrangement,[58] and although an 1856 vote passed for the lower house of parliament to relocate permanently to Quebec City, the upper house refused to approve funding.[59]\n\n\nThe funding impasse led to the ending of the legislature's role in determining the seat of government. The legislature requested the Queen make the determination of the seat of government. The Queen then acted on the advice of her governor general Edmund Head,[60] who, after reviewing proposals from various cities, selected the recently renamed Ottawa. The Queen sent a letter to colonial authorities selecting Ottawa as the capital, effective 31 December 1857. George Brown, briefly a co-premier of the Province of Canada, attempted to reverse this decision, but was unsuccessful. The Queen's choice was ratified by the Parliament in 1859, with Quebec serving as interim capital from 1859 to 1865.[51][61] The relocation process began in 1865, with the first session of Parliament held in the new buildings in 1866, and the buildings were generally well received by legislators.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ottawa in 1859, before construction on Parliament Hill. Two years prior, Queen Victoria selected the city as the permanent capital of the Province of Canada.\nOttawa was chosen as the capital for two primary reasons.[63] First, Ottawa's isolated location, surrounded by dense forest far from the Canada–US border and situated on a cliff face, would make it more defensible from attack.[64][65] Second, Ottawa was approximately midway between Toronto and Kingston (in Canada West) and Montreal and Quebec City (in Canada East) making the selection an important political compromise.[66][67]\n\n\nOther minor considerations included that despite Ottawa's regional isolation, there was water transportation access from spring to fall, both to Montreal via the Ottawa River, and to Kingston via the Rideau Waterway.[68] Additionally, by 1854 it also had a modern all-season railway (the Bytown and Prescott Railway) that carried passengers, lumber and supplies the 82 kilometres (50 miles) to Prescott on the Saint Lawrence River and beyond.[37][64] Ottawa's small size was also thought to be less prone to politically motivated mob violence, as had happened in the previous Canadian capitals.[69] Finally, the government already owned the land that eventually became Parliament Hill, which it thought would be an ideal location for the Parliament Buildings.[66]\n\n\nThe original Parliament buildings, which included the Centre, East and West Blocks, were constructed between 1859 and 1866 in the Gothic Revival style.[70] At the time, this was the largest North American construction project ever attempted and Public Works Canada and its architects were not initially well prepared for the relatively shallow-lying bedrock, and had to redesign architectural drawings, leading to delays. The Library of Parliament and Parliament Hill landscaping were completed in 1876.[71]\n\n\n\n### Post-Confederation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)LeBreton Flats after the 1900 Hull–Ottawa fire. The fire destroyed one-fifth of Ottawa and two-thirds of neighbouring Hull, Quebec.\nStarting in the 1850s, entrepreneurs known as lumber barons began to build large sawmills, which became some of the largest mills in the world.[72] Rail lines built in 1854 connected Ottawa to areas south and, from 1886, to the transcontinental rail network via Hull and Lachute, Quebec.[73] By 1885 Ottawa was the only city in Canada whose downtown street-lights were powered entirely by electricity.[74] In 1889, the Government developed and distributed 60 \"water leases\" (still in use) to mainly local industrialists which gave them permission to generate electricity and operate hydroelectric generators at Chaudière Falls.[75] Public transportation began in 1870 with a horsecar system,[76] overtaken in the 1890s by a vast electric streetcar system that operated until 1959.[77]\n\n\nThe Hull–Ottawa fire of 1900 destroyed two-thirds of Hull, including 40 percent of its residential buildings and most of the buildings of its largest employers along the waterfront.[78] It began as a chimney fire in Hull on the north side of the river, but due to wind, spread rapidly throughout the widespread wooden buildings. In Ottawa, it destroyed about one-fifth of the buildings from the Lebreton Flats south to Booth Street and down to Dow's Lake.[79][80] The fire had a disproportionate effect on west end lower-income neighbourhoods. It had also spread among many lumber yards, a major part of Ottawa's economy. The fire destroyed approximately 3200 buildings and caused an estimated $300 million in damage (in 2020 Canadian dollars).[81] An estimated 14% of Ottawans were left homeless.[82]\n\n\n\n![A sepia photograph from the fourth floor of a building, overlooking a triangular public plaza, many old cars with canvas tops are parked in the square. Neo-gothic buildings make up 2 borders of the square, and a set of tram tracks comprise the third](image)Ottawa Post Office, located in Confederation Square, pictured in the early 20th century\nOn 1 June 1912, the Grand Trunk Railway opened both the Château Laurier hotel and its neighbouring downtown Union Station.[83][84] On 3 February 1916, the Centre Block of the Parliament buildings was destroyed by a fire.[85] The House of Commons and Senate was temporarily relocated to the recently constructed Victoria Memorial Museum, now the Canadian Museum of Nature[86] until the completion of the new Centre Block in 1922. The centrepiece of the new Parliament Buildings is a dominant Gothic Revival-styled structure known as the Peace Tower.[87]\n\n\nThe location of what is now Confederation Square was a former commercial district centrally located in a triangular area downtown surrounded by historically significant heritage buildings which include the Parliament buildings. It was redeveloped as a ceremonial centre in 1938 as part of the City Beautiful Movement and became the site of the National War Memorial in 1939 and designated a National Historic Site in 1984.[88] A new Central Post Office (now the Privy Council of Canada) was constructed in 1939 beside the War Memorial because the original post office building on the proposed Confederation Square grounds had to be demolished.[89]\n\n\n\n### Post-Second World War[edit]\n\n\n![](image)V-Day, downtown Ottawa in 1945, to mark the end of World War II\n![](image)Greber plan's National Capital Greenbelt surrounding the urban core\n![](image)The John G. Diefenbaker Building was Ottawa's fourth city hall, from 1958 until 2001.\nOttawa's former industrial appearance was vastly altered by the 1950 Greber Plan.[90] Prime Minister Mackenzie King hired French architect-planner Jacques Greber to design an urban plan for managing development in the National Capital Region, to make it more aesthetically pleasing and a location more befitting for Canada's political centre.[91][92] Greber's plan included the creation of the National Capital Greenbelt, the Kichi Zibi Mikan and the Queensway highway system. His plan also called for changes in institutions such as moving downtown Union Station (now the Senate of Canada Building) to the suburbs, the removal of the street car system, the decentralization of selected government offices, the relocation of industries and removal of substandard housing from the downtown. The plan also recommended the creation of the Rideau Canal and Ottawa River pathways.[91][93][94]\n\n\nIn 1958, the National Capital Commission was established as a Crown Corporation through the National Capital Act. The commission's original mission was to implement the Greber Plan recommendations—which it conducted during the 1960s and 1970s.[95] This marked the creation of a permanent political infrastructure for managing the capital region. Prior attempts to do so in the previous 50 years had been temporary in nature. These included plans from the 1899 Ottawa Improvement Commission (OIC), the Todd Plan in 1903, the Holt Report in 1915 and the Federal District Commission (FDC) which was established in 1927 with a 16-year mandate.[96][97]\n\n\nFrom 1931 to 1958, City Hall had been at the Transportation Building adjacent to Union Station (now part of the Rideau Centre). In 1958 a new City Hall opened on Green Island near Rideau Falls where urban renewal had recently transformed this industrial location into green space.[98] In 2001, Ottawa City Hall returned downtown to a 1990 building on 110 Laurier Avenue West, the home of the now-defunct Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. This new location was close to Ottawa's first (1849–1877) and second (1877–1931) City Halls.[99] This new city hall complex also contained an adjacent 19th-century restored heritage building formerly known as the Ottawa Normal School.[98]\n\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, there was a large increase in construction in the National Capital Region,[100] which was followed by large growth in the high-tech industry during the 1990s and 2000s.[101] Ottawa became one of Canada's largest high-tech cities and was nicknamed Silicon Valley North. By the 1980s, Bell Northern Research (later Nortel) employed thousands, and large federally assisted research facilities such as the National Research Council contributed to an eventual technology boom. The early companies led to newer firms such as Newbridge Networks, Mitel and Corel.[102][103]\n\n\nIn 1991, provincial and federal governments responded to a land claim submitted by the Algonquins of Ontario, regarding the unceded status of the land on which Ottawa is situated.[104] Negotiations have been ongoing, with an eventual goal to sign a treaty that would release Canada from claims for misuse of land under Algonquin title, affirm rights of the Algonquins, and negotiate conditions of the title transfer.[105]\n\n\nOttawa's city limits have expanded over time, including a large expansion effective 1 January 2001, when the Province of Ontario amalgamated all the constituent municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton into a single city.[106] Regional Chair Bob Chiarelli was elected as the new city's first mayor in the 2000 municipal election, defeating Gloucester mayor Claudette Cain.[107] The city's growth led to strains on the public transit system and road bridges. On 15 October 2001, a diesel-powered light rail transit (LRT) line was introduced on an experimental basis. Known today as the Trillium Line, it was dubbed the O-Train and connected downtown Ottawa to the southern suburbs via Carleton University. The decision to extend the O-Train, and to replace it with an electric light rail system, was a major issue in the 2006 municipal elections, where Chiarelli was defeated by businessman Larry O'Brien.[108] After O'Brien's election, transit plans were changed to establish a series of light rail stations from the east side of the city into downtown, and for using a tunnel through the downtown core.[109] Jim Watson, the last mayor of Ottawa prior to amalgamation, was re-elected in the 2010 election.[110]\n\n\nIn October 2012, the City Council approved the final Lansdowne Park plan, an agreement with the Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group that saw a new stadium, increased green space, and housing and retail added to the site.[111][112] In December 2012, City Council voted unanimously to move forward with the Confederation Line, a 12.5 km (7.8 mi) light rail transit line, which was opened on 14 September 2019.[113]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Ottawa\n\n### Neighbourhoods[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of neighbourhoods in Ottawa\n\nThe present day city of Ottawa consist of the historic main urban area, as well as other urban, suburban and rural areas within the city's post-amalgamation limits.[114]\n\n\n\n#### Old Ottawa[edit]\n\n\nOld Ottawa refers to the former pre-amalgamation city, as well as the former city of Vanier, a densely populated, historically francophone, working class enclave, and the former village of Rockcliffe Park, a wealthy residential neighbourhood adjacent to the Prime Minister's official residence at 24 Sussex and the Governor General's residence.[115][116] The old city includes the downtown core and older neighbourhoods to the east, west, and south. These vibrant neighbourhoods include the bustling commercial and cultural areas of Old Ottawa South,\nCentretown, Lower Town, and Sandy Hill, the affluent tree lined neighbourhoods of The Glebe, Westboro, and New Edinburgh, and the historically blue-collar communities of Hintonburg, Mechanicsville, Carlington, and LeBreton Flats, with a mixture of housing types, artist lofts, and industrial uses. The old city also includes the ethnic enclaves of Chinatown and Little Italy.\n\n\n\n#### Suburbs and outlying communities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Ottawa showing urban areas and names of historical communities\nModern Ottawa is made up of eleven historic townships, ten of which are from the former Carleton County and one from the former Russell County.[117] Ottawa city limits are bounded on the east by the United Counties of Prescott and Russell; by Renfrew County and Lanark County in the west; on the south by the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville and the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry; and on the north by the Regional County Municipality of Les Collines-de-l'Outaouais and the City of Gatineau.[118][119]\n\n\nThe main suburban areas extend a considerable distance to the east, west and south of the inner-city.[120][121] These areas also include the former cities of Cumberland, Gloucester, Kanata and Nepean.[122] The towns of Stittsville and Richmond within the former Goulbourn Township are to the southwest.[115][123] Nepean as a suburb also includes Barrhaven.[115][124] The communities of Manotick and Riverside South are on the other side of the Rideau River, and Greely, southeast of Riverside South.[115]\n\n\nA number of rural communities (villages and hamlets) are administratively part of the Ottawa municipality.[120] Some of these communities are Burritts Rapids; Ashton; Fallowfield; Kars; Fitzroy Harbour; Munster; Carp; North Gower; Metcalfe; Constance Bay and Osgoode.[115] Several towns are within the federally defined National Capital Region but outside the city of Ottawa municipal boundaries;[120] these include communities of Almonte, Carleton Place, Embrun, Kemptville, Rockland, and Russell.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nOttawa above the Ottawa River in 2017, left to right— Byward Market **·** Fairmont Château Laurier **·** National Gallery of Canada **·** Rideau Canal Locks **·** Parliament Hill with Library of Parliament and Peace Tower **·** Alexandra Bridge **·** Downtown Ottawa towers **·** Supreme Court of Canada\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Ottawa\n\n![](image)Completed in 1913, the Connaught Building was constructed in a Gothic Revival style.\nInfluenced by government structures, much of the city's architecture tends to be formal and functional; the city is also marked by Romantic and Picturesque styles of architecture such as the Parliament Buildings' gothic revival architecture.[125] Ottawa's domestic architecture contains single-family homes, but also includes smaller numbers of semi-detached houses, rowhouses, and apartment buildings.[126] Many domestic buildings in Centretown are clad in red brick, with trim in wood, stone, or metal; variations are common, depending on the cultural heritage of the neighbourhoods and the time they were built.[127]\n\n\nThe skyline has been controlled by building height restrictions originally implemented to keep Parliament Hill and the Peace Tower at 92.2 m (302 ft) visible from most parts of the city.[128] Today, several buildings are slightly taller than the Peace Tower, with the tallest being the Claridge Icon at 143 metres (469 ft).[129] Many federal buildings in the National Capital Region are managed by Public Works Canada, which leads to heritage conservation in its renovations and management of buildings, such as the renovation of the Senate Building.[130][131] Most of the federal land in the region is managed by the National Capital Commission; its control of much undeveloped land and appropriations powers gives the NCC a great deal of influence over the city's development.[132][133][134]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nOttawa has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: *Dfb*)[135] with four distinct seasons and is between Zones 5a and 5b on the Canadian Plant Hardiness Scale.[136] The average July maximum temperature is 26.6 °C (80 °F). The average January minimum temperature is −14.4 °C (6.1 °F).[137] The highest temperature ever recorded in Ottawa was 37.8 °C (100 °F) on 4 July 1913, 1 August 1917 and 11 August 1944.[138][139]\n\n\nSummers are warm and humid in Ottawa. On average there are 11 days across the three summer months of June, July and August that have temperatures exceeding 30 °C (86 °F).[140]\n\n\nSnow and ice are dominant during the winter season. On average, almost every day of January, February and March, have more than 5 cm of snowpack (29, 28, and 22 days, respectively), and on average, approximately 12 days a year see 5 cm or more of snowfall, with 4 of those having over 10 cm.[140]\n\n\nAn average 17 days of the year experience temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F).[140] Spring and fall are variable, prone to extremes in temperature and unpredictable swings in conditions. The month of May, for example, sees a day below freezing about every other year, but sees days above 30 °C at about the same rate.[140]\n\n\nAnnual precipitation averages around 750mm per year.[140] Precipitation is spread throughout the year, with some variation. May through November are the months more likely to see precipitation and major precipitation events, with each month having an average of 3 days of over 1 cm of precipitation, with December through April seeing on average 1–2 days. May through November have on average over 8 cm of precipitation per month, with peaks of approximately 9 cm in June and September. December through April have less than 8 cm, with February being the driest month at an average of 5 cm of precipitation.[140]\n\n\n\nOttawa experiences about 2,080 hours of average sunshine annually (45% of possible).[140] Winds in Ottawa tend to come from the West, though eastward winds caused by lake-effect cells in afternoons are not unusual.[141] Winds tend to be slightly more dominant during the winter.[138][141]\n\n| Climate data for Ottawa (Central Experimental Farm), 1981–2010 normals, extremes 1872–present[a] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n |

|\n\n### Physical geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Downtown Ottawa is situated on the south bank of the Ottawa River with neighbouring Gatineau in the background across the river.\nOttawa is situated on the south bank of the Ottawa River and contains the mouths of the Rideau River and Rideau Canal.[153] The Rideau Canal (Rideau Waterway) first opened in 1832 and is 202 km (126 mi) long.[154] It connects the Saint Lawrence River on Lake Ontario at Kingston to the Ottawa River near Parliament Hill. It was able to bypass the unnavigable sections of the Cataraqui and Rideau rivers and various small lakes along the waterway due to flooding techniques and the construction of 47 water transport locks.\n\n\nOttawa is situated in a lowland on top of Paleozoic carbonate and shale, and is surrounded by more craggy Precambrian igneous and metamorphic formations. Ottawa has had fluvial deposition of till and sands, leading to the widespread formation of eskers. There are limited distinct features arising from glacial deposits, but Ottawa was affected by the Late Wisconsian advance. Prior to the draining of the Champlain Sea, the area had high salinity. After the draining of the sea, the area had pine-dominated forests.[155] Ottawa is located within the Western Quebec Seismic Zone, and while relatively inactive, the city does occasionally experience earthquakes.[156][157][158][159][160]\n\n\n\n### Built environment[edit]\n\n\nDuring part of the winter season the Ottawa section of the canal forms the world's largest skating rink, thereby providing both a recreational venue and a 7.8 km (4.8 mi) transportation path to downtown for ice skaters (from Carleton University and Dow's Lake to the Rideau Centre and National Arts Centre).[161] On 29 June 2007, the Rideau Canal was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[162]\n\n\nThe older part of the city (including what remains of Bytown) is known as Lower Town,[163] and occupies an area between the canal and the rivers. Across the canal to the west lie both Centretown and Downtown Ottawa, which share a border along Gloucester street.[164] These core neighbourhoods contain streets such as Elgin and Bank, which fill the role of commercial main streets in the region.[165]\n\n\nCentretown is next to downtown, which includes a substantial economic and architectural government presence across multiple branches of government. The legislature's work takes place in the parliamentary precinct, which includes buildings on Parliament Hill and others downtown, such as the Senate of Canada Building.[166] Important buildings in the executive branch include the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council as well as many civil service buildings.[167][168] The Supreme Court of Canada building can also be found in this area.[169]\n\n\nAcross the Ottawa River, which forms the border between Ontario and Quebec, lies the city of Gatineau, itself the result of amalgamation of the former Quebec cities of Hull and Aylmer.[170] Although formally and administratively separate cities in two separate provinces, Ottawa and Gatineau (along with a number of nearby municipalities) collectively constitute the National Capital Region, which is considered a single metropolitan area.[171] One federal Crown corporation, the National Capital Commission, or NCC, has significant land holdings in both cities, including sites of historical and touristic importance.[171] The NCC, through its responsibility for planning and development of these lands, has a key role in shaping the development of the city.[172] Around the main urban area is an extensive greenbelt, administered by the NCC for conservation and leisure, and comprising mostly forest, farmland and marshland.[173]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Ottawa\n\n![](image)Ottawa population pyramid in 2021\n\n\nHistoric Population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1901 | 101,102 | —     |\n| 1911 | 123,417 | +22.1% |\n| 1921 | 152,868 | +23.9% |\n| 1931 | 174,056 | +13.9% |\n| 1941 | 206,367 | +18.6% |\n| 1951 | 246,298 | +19.3% |\n| 1956 | 287,244 | +16.6% |\n| 1961 | 358,410 | +24.8% |\n| 1966 | 413,695 | +15.4% |\n| 1971 | 471,931 | +14.1% |\n| 1976 | 520,533 | +10.3% |\n| 1981 | 546,849 | +5.1% |\n| 1986 | 606,639 | +10.9% |\n| 1991 | 678,147 | +11.8% |\n| 1996 | 721,136 | +6.3% |\n| 2001 | 774,072 | +7.3% |\n| 2006 | 812,129 | +4.9% |\n| 2011 | 883,391 | +8.8% |\n| 2016 | 934,243 | +5.8% |\n| 2021 | 1,017,449 | +8.9% |\n| Note: Population figures are extrapolated for current municipal boundaries Sources:[174][175][176][177][178][b][180][8]Chart format |\n\n\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Ottawa had a population of 1,017,449 living in 407,252 of its 427,113 total private dwellings, a change of 8.9% from its 2016 population of 934,243. With a land area of 2,788.2 km2 (1,076.5 sq mi), it had a population density of 364.9/km2 (945.1/sq mi) in 2021.[181]\n\n\nAs of 2021 the Ottawa - Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) had a population of 1,488,307 living in 604,721 of its 638,013 total private dwellings, a change of 8.5% from its 2016 population of 1,371,576. With a land area of 8,046.99 km2 (3,106.96 sq mi), it had a population density of 185.0/km2 (479.0/sq mi) in 2021.[182]\n\n\nOttawa's median age of 40.1 is both below the provincial and national averages as of 2016. Youths under 15 years constituted 16.7% of the total population in 2016, while those of retirement age (65 years and older) made up 15.4%.[183]\n\n\nThe 2021 census reported that immigrants (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 259,215 persons or 25.9% of the total population of Ottawa. Of the total immigrant population, the top countries of origin were China (20,320 persons or 7.8%), India (16,200 persons or 6.2%), United Kingdom (14,760 persons or 5.7%), Lebanon (11,900 persons or 4.6%), Philippines (10,505 persons or 4.1%), United States of America (8,795 persons or 3.4%), Haiti (6,710 persons or 2.6%), Syria (6,370 persons or 2.5%), Vietnam (6,155 persons or 2.4%), and Iran (6,000 persons or 2.3%).[184]\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2016, approximately 69.1% of Ottawa's population was European, while 4.6% were aboriginal and 26.3% were visible minorities (higher than the national percentage of 22.3%).[185]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, religious groups in Ottawa included:[184]\n\n\n\n* Christianity (528,700 persons or 52.8%)\n* Irreligion (316,740 persons or 31.6%)\n* Islam (98,920 persons or 9.9%)\n* Hinduism (20,300 persons or 2.0%)\n* Buddhism (10,800 persons or 1.1%)\n* Judaism (10,600 persons or 1.1%)\n* Sikhism (6,375 persons or 0.6%)\n* Indigenous Spirituality (445 persons or <0.1%)\n* Other (8,055 persons or 0.8%)\n\n\nIn 2011[update], around 65% of Ottawa residents described themselves as Christian, with Catholics accounting for 38.5% of the population and members of Protestant churches 25%. Other religions are were also present in Ottawa, the largest being Islam (6.7%), Hinduism (1.4%), Buddhism (1.3%), and Judaism (1.2%). Those with no religious affiliation represent ed22.8%.[186]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nBilingualism became official policy for the conduct of municipal business in 2002,[187] and 37.6% of the population can speak both languages as of 2016, making it the largest city in Canada with both English and French as co-official languages.[188] Those who identify their mother tongue as English constitute 62.4 percent, while those with French as their mother tongue make up 14.2 percent of the population. In terms of respondents' knowledge of one or both official languages, 59.9 percent and 1.5 percent of the population have knowledge of English only and French only, respectively; while 37.2 percent have a knowledge of both official languages. The overall Ottawa–Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) has a larger proportion of French speakers than Ottawa itself, since Gatineau's population's first language is mostly French. However, Gatineau is also the most bilingual city in Canada, making the region one of the most bilingual. An additional 20.4 percent of the population list languages other than English and French as their mother tongue. These include Arabic (3.2%), Chinese (3.0%), Spanish (1.2%), Italian (1.1%), and many others.[186]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Ontario\n\n![](image)Federal government buildings in Tunney's Pasture\nAs of 2015, the region of Ottawa-Gatineau has the sixth-highest total household income of all Canadian metropolitan areas ($82,053), and the Ontario portion more directly overlapping the City of Ottawa has a higher household income ($86,451).[189] The median household income after taxes in the City of Ottawa is $73,745 in 2016 was higher than the national median of $61,348.[190] Ottawa's unemployment rate has remained below the national and provincial unemployment rates since 2006, with a rate of 5.2% in April 2022, low compared to the decade preceding.[191][192] In 2019 Mercer ranks Ottawa with the third highest quality of living of any Canadian city, and 19th highest in the world.[193] It is also rated the second cleanest city in Canada, and third cleanest city in the world.[194]\n\n\nOttawa's primary employers are the Public Service of Canada and the high-tech industry, although tourism and healthcare also represent increasingly sizeable economic activities. The federal government is the city's largest employer, employing over 116,000 individuals from the National Capital Region.[195] The national headquarters for many federal departments are in Ottawa, particularly throughout Centretown and in the Terrasses de la Chaudière and Place du Portage complexes in Hull. The National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa is the main command centre for the Canadian Armed Forces and hosts the Department of National Defence.[196] During the summer, the city hosts the Ceremonial Guard, which performs functions such as the Changing the Guard.[197]\n\n\nAs the national capital of Canada, tourism is an important part of Ottawa's economy, particularly after the 150th anniversary of Canada which was centred in Ottawa. The lead-up to the festivities saw much investment in civic infrastructure, upgrades to tourist infrastructure and increases in national cultural attractions.[198] The National Capital Region annually attracts an estimated 22 million tourists, who spend about 2.2 billion dollars and support 30,600 jobs directly.[199][200]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kanata Research Park is Canada's largest technology park.\nIn addition to the economic activities that come with being the national capital, Ottawa is an important technology centre; in 2015, its 1800 companies employed approximately 63,400 people.[201] The concentration of companies in this industry earned the city the nickname of \"Silicon Valley North\".[101] Most of these companies specialize in telecommunications, software development and environmental technology. Large technology companies such as Nortel, Corel, Mitel, Cognos, Halogen Software, Shopify and JDS Uniphase were founded in the city.[202] Ottawa also has regional locations for Nokia, 3M, Adobe Systems, Bell Canada, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.[203] Many of the telecommunications and new technology are in the western part of the city (formerly Kanata). The \"tech sector\" was doing particularly well in 2015/2016.[204][205]\nNordion, i-Stat and the National Research Council of Canada and OHRI are part of the growing life science sector.[206][207]\n\n\nThe health sector is another major employer, which employs over 18,000 people in the city.[208] Business, finance, administration, and sales and service rank high among types of occupations.[180] Approximately ten percent of Ottawa's GDP is derived from finance, insurance and real estate whereas employment in goods-producing industries is only half the national average.[209] The City of Ottawa is the second largest employer[210][211] with approximately 2,100 people employed by the Ottawa Police service, and 13,300 full-time equivalent non-police employees.[212][213]\n\n\nIn 2016, Ottawa experienced an increase of 10,000 jobs over 2012 average growth that was relatively slower than in the late 1990s.[195][214] All major clusters tracked by the city saw increases in employment between 2014 and 2019.[215] Major areas of growth in the 2010s included local and federal administration, finance and accommodation.[195] Between 2008 and 2020, there was growth in the number of government employees and a reduction in high-tech jobs, a reversal of previous trends from 2003 to 2008.[214][215]\n\n\nOttawa already has the largest rural economy among Canada's major cities.[216] In Ottawa, the rural economy contributes over $1 billion to the GDP. Agriculture alone accounts for $400 million, $136.7 million of which is farm-gate sales.[217] Rural economic activity includes agriculture, retail sales, construction, forestry and mining (aggregates), tourism, manufacturing, personal and business services, and transportation, to name a few. Rural employment expanded by a healthy 18% from 1996 to 2001.[216]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Media in Ottawa–Gatineau\n\nThree main daily local newspapers are printed in Ottawa: two English newspapers, the *Ottawa Citizen* established as *the Bytown Packet* in 1845 and the *Ottawa Sun*, and one French newspaper, *Le Droit*.[218][219] The city is also home to local stations of the television broadcast networks and systems CBC and CTV, as well as English and French radio stations.[220][221][222]\n\n\nIn addition to the market's local media services, Ottawa is home to several national media operations, including CPAC (Canada's national legislature broadcaster)[223] and the parliamentary bureau staff of virtually all of Canada's major newsgathering organizations in television, radio and print. The city is also home to the head office of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.[224]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of schools in Ottawa\n\n![](image)Established in 1848, the University of Ottawa is the oldest post-secondary institution in the city.\n![](image)Carleton University in 2022\n![](image)Saint Paul University\n### Primary and secondary education[edit]\n\n\nFour main public school boards exist in Ottawa: English, English-Catholic, French, and French-Catholic. The English-language Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) is the largest board with 147 schools,[225] followed by the English-Catholic Ottawa Catholic School Board with 85 schools.[226] The two French-language boards are the French-Catholic *Conseil des écoles catholiques du Centre-Est* with 49 schools,[227] and the French *Conseil des écoles publiques de l'Est de l'Ontario* with 37 schools.[228] Ottawa also has numerous private schools which are not part of a board.[229]\n\n\nThe Ottawa Public Library was created in 1906 as part of the Carnegie library system.[230] as of 2008[update] the library system had 2.3 million items at its 34 branches and two mobile libraries.[231] Approximately 9.5 million loans were conducted in 2020, approximately 6.7 million physical loans and the remainder digital items.[232]\n\n\n\n### Higher education and research[edit]\n\n\nOttawa is known as the most educated city in Canada, with over half the population having graduated from college and/or university.[233] Ottawa has the highest per capita concentration of engineers, scientists, and residents with PhDs in Canada.[234] The city has two main public universities, and two main public colleges.\n\n\n\n* Carleton University was founded in 1942 to meet the needs of returning World War II veterans and later became Ontario's first private, non-denominational college. Over time, Carleton transitioned into the highly ranked comprehensive university it is today.[235] The university's main campus sits between Old Ottawa South and Dow's Lake. Carleton's catholic affiliated university college, is the Dominican University College.[236]\n* The University of Ottawa (originally named the \"College of Bytown\") was the first post-secondary institution established in the city in 1848. The university later grew to become the largest English-French bilingual university in the world.[237] It is also a member of the U15, a group of highly respected research-intensive universities in Canada.[238] The university's main campus is in the Sandy Hill neighbourhood, just adjacent to the city's downtown core. The University of Ottawa's catholic affiliated university college is St. Paul University.\n* Algonquin College is a college of applied arts and technology, founded in 1967. Its main campus is located in the City View neighbourhood of College Ward.

Founded in 1989, its campus is located off the Aviation Parkway in the Carson Meadows neighbourhood. La Cité has satellite campus in Hawkesbury and a business office in Toronto.\n\n\nOther colleges and universities in the metropolitan area are located in the neighbouring suburb of Gatineau, including the University of Quebec in Outaouais, Cégep de l'Outaouais, and Heritage College.[240]\n\n\n\n## Public health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Civic Hospital is one of three main campuses of The Ottawa Hospital.\nSee also: List of hospitals in Ottawa\n\nThere are six active general medical hospitals in the city of Ottawa: The Queensway Carleton Hospital, The Ottawa Hospital (Civic Hospital, General Hospital, Riverside Hospital), Montfort Hospital, and Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Several specialized hospital facilities are also present, such as the world renown University of Ottawa Heart Institute, the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre, and Élisabeth Bruyère Hospital.[241] There are also several hospitals and major medical centres in neighbouring suburban communities and commuter towns. The University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine operates teaching hospitals in conjunction with partners throughout the city.[242]\n\n\nOttawa is headquarters to numerous major medical organizations and institutions such as Canadian Red Cross, Canadian Blood Services, Health Canada, Canadian Medical Association, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, Canadian Nurses Association, and the Medical Council of Canada.\n\n\n\n## Culture and contemporary life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ByWard Market is a retail and entertainment district in Downtown Ottawa.\nTraditionally the ByWard Market (in Lower Town), Parliament Hill and the Golden Triangle (both in Centretown – Downtown) have been the focal points of the cultural scenes in Ottawa.[243] Modern thoroughfares such as Wellington Street, Rideau Street, Sussex Drive, Elgin Street, Bank Street, Somerset Street, Preston Street, Richmond Road in Westboro, and Sparks Street are home to many boutiques, museums, theatres, galleries, landmarks and memorials in addition to eating establishments, cafes, bars and nightclubs.[244]\n\n\nAs Canada's capital, Ottawa has played host to a number of significant cultural events in Canadian history, including the first visit of the reigning Canadian sovereign—King George VI, with his consort, Queen Elizabeth—to his parliament, on 19 May 1939.[245] VE Day was marked with a large celebration on 8 May 1945,[246] the first raising of the country's new national flag took place on 15 February 1965,[247] and the centennial of Confederation was celebrated on 1 July 1967.[248] Queen Elizabeth II was in Ottawa on 17 April 1982, to issue a royal proclamation of the enactment of the Constitution Act.[249] In 1983, Prince Charles and Diana Princess of Wales came to Ottawa for a state dinner hosted by then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.[250] In 2011, Ottawa was selected as the first city to receive Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge during their tour of Canada.[251]\n\n\n\nOttawa was featured in the short story collection *For Your Eyes Only*, by Ian Fleming.[252]\n\n![The National War Memorial](image)The National War Memorial\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Ottawa and List of designated heritage properties in Ottawa\n\nThere is one World Heritage Site in Ottawa, the Rideau Canal, along with 25 National Historic Sites of Canada in Ottawa, including the Château Laurier, the Parliament of Canada, Confederation Square, the former Ottawa Teachers' College and Laurier House. Many other properties of cultural value have been designated as having \"heritage elements\" by the City of Ottawa under Part IV of the *Ontario Heritage Act*.[253]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of attractions in Ottawa and List of museums in Ottawa\n\n![](image)The Canadian Museum of Nature is Canada's national museum of natural history and natural science.\n#### Performing and visual arts[edit]\n\n\nThe Ottawa Little Theatre, founded in 1913 as the Ottawa Drama League, is the longest-running community theatre company in Ottawa.[254] Since 1969, Ottawa has been the home of the National Arts Centre, a major performing arts venue that houses four stages and is home to the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra and Opera Lyra Ottawa.[255]\n\n\nEstablished in 1975, the Great Canadian Theatre Company specializes in the production of Canadian plays at a local level.[256] The cities museum landscape is notable for containing six of Canada's nine national museums, the Canada Agriculture and Food Museum, the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, the Canada Science and Technology Museum, Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian War Museum and National Gallery of Canada.[257] The National Gallery of Canada; designed by famous architect Moshe Safdie, it is a permanent home to the *Maman* sculpture.[258] The Canadian War Museum houses over 3.75 million artifacts and was moved to an expanded facility in 2005.[259] The Canadian Museum of Nature was built in 1905, and underwent a major renovation between 2004 and 2010, leading to a centrepiece Blue Whale skeleton, and the creation of a monthly nightclub experience, *Nature Nocturne*.[260][261][262]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nOttawa is home to a number of regional dishes. As a city with traditional French-Canadian roots, staples such as poutine are served throughout the city. However, many consider shawarma Ottawa's official dish;[263] the city contains more shawarma restaurants than anywhere else in Canada.[264] The city is also home to \"Ottawa-style\" pizza, consisting usually of a thicker doughy crust and slightly spicy pizza sauce, with the toppings baked under a heavy layer of cheese, keeping the toppings soft.[265] Beaver tails, a fried dough pastry, were first created in Ottawa in the 1970s. Le Cordon Bleu has a long established culinary arts institute in the central Ottawa neighbourhood of Sandy Hill, the only Le Cordon Bleu campus in North America.[266]\n\n![](image)Winterlude is an annual winter festival held in Ottawa.\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of festivals in Ottawa\n\nOttawa hosts a variety of annual seasonal activities—such as Winterlude, the largest festival in Canada,[267] and Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill and surrounding downtown area, as well as Bluesfest, Canadian Tulip Festival, Ottawa Dragon Boat Festival, Ottawa International Jazz Festival, Fringe Festival, Capital Pride, and CityFolk Festival, that have grown to become some of the largest festivals of their kind in the world.[268][269] In 2010, Ottawa's Festival industry received the IFEA \"World Festival and Event City Award\" for the category of North American cities with a population between 500,000 and 1,000,000.[270]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Sport in Ottawa and List of Ottawa parks\n\n![](image)TD Place Stadium is home to the CFL's Ottawa Redblacks and the CPL's Atlético Ottawa.\n### Professional sports[edit]\n\n\nSport in Ottawa has a history dating back to the 19th century. The city is currently home to five professional sports teams. The Ottawa Senators are a professional ice hockey team playing in the National Hockey League. The Senators history in Ottawa dates back to 1883, where the franchise would go on to win the Stanley Cup eleven times. The team is a member of the Atlantic Division and play their home games at the Canadian Tire Centre.[271]\n\n\nThe Ottawa Redblacks are a professional Canadian Football team playing in the Canadian Football League.[272] Formerly the Ottawa Rough Riders represented the city until 1996. With a history dating back to 1876, the team was one of the oldest and longest-lived professional sports teams in North America. The professional soccer club, Atlético Ottawa, play in the Canadian Premier League. The team was founded in by Spanish club Atlético Madrid, and along with the Redblacks, play their home games at TD Place Stadium.[273] The Ottawa Blackjacks are a professional basketball team, playing in the Canadian Elite Basketball League, out of the TD Place Arena.[274][275] The Ottawa Titans play professional baseball in the Frontier League at Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Park.[276] Ottawa was previously home to the Ottawa Lynx, a Triple-A club, as well as the Ottawa Champions, an independent baseball team in the Can-Am League.[277]\n\n\n\n### Collegiate sports[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Ottawa and Carleton University varsity teams compete in U Sports in various sports. Algonquin College and Collège La Cité teams compete in the OCAA.\n\n\nThe Carleton Ravens are nationally ranked in basketball and soccer.[278] Carleton's men's basketball program is regarded as the greatest of all time, having won 17 of the last 20 national championships.[279] The Ottawa Gee-Gees are nationally ranked in basketball and soccer.[280]\n\n\n\n### Non-professional and amateur sports[edit]\n\n\nSeveral non-professional teams also play in Ottawa, including the Ottawa 67's junior ice hockey team.[281]\nThe city is home to an assortment of amateur organized team sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball, curling, rowing, ultimate, and horse racing.[282] Casual recreational activities, such as skating, cycling, tennis, hiking, sailing, golfing, skiing, and fishing/ice fishing are also popular.[282]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: City of Ottawa\n\nFurther information: List of Ottawa municipal elections, Canadian federal election results in Ottawa, and List of embassies and high commissions in Ottawa\n\n![](image)Ottawa City Hall houses the seat of the local government.\nThe City of Ottawa is a single-tier municipality, meaning it is in itself a census division and has no county or regional municipality government above it, and has no subsidiary municipalities to provide municipal services.[283][284] Ottawa is governed by the 24-member Ottawa City Council consisting of 23 councillors each representing one ward and the mayor, Mark Sutcliffe as of the 2022 Ottawa municipal election, is elected in a citywide vote.[285]\n\n\nAlong with being the capital of Canada, Ottawa is politically diverse in local politics. Most of the city has traditionally supported the Liberal Party in federal elections.[286][287] The safest areas for the Liberals are the ones dominated by Francophones, especially in Vanier and central Gloucester.[286] Central Ottawa is usually more left-leaning, and the New Democratic Party have won ridings there.[288] Some of Ottawa's suburbs are swing areas, such as central Nepean. Another example of a swing area is Orleans, despite its often Liberal Party-aligned francophone population.[286] Ridings further outside the city centre, such as those including Kanata, Barrhaven and rural areas, tend to be more conservative, both fiscally and socially.[286] This is especially true in the former Townships of West Carleton, Goulbourn, Rideau and Osgoode, which are more in line with the conservative areas in the surrounding counties.[286] Rural parts of the former township of Cumberland, with a large number of Francophones, traditionally support the Liberal Party, though their support has recently weakened.[286]\n\n\nAt present, Ottawa is host to 130 embassies.[289] A further 49 countries accredit their embassies and missions in the United States to Canada.[289]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: OC Transpo, O-Train, List of airports in the Ottawa area, List of Ottawa roads, List of numbered roads in Ottawa, and List of bridges in Ottawa\n\n### Public transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An O-Train crossing the Rideau River. The O-Train is a light rail public transportation service provided by OC Transpo.\nOttawa's public transit system is managed by OC Transpo.[290] OC Transpo operates an integrated, multi-modal Rapid Transit system which includes:\n\n\n\n* The O-Train light rail system. The four line public rail system includes two existing lines, and two lines which are currently under construction.\n\t+ Line 1, (Confederation Line), is an east–west line which operates medium-capacity light rail vehicles and travels under the city's downtown core.[291]\n\t+ Line 2, (Trillium Line), is a north–south rail transit corridor which utilizes a mix of Stadler FLIRTs and Alstom Coradia LINTs connecting the south end of Ottawa to Line 1 at Bayview station.[292][293]\n\t+ Line 3, is an under construction mass-transit line that will run mostly in parallel to Line 1, splitting at Lincoln Fields station and continuing west.[294]\n\t+ Line 4, is an under-construction 4 km (2.5 mi) airport link connecting the Trillium Line to the Ottawa International Airport\n* A vast Bus rapid transit (BRT) system that uses a series of dedicated bus-only roadways named the Transitway, and reserved lanes on city streets and highways. The Transitway has long distances between stops and full station amenities (including platforms, walkways, fare gates, ticket booths, elevators and convenience stores). It connects Ottawa's suburbs to the inner city. The Rapid bus service network operates all day, 7 days a week, reaching the suburban communities of Kanata to the West, Barrhaven to the South-West, Orléans to the East, and South Keys to the South.[295]\n* Over 190 local bus routes served by a fleet of ordinary, articulated and double-decker buses.[295] Both OC Transpo and the Quebec-based Société de transport de l'Outaouais (STO) operate bus transit services between Ottawa and Gatineau. OC Transpo also operates a door-to-door bus service for disabled individuals known as ParaTranspo.[290] There is a proposed LRT system that could link Ottawa with Gatineau.[296]\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nThe Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport is the city's principal airport. There are also three main regional airports Gatineau-Ottawa Executive Airport, Ottawa/Carp Airport, and Ottawa/Rockcliffe Airport.[297]\n\n\n\n### Inter-city transportation[edit]\n\n\nOttawa station is the main inter-city train station operated by Via Rail. It is located 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) to the east of downtown in Eastway Gardens (adjacent to O-Train Tremblay station) and serves Via Rail's Corridor Route.[298][299] The city is also served by inter-city passenger rail service at Fallowfield station in the southwestern suburban community of Barrhaven.[300]\n\n\nIntercity bus services are currently provided by a number of carriers at various stops throughout the city, following the closure of the former Ottawa Central Station bus terminal on 1 June 2021. Major carriers include: Megabus, Ontario Northland, Autobus Gatineau,[301][302][303] and Orléans Express.[304]\n\n\n\n### Streets and highways[edit]\n\n\nThe City of Ottawa has over 12,200 km (7,600 mi) lane-kilometres of road, as well as a series of freeways. The primary freeways are the east–west provincial Highway 417 (designated as the Queensway and part of the Trans-Canada Highway), Ottawa-Carleton Highway 174 (formerly Provincial Highway 17), Highway 7, and the north–south provincial Highway 416 (designated as Veterans' Memorial Highway), which connects to other 400-Series highways via the 401.[305][306] From downtown there are also freeway connections to Autoroute 5 and Autoroute 50, in neighbouring Gatineau.[307]\n\n\nThe city also has several scenic parkways and promenades, such as the Kichi Zibi Mikan (formerly the Macdonald Parkway), Colonel By Drive, Queen Elizabeth Driveway, the Sir George-Étienne Cartier Parkway (formerly the Rockcliffe Parkway), and the Aviation Parkway. The National Capital Commission manages ceremonial routes linking key attractions on both sides of the Ottawa River, including Confederation Boulevard.[308]\n\n\n\n### Cycling and pedestrian network[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Capital Pathway is a multi-use trail interlinking sites throughout the National Capital Region.\nNumerous paved multi-use trails, mostly operated by the National Capital Commission and the city, wind their way through much of the capital, including along the Ottawa River, Rideau River, and Rideau Canal. These pathways are used for transportation, tourism, and recreation. Because many streets either have wide curb lanes or bicycle lanes, cycling is a mode of transportation used by up to 2.5% of citizens, including in winter. This is the largest percentage of any major Canadian city.[309][310][311] As of 31 December 2015, over 900 km (560 mi) of cycling facilities are found in Ottawa, including 435 km (270 mi) of multi-use pathways, 8 km (5.0 mi) of cycle tracks, 200 km (120 mi) of on-road bicycle lanes, and 257 km (160 mi) of paved shoulders.[312] 204 km (127 mi) of new cycling facilities were added between 2011 and 2014.[312]\n\n\nNumerous downtown streets are restricted for pedestrians only. The entire length of Sparks Street was turned into a pedestrian mall in 1966.[313] Since 1960, additional avenues, streets, and parkways, are reserved for pedestrian and bicycle use only on Saturdays, Sundays and on selected holidays and events.[314] In 2021 city council unanimously approved the Byward Market Public Realm Plan to make the market area more car-free and pedestrian friendly.[315] From 2009 to 2015 the NCC introduced the Capital Bixi bicycle-sharing system. This continued until the program was taken over by company VeloGo from 2015 to 2018, when the partnership ceased.[316][317] Scooter-sharing systems have since been introduced in the downtown and inner-city areas.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Ottawa\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Canada portal\n* ![flag](image)Ontario portal\n\n\n* Outline of Ottawa\n* World national capitals\n* List of Ottawa buildings\n* Geography of Ottawa\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Extreme high and low temperatures in the table below were recorded at Ottawa from March 1872 to October 1889 and at Ottawa CDA from November 1889 to present.\n2. **^** In early 2001, the Province of Ontario dissolved the former City of Ottawa by amalgamating it with eleven other municipalities to form a new City of Ottawa.

It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special *comune* named *Comune di Roma Capitale*. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi),[2] Rome is the country's most populated *comune* and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy.[3] Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy.[4] Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world)[5] is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the \"Eternal City\".[6] Rome is generally considered to be the \"cradle of Western civilization and Christian culture\", and the centre of the Catholic Church.[7][8][9]\n\n\nRome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe.[10] The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis.[11] It was first called *The Eternal City* (Latin: *Urbs Aeterna*; Italian: *La Città Eterna*) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy.[12][13] Rome is also called \"Caput Mundi\" (Capital of the World). \n\n\nAfter the fall of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world.[14] In this way, Rome first became one of the major centres of the Renaissance[15] and then became the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism. Famous artists, painters, sculptors, and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. In 1871, Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, which, in 1946, became the Italian Republic.\n\n\nIn 2019, Rome was the 14th most visited city in the world, with 8.6 million tourists, the third most visited city in the European Union, and the most popular tourist destination in Italy.[16] Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.[17] The host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean[18] (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many multinational companies, such as Eni, Enel, TIM, Leonardo, and banks such as BNL. Numerous companies are based within Rome's EUR business district, such as the luxury fashion house Fendi located in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. The presence of renowned international brands in the city has made Rome an important centre of fashion and design, and the Cinecittà Studios have been the set of many Academy Award–winning movies.[19]\n\n\n\n\n## Name and symbol[edit]\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Ancient Romans' founding myth,[20] the name *Roma* came from the city's founder and first king, Romulus.[1]\n\n\nHowever, it is possible that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself.[21] As early as the 4th century, there have been alternative theories proposed on the origin of the name *Roma*. Several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its linguistic roots which however remain uncertain:[22]\n\n\n\n* From *Rumon* or *Rumen*, archaic name of the Tiber, which in turn is supposedly related to the Greek verb ῥέω (*rhéō*) 'to flow, stream' and the Latin verb *ruō* 'to hurry, rush';[b]\n* From the Etruscan word 𐌓𐌖𐌌𐌀 (*ruma*), whose root is *\\*rum-* \"teat\", with possible reference either to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins Romulus and Remus, or to the shape of the Palatine and Aventine Hills;\n* From the Greek word ῥώμη (*rhṓmē*), which means *strength*.[c]\n\n\n### Other names and symbols[edit]\n\n\nRome has also been called in ancient times simply \"Urbs\" (central city),[23] from *urbs roma*, or identified with its ancient Roman symbol of SPQR, the symbol of its in Rome constituted republican government. Furthermore Rome has been called Urbs Aeterna (The Eternal City), Caput Mundi (The Capital of the world), Throne of St. Peter and Roma Capitale.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Rome\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Rome.\n\n### Earliest history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Founding of Rome\n\nHistorical States\n\n\n> \n> Roman Kingdom 753–509 BC  \n> \n> Roman Republic 509–27 BC  \n> \n> Roman Empire 27 BC– 395 AD  \n> \n> Western Roman Empire 286–476  \n> \n> Kingdom of Italy 476–493  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 493–536  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 536–546  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 546–547  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 547–549  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 549–552  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 552–751  \n> \n> Kingdom of the Lombards 751–756  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 756–1798  \n> \n> ![](image) Roman Republic 1798–1799  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1799–1809  \n> \n> ![](image) First French Empire 1809–1814  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1814–1849  \n> \n> ![](image) Roman Republic 1849  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1849–1870  \n> \n> ![](image) Kingdom of Italy 1870–1943  \n> \n> ![](image) Italian Social Republic 1943–1944  \n> \n> ![](image) Kingdom of Italy 1944–1946  \n> \n> ![](image) Italian Republic 1946–present  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nWhile there have been discoveries of archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from approximately 14,000 years ago, the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.[10] Evidence of stone tools, pottery, and stone weapons attest to about 10,000 years of human presence. Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum. Between the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age, each hill between the sea and the Capitoline Hill was topped by a village (on the Capitoline, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).[24] However, none of them yet had an urban quality.[24] Nowadays, there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation (\"synoecism\") of several villages around the largest one, placed above the Palatine.[24] This aggregation was facilitated by the increase of agricultural productivity above the subsistence level, which also allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities. These, in turn, boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly Ischia and Cumae).[24] These developments, which according to archaeological evidence took place during the mid-eighth century BC, can be considered as the \"birth\" of the city.[24] Despite recent excavations at the Palatine hill, the view that Rome was founded deliberately in the middle of the eighth century BC, as the legend of Romulus suggests, remains a fringe hypothesis.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Legend of the founding of Rome[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Romulus and Remus and Romulus\n\n![](image)*Capitoline Wolf*, a sculpture of the mythical she-wolf suckling the infant twins Romulus and Remus\nTraditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth. The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf.[20] They decided to build a city, but after an argument, Romulus killed his brother and the city took his name. According to the Roman annalists, this happened on 21 April 753 BC.[26] This legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.[27]\nThis was accomplished by the Roman poet Virgil in the first century BC. In addition, Strabo mentions an older story, that the city was an Arcadian colony founded by Evander. Strabo also writes that Lucius Coelius Antipater believed that Rome was founded by Greeks.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Monarchy and republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ancient Rome, Roman Kingdom, and Roman Republic\n\n![](image)The Temple of Portunus, god of grain storage, keys, livestock and ports.[30] Rome, built between 120 and 80 BC\n![](image)The Roman Forum are the remains of those buildings that during most of ancient Rome's time represented the political, legal, religious and economic centre of the city and the neuralgic centre of all the Roman civilisation.[31]\nAfter the foundation by Romulus according to a legend,[26] Rome was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system, initially with sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin, later by Etruscan kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus.[26]\n\n\nIn 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an oligarchic republic. Rome then began a period characterised by internal struggles between patricians (aristocrats) and plebeians (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, Volsci, Aequi, and Marsi.[32] After becoming master of Latium, Rome led several wars (against the Gauls, Osci-Samnites and the Greek colony of Taranto, allied with Pyrrhus, king of Epirus) whose result was the conquest of the Italian peninsula, from the central area up to Magna Graecia.[33]\n\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean and the Balkans, through the three Punic Wars (264–146 BC) fought against the city of Carthage and the three Macedonian Wars (212–168 BC) against Macedonia.[34] The first Roman provinces were established at this time: Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, Hispania, Macedonia, Achaea and Africa.[35]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the optimates, representing the conservative part of the Senate, and the populares, which relied on the help of the plebs (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city. The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army, which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic. Because of this, in the second half of the second century and during the first century BC there were conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus,[36] and the war against Jugurtha,[36] there was a civil war from which the general Sulla emerged victorious.[36] A major slave revolt under Spartacus followed,[37] and then the establishment of the first Triumvirate with Caesar, Pompey and Crassus.[37]\n\n\nThe conquest of Gaul made Caesar immensely powerful and popular, which led to a second civil war against the Senate and Pompey. After his victory, Caesar established himself as dictator for life.[37] His assassination led to a second Triumvirate among Octavian (Caesar's grandnephew and heir), Mark Antony and Lepidus, and to another civil war between Octavian and Antony.[38]\n\n\n\n### Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Empire\n\n![](image)The Ancient-Imperial-Roman palaces of the Palatine, a series of palaces located in the Palatine Hill, express power and wealth of emperors from Augustus until the 4th century.\n![](image)The Imperial fora belong to a series of *monumental fora* (public squares) constructed in Rome by the emperors. Also seen in the image is Trajan's Market.\n![](image)The Temple of Claudius to the south (left) of the Colosseum (model of Imperial Rome at the Museo della civiltà romana in Rome)\nIn 27 BC, Octavian became *princeps civitatis* and took the title of Augustus, founding the principate, a diarchy between the *princeps* and the senate.[38] During the reign of Nero, two thirds of the city was ruined after the Great Fire of Rome, and the persecution of Christians commenced.[39][40][41] Rome was established as a de facto empire, which reached its greatest expansion in the second century under the Emperor Trajan. Rome was confirmed as caput Mundi, i.e. the capital of the known world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period. During its first two centuries, the empire was ruled by emperors of the Julio-Claudian,[42] Flavian (who also built an eponymous amphitheatre, known as the Colosseum),[42] and Antonine dynasties.[43] This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion, preached by Jesus Christ in Judea in the first half of the first century (under Tiberius) and popularised by his apostles through the empire and beyond.[44] The Antonine age is considered the zenith of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the Atlantic Ocean to the Euphrates and from Britain to Egypt.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Colosseum at night\nAfter the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235, the Empire entered into a 50-year period known as the Crisis of the Third Century during which there were numerous putsches by generals, who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260 to 274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions – Britain, Spain, and North Africa – were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The Germanic tribes along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s–280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The Persian Empire invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.[45] Emperor Diocletian (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the Tetrarchy which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level: whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed price controls which did not last. He or Constantine regionalised the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Vérone et la province de Grande-Arménie, Mélanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in Nicomedia. In 296, he elevated Maximian to *Augustus* of the western half, where he ruled mostly from Mediolanum when not on the move.[45] In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in Trier and Galerius in Sirmium in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they, in turn, appointed two colleagues for themselves.[45]\n\n\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306–313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalising the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325–330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called Edict of Milan of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of Byzantium into his new residence, which, however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; Constantinople.[46]\n\n\nChristianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the Edict of Thessalonica issued in the name of three emperors – Gratian, Valentinian II, and Theodosius I – with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, Arcadius and Honorius divided the empire into a western and an eastern part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to Ravenna in 408, but from 450 the emperors mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Visigoths sacking Rome in 410, by Joseph-Noël Sylvestre (1890), the first time in c. 800 years that Rome had fallen to a foreign enemy\nRome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, was sacked in 410 by the Visigoths led by Alaric I,[48] but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as artwork in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450–500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by Genseric, king of the Vandals.[49] The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of Romulus Augustus on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the Middle Ages.[46]\n\n\nThe decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443, and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatised.[50]\n\n\nHowever, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. The population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, the population dropped to 30,000 but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.[51] The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.[52] The figure of 450,000–500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.[53] Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Fall of the Western Roman Empire\n\n![](image)The Vandals sacking Rome in 455, by Karl Briullov (1830s)\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome was first under the control of Odoacer and then became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom before returning to East Roman control after the Gothic War, which devastated the city in 546 and 550. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to 500,000 in 273[54] to 35,000 after the Gothic War (535–554),[55] reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens.[56] It is generally thought the population of the city until 300 AD was 1 million (estimates range from 2 million to 750,000) declining to 750–800,000 in 400 AD, 450–500,000 in 450 AD and down to 80–100,000 in 500 AD (though it may have been twice this).[57]\n\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the Pope, was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles Peter and Paul there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter, who is considered the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the Catholic Church.\n\n\nAfter the Lombard invasion of Italy (569–572), the city remained nominally Byzantine, but in reality, the popes pursued a policy of equilibrium between the Byzantines, the Franks, and the Lombards.[58] In 729, the Lombard king Liutprand donated the north Latium town of Sutri to the Church, starting its temporal power.[58] In 756, Pepin the Short, after having defeated the Lombards, gave the Pope temporal jurisdiction over the Roman Duchy and the Exarchate of Ravenna, thus creating the Papal States.[58] Since this period, three powers tried to rule the city: the pope, the nobility (together with the chiefs of militias, the judges, the Senate and the populace), and the Frankish king, as king of the Lombards, patricius, and Emperor.[58] These three parties (theocratic, republican, and imperial) were a characteristic of Roman life during the entire Middle Ages.[58] On Christmas night of 800, Charlemagne was crowned in Rome as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III: on that occasion, the city hosted for the first time the two powers whose struggle for control was to be a constant of the Middle Ages.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Detail view on an illustration by Raphael portraying the crowning of Charlemagne in Old Saint Peter's Basilica, on 25 December 800\nIn 846, Muslim Arabs unsuccessfully stormed the city's walls, but managed to loot St. Peter's and St. Paul's basilica, both outside the city wall.[59] After the decay of Carolingian power, Rome fell prey to feudal chaos: several noble families fought against the pope, the emperor, and each other. These were the times of Theodora and her daughter Marozia, concubines and mothers of several popes, and of Crescentius, a powerful feudal lord, who fought against the Emperors Otto II and Otto III.[60] The scandals of this period forced the papacy to reform itself: the election of the pope was reserved to the cardinals, and reform of the clergy was attempted. The driving force behind this renewal was the monk Ildebrando da Soana, who once elected pope under the name of Gregory VII became involved into the Investiture Controversy against Emperor Henry IV.[60] Subsequently, Rome was sacked and burned by the Normans under Robert Guiscard who had entered the city in support of the Pope, then besieged in Castel Sant'Angelo.[60]\n\n\nDuring this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a *senatore* or *patrizio*. In the 12th century, this administration, like other European cities, evolved into the commune, a new form of social organisation controlled by the new wealthy classes.[60] Pope Lucius II fought against the Roman commune, and the struggle was continued by his successor Pope Eugenius III: by this stage, the commune, allied with the aristocracy, was supported by Arnaldo da Brescia, a monk who was a religious and social reformer.[61] After the pope's death, Arnaldo was taken prisoner by Adrianus IV, which marked the end of the commune's autonomy.[61] Under Pope Innocent III, whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy, the commune liquidated the senate, and replaced it with a *Senatore*, who was subject to the pope.[61]\n\n\nIn this period, the papacy played a role of secular importance in Western Europe, often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs and exercising additional political powers.[62][63][64]\n\n\nIn 1266, Charles of Anjou, who was heading south to fight the Hohenstaufen on behalf of the pope, was appointed Senator. Charles founded the Sapienza, the university of Rome.[61] In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in Viterbo, could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the conclave.[61] In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: Annibaldi, Caetani, Colonna, Orsini, Conti, nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pope Gregory XI returned to Rome in 1376 and ended the Avignon Papacy.\nPope Boniface VIII, born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's universal domain; he proclaimed a crusade against the Colonna family and, in 1300, called for the first Jubilee of Christianity, which brought millions of pilgrims to Rome.[61] However, his hopes were crushed by the French king Philip the Fair, who took him prisoner and killed him in Anagni.[61] Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was briefly relocated to Avignon (1309–1377).[65] During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, Cola di Rienzo, came to power.[65] An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of *Tribuno*, his reforms were rejected by the populace.[65] Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal Albornoz, who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.[65] Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under Gregory XI.[65] The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the Western Schism (1377–1418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.[65]\n\n\n\n### Early modern history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Renaissance\n\n![](image)Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by Mario Cartaro (from 1575) shows the city's primary monuments.\n![](image)Castel Sant'Angelo, or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.\n![](image)Fontana della Barcaccia was created by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1629.\nIn 1418, the Council of Constance settled the Western Schism, and a Roman pope, Martin V, was elected.[65] This brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the Renaissance.[65] The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from Nicholas V, founder of the Vatican Library, to Pius II, humanist and literate, from Sixtus IV, a warrior pope, to Alexander VI, immoral and nepotist, from Julius II, soldier and patron, to Leo X, who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.[65]\n\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the Italian Renaissance moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new Saint Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and *Ponte Sisto* (the first bridge to be built across the Tiber since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the Popes engaged the best artists of the time, including Michelangelo, Perugino, Raphael, Ghirlandaio, Luca Signorelli, Botticelli, and Cosimo Rosselli.\n\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and engaging in nepotism and simony. The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the Reformation and, in turn, the Counter-Reformation. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\n\nThe Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the Pietà by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the Borgia Apartments. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under Pope Julius II (1503–1513) and his successors Leo X and Clement VII, both members of the Medici family.\n\n\n\n![](image)Carnival in Rome, c. 1650, by Johannes Lingelbach\n![](image)*A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome*, by Hendrik Frans van Lint, c. 1730\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world. The old St. Peter's Basilica built by Emperor Constantine the Great[66] (which by then was in a dilapidated state) was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists like Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli and Bramante, who built the temple of San Pietro in Montorio and planned a great project to renovate the Vatican. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the Villa Farnesina, the Raphael's Rooms, plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the Moses for the tomb of Julius II.\n\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including Agostino Chigi, who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The War of the League of Cognac caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since the previous sack; in 1527, the Landsknechts of Emperor Charles V sacked the city, bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.[65]\n\n\nBeginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.[65] Under the popes from Pius IV to Sixtus V, Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.[67] The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.[67]\n\n\nThis was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families (Barberini, Pamphili, Chigi, Rospigliosi, Altieri, Odescalchi) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.[67] During the Age of Enlightenment, new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.[65] But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the Jesuit order suppressed.[65]\n\n\n\n### Late modern and contemporary[edit]\n\n\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived Roman Republic (1798–1800), which was established under the influence of the French Revolution. The Papal States were restored in June 1800, but during Napoleon's reign Rome was annexed as a *Département* of the French Empire: first as *Département du Tibre* (1808–1810) and then as *Département Rome* (1810–1814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the Congress of Vienna of 1814.\n\n\nIn 1849, a second Roman Republic was proclaimed during a year of revolutions in 1848. Two of the most influential figures of the Italian unification, Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi, fought for the short-lived republic.\n\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 with the temporary capital in Florence. That year Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of Napoleon III. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. In 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. Italian troops were able to capture Rome entering the city through a breach near Porta Pia. Pope Pius IX declared himself a prisoner in the Vatican. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.[68] In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bombardment of Rome by Allied planes, 1943\nSoon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of Italian Fascism led by Benito Mussolini, who led a march on the city. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new Italian Empire and allying Italy with Nazi Germany in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city centre in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.[69] The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943, the San Lorenzo district was subject to Allied bombing raids, resulting in about 3,000 fatalities and 11,000 injuries, of whom another 1,500 died.[70] Mussolini was arrested on 25 July 1943. On the date of the Italian Armistice 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an open city. It was liberated on 4 June 1944.\n\n\nRome developed greatly after the war as part of the \"Italian economic miracle\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of *la dolce vita* (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as *Ben Hur*, *Quo Vadis*, *Roman Holiday* and *La Dolce Vita* filmed in the city's iconic Cinecittà Studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s when the *comune* had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Rome\nRome is in the Lazio region of central Italy on the Tiber (Italian: *Tevere*) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the Tiber Island, the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the Aventine Hill, the Caelian Hill, the Capitoline Hill, the Esquiline Hill, the Palatine Hill, the Quirinal Hill, and the Viminal Hill. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the Aniene, which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\n\nAlthough the city centre is about 24 km (15 mi) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea, the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of Ostia is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from 13 m (43 ft) above sea level (at the base of the Pantheon) to 139 m (456 ft) above sea level (the peak of Monte Mario).[71] The *Comune* of Rome covers an overall area of about 1,285 km2 (496 sq mi), including many green areas.\n\n\n\n### Parks and gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of parks and gardens in Rome\n\n![](image)The Temple of Aesculapius, in the Villa Borghese gardens\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.[72] The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are the Villa Borghese, Villa Ada, and Villa Doria Pamphili. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill, comprising some 1.8 km2 (0.7 sq mi). The Villa Sciarra is on the hill, with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere, the Orto Botanico (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush Villa Celimontana, close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of Pincio and Villa Medici. There is also a notable pine wood at Castelfusano, near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin, including the Pineto Regional Park and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Rome\n\n![](image)Stone pines in the Villa Doria Pamphili\nRome has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: *Csa*),[73] with hot, dry summers and mild, humid winters.\n\n\nIts average annual temperature is above 21 °C (70 °F) during the day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. In the coldest month, January, the average temperature is 12.6 °C (54.7 °F) during the day and 2.1 °C (35.8 °F) at night. In the warmest month, August, the average temperature is 31.7 °C (89.1 °F) during the day and 17.3 °C (63.1 °F) at night.\n\n\nDecember, January and February are the coldest months, with a daily mean temperature of approximately 8 °C (46 °F). Temperatures during these months generally vary between 10 and 15 °C (50 and 59 °F) during the day and between 3 and 5 °C (37 and 41 °F) at night, with colder or warmer spells occurring frequently. Snowfall is rare but not unheard of, with light snow or flurries occurring on some winters, generally without accumulation, and major snowfalls on a very rare occurrence (the most recent ones were in 2018, 2012 and 1986).[74][75][76]\n\n\nThe average relative humidity is 75%, varying from 72% in July to 77% in November. Sea temperatures vary from a low of 13.9 °C (57.0 °F) in February to a high of 25.0 °C (77.0 °F) in August.[77]\n\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Rome was 42.9 °C (109.2 °F) on 18 July 2023.[78]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Rome Ciampino Airport, elevation: 129 m or 423 ft, 1991-2020 normals, extremes 1944–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 39.7(103.5)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 40.0(104.0)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 12.7(54.9)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −2.4(27.7)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 4.3(39.7)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | −5.2(22.6)\n | −6.6(20.1)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 65.6(2.58)\n | 62.8(2.47)\n | 58.6(2.31)\n | 68.6(2.70)\n | 56.9(2.24)\n | 30.1(1.19)\n | 19.8(0.78)\n | 30.2(1.19)\n | 64.9(2.56)\n | 88.1(3.47)\n | 108.2(4.26)\n | 98.3(3.87)\n | 752.0(29.61)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 7.40\n | 7.48\n | 6.85\n | 7.42\n | 5.54\n | 3.38\n | 2.16\n | 2.20\n | 6.00\n | 7.32\n | 8.84\n | 9.44\n | 74.03\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 75.8\n | 71.5\n | 70.6\n | 70.4\n | 69.0\n | 65.4\n | 63.3\n | 64.1\n | 69.1\n | 74.0\n | 77.9\n | 77.2\n | 70.7\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 155.9\n | 171.9\n | 203.1\n | 221.1\n | 276.5\n | 298.8\n | 337.6\n | 320.2\n | 237.9\n | 200.6\n | 153.3\n | 146.9\n | 2,723.9\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA[79] |\n| Source 2: Temperature estreme in Toscana[80] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Demographics of Italy\n\n![](image)Rome (comune) age-sex pyramid in 2022\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1861  | 194,500 | —     |\n| 1871  | 212,432 | +9.2% |\n| 1881  | 273,952 | +29.0% |\n| 1901  | 422,411 | +54.2% |\n| 1911  | 518,917 | +22.8% |\n| 1921  | 660,235 | +27.2% |\n| 1931  | 930,926 | +41.0% |\n| 1936  | 1,150,589 | +23.6% |\n| 1951  | 1,651,754 | +43.6% |\n| 1961  | 2,188,160 | +32.5% |\n| 1971  | 2,781,993 | +27.1% |\n| 1981  | 2,840,259 | +2.1% |\n| 1991  | 2,775,250 | −2.3% |\n| 2001  | 2,663,182 | −4.0% |\n| 2011  | 2,617,175 | −1.7% |\n| 2021  | 2,770,226 | +5.8% |\n| Source: ISTAT, 2022 |\n\n\nIn 550 BC, Rome was the second largest city in Italy, with Tarentum being the largest.[*citation needed*] It had an area of about 285 ha (700 acres) and an estimated population of 35,000. Other sources suggest the population was just under 100,000 from 600 to 500 BC.[81][82] When the Republic was founded in 509 BC the census recorded a population of 130,000.[83] The republic included the city itself and the immediate surroundings. Other sources suggest a population of 150,000 in 500 BC. It surpassed 300,000 in 150 BC.[84][85][86][87][88]\n\n\nThe size of the city at the time of the Emperor Augustus is a matter of speculation, with estimates based on grain distribution, grain imports, aqueduct capacity, city limits, population density, census reports, and assumptions about the number of unreported women, children and slaves providing a very wide range. Glenn Storey estimates 450,000 people, Whitney Oates estimates 1.2 million, Neville Morely provides a rough estimate of 800,000 and excludes earlier suggestions of 2 million.[89][90][91][92] Estimates of the city's population towards and after the end of the Roman empire also vary. A.H.M. Jones estimated the population at 650,000 in the mid-fifth century. The damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated. The population had already started to decline from the late fourth century onward, although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire.[93] According to Krautheimer it was still close to 800,000 in 400 AD; had declined to 500,000 by 452, and dwindled to perhaps 100,000 in 500 AD. After the Gothic Wars, 535–552, the population may have dwindled temporarily to 30,000. During the pontificate of Pope Gregory I (590–604), it may have reached 90,000, augmented by refugees.[94] Lancon estimates 500,000 based on the number of 'incisi' enrolled as eligible to receive bread, oil and wine rations; the number fell to 120,000 in the reform of 419.[95] Neil Christie, citing free rations for the poorest, estimated 500,000 in the mid-fifth century and still a quarter of a million at the end of the century.[96] Novel 36 of Emperor Valentinian III records 3.629 million pounds of pork to be distributed to the needy at 5 lbs. per month for the five winter months, sufficient for 145,000 recipients. This has been used to suggest a population of just under 500,000. Supplies of grain remained steady until the seizure of the remaining provinces of North Africa in 439 by the Vandals, and may have continued to some degree afterwards for a while. The city's population declined to less than 50,000 people in the Early Middle Ages from 700 AD onward. It continued to stagnate or shrink until the Renaissance.[97]\n\n\nWhen the Kingdom of Italy annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 225,000. Less than half the city within the walls was built up in 1881 when the population recorded was 275,000. This increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I. The Fascist regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.[*citation needed*][*clarification needed*] Population growth continued after the Second World War, helped by a post-war economic boom. A construction boom also created many suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nIn mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2 million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800 inhabitants/km2 stretching over more than 5,000 km2 (1,900 sq mi)). Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00% of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56%.[98] The current[*when?*] birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe urban area of Rome extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 3.9 million.[99] Between 3.2 and 4.2 million people live in the Rome metropolitan area.[100][101][102][103][104]\n\n\n\n### Origin groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Esquilino *rione*\nAccording to the latest statistics conducted by ISTAT,[105] approximately 9.5% of the population consists of non-Italians. About half of the immigrant population consists of those of various other European origins (chiefly Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Albanian) numbering a combined total of 131,118 or 4.7% of the population. The remaining 4.8% are those with non-European origins, chiefly Filipinos (26,933), Bangladeshis (12,154), and Chinese (10,283).\n\n\nThe Esquilino *rione*, off Termini Railway Station, has evolved into a largely immigrant neighbourhood. It is perceived as Rome's Chinatown. Immigrants from more than a hundred different countries reside there. A commercial district, Esquilino contains restaurants featuring many kinds of international cuisine. There are wholesale clothes shops. Of the 1,300 or so commercial premises operating in the district 800 are Chinese-owned; around 300 are run by immigrants from other countries around the world; 200 are owned by Italians.[106]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Roman dialect and Latin\n\n![](image)Advertisement in Romanesco dialect at a subway station in Rome\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive, however. Through the process of Romanization, the peoples of Italy, Gallia, the Iberian Peninsula and Dacia developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonisation and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the Norman Conquest, borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The Roman or Latin alphabet is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.[107]\n\n\nThe medieval Roman dialect belonged to the southern family of Italian dialects, and was thus much closer to the Neapolitan language than to the Florentine.[108][109] A typical example of Romanesco of that period is *Vita di Cola di Rienzo [it]* (\"Life of Cola di Rienzo\"), written by an anonymous Roman during the 14th century.[108] Starting with the 16th century, the Roman dialect underwent a stronger and stronger influence from the Tuscan dialect (from which modern Italian derives) starting with the reigns of the two Medici popes (Leo X and Clement VII) and with the Sack of Rome in 1527, two events which provoked a large immigration from Tuscany.[110][111] Therefore, current Romanesco has grammar and roots that are rather different from other dialects in Central Italy.[111]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Rome\n\nSee also: Vatican City\n\n![](image)Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, Rome's Cathedral, built in 324, and partly rebuilt between 1660 and 1734\n![](image)Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome and the largest Catholic Marian church in Rome\nMuch like the rest of Italy, Rome is predominantly Christian, and the city has been an important centre of religion and pilgrimage for centuries, the base of the ancient Roman religion with the pontifex maximus and later the seat of the Vatican and the pope. Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the Religio Romana (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were Jupiter, the Most High, and Mars, the god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, Romulus and Remus, according to tradition. Other deities such as Vesta and Minerva were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as Mithraism. Later, after St Peter and St Paul were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the Old St. Peter's Basilica was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the Avignon papacy), Rome has for centuries been the home of the Roman Catholic Church and the Bishop of Rome, otherwise known as the Pope.\n\n\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the Vatican City and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, the Basilica di San Clemente, San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane and the Church of the Gesù. There are also the ancient Catacombs of Rome underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the Pontifical Lateran University, Pontifical Biblical Institute, Pontifical Gregorian University, and Pontifical Oriental Institute.\n\n\nSince the end of the Roman Republic, Rome is also the centre of an important Jewish community,[112] which was once based in Trastevere, and later in the Roman Ghetto. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the *Tempio Maggiore*.\n\n\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the *Mons Vaticanus* (Vatican Hill), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman rione of Borgo until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the Tiber, the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV, later expanded by the current fortification walls of Paul III, Pius IV, and Urban VIII. When the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. \n\n\nRome has been a major Christian pilgrimage site since the Middle Ages. People from all over the Christian world visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The city became a major pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the Middle Ages, Rome kept its status as Papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the Papacy briefly relocated to Avignon (1309–1377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter. Pilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the Pilate's stairs: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the praetorium of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem, which Jesus Christ stood on during his Passion on his way to trial.[113]\n\n\n\n![Panorama of St. Peter's Square](image)\nSt. Peter's Square in Vatican City\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mayor of Rome, City Council of Rome, Elections in Rome, and Administrative subdivisions of Rome\n\n![](image)Current seat of the Mayor of Rome, *Palazzo Senatorio* on Capitoline Hill.\n![](image)The Palazzo del Quirinale, now seat of the President of the Italian Republic\nRome constitutes a comune *speciale*, named *\"Roma Capitale\"*,[114] and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 *comuni* of Italy. It is governed by a mayor and a city council. The seat of the *comune* is the *Palazzo Senatorio* on the Capitoline Hill, the historic seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as *\"Campidoglio\"*, the Italian name of the hill.\n\n\nSince 1972, the city has been divided into administrative areas, called *municipi* (sing. *municipio*) (until 2001 named *circoscrizioni*).[115] They were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation in the city. Each *municipio* is governed by a president and a council of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years. The *municipi* frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city. The municipi were originally 20, then 19,[116] and in 2013, their number was reduced to 15.[117]\n\n\nRome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 *rioni*, all of which are located within the Aurelian Walls except Prati and Borgo. These originate from the 14 regions of Augustan Rome, which evolved in the Middle Ages into the medieval rioni.[118] In the Renaissance, under Pope Sixtus V, they again reached fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under Pope Benedict XIV in 1743.\n\n\nRome is the principal town of the Metropolitan City of Rome, operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old provincia di Roma, which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until Civitavecchia. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At 5,352 km2 (2,066 sq mi), its dimensions are comparable to the region of Liguria. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the Lazio region.[119]\n\n\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the Italian Government. The official residences of the President of the Italian Republic and the Italian Prime Minister, the seats of both houses of the Italian Parliament and that of the Italian Constitutional Court are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in Palazzo della Farnesina near the Olympic stadium.\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)FAO headquarters in Rome, Circo Massimo\nAmong the global cities, Rome is unique in having two sovereign entities located entirely within its city limits, the Holy See, represented by the Vatican City State, and the territorially smaller Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian capital city and a sovereign possession of the Holy See, which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the Roman Catholic Church. For this reason, Rome has sometimes been described as the capital of two states.[120][121] Rome is the seat of the so-called \"Polo Romano\" made up by three main international agencies of the United Nations: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).[122]\n\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The Treaties of the EU are located in Palazzo della Farnesina. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (predecessor to the European Union), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed European Constitution in July 2004. Rome is the seat of the European Olympic Committee and of the NATO Defense College. The city is the place where the Statute of the International Criminal Court and the European Convention on Human Rights were formulated. The city hosts also other important international entities such as the IDLO (International Development Law Organisation), the ICCROM (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the UNIDROIT (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n\n\n#### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Italy\n\nSince 9 April 1956, Rome is exclusively and reciprocally twinned only with:\n\n\n\n* ![France](image) Paris, France, 1956\n\n\n*Solo Parigi è degna di Roma; solo Roma è degna di Parigi.* (in Italian)\n*Seule Paris est digne de Rome; seule Rome est digne de Paris.* (in French)\n\"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris.\"[123][124][125][126][127]\nRome's other partner cities are:[128]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Achacachi, Bolivia[128]\n* ![](image) Algiers, Algeria[128]\n* ![](image) Beijing, China[129][130]\n* ![](image) Belgrade, Serbia[128]\n* ![](image) Brasília, Brazil[128]\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina[128]\n* ![](image) Cairo, Egypt[128]\n* ![](image) Cincinnati, United States[128]\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine[128]\n* ![](image) Kobanî, Syria[131]\n* ![](image) Kraków, Poland[132]\n* ![](image) Madrid, Spain[133]\n* ![](image) Multan, Pakistan[134]\n* ![](image) New Delhi, India[128]\n* ![](image) New York City, United States[135]\n* ![](image) Plovdiv, Bulgaria[128]\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea[136][137]\n* ![](image) Sydney, Australia[128]\n* ![](image) Tirana, Albania[138][139]\n* ![](image) Tehran, Iran[128]\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan[140]\n* ![](image) Tongeren, Belgium[128]\n* ![](image) Tunis, Tunisia[141]\n* ![](image) Washington, D.C., United States[142]\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Rome\n\n![](image)Palazzo Eni, in the EUR business district, headquarters of Eni, considered one of the world's oil and gas \"supermajors\".[143]\n![](image)Enel's headquarters in Rome, the second largest power company in the world by revenue after the State Grid Corporation of China.[144]\n![](image)Orizzonte Europa, BNL headquarters in Rome\nAs the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single *Ministeri*), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City. Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones, such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, and the German Archaeological Institute. There are also specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Rome also hosts major international and worldwide political and cultural organisations, such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Food Programme (WFP), the NATO Defence College, and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM).\n\n\nAccording to the GaWC study of world cities, Rome is a \"Beta +\" city.[145] The city was ranked in 2014 as 32nd in the Global Cities Index, the highest in Italy.[146] With a 2005 GDP of €94.376 billion (US$121.5 billion),[147][*needs update*] the city produces 6.7% of the national GDP (more than any other single city in Italy), and its unemployment rate, lowered from 11.1% to 6.5% between 2001 and 2005, is now one of the lowest rates of all the European Union capital cities.[147] Rome's economy grows at around 4.4% annually and continues to grow at a higher rate in comparison to any other city in the rest of the country.[147] This means that were Rome a country, it would be the world's 52nd richest country by GDP, near to the size to that of Egypt. Rome also had a 2003 GDP per capita of €29,153 (US$37,412), which was second in Italy (after Milan), and is more than 134.1% of the EU average GDP per capita.[148][*needs update*] Rome, on the whole, has the highest total earnings in Italy, reaching €47,076,890,463 in 2008,[149][*needs update*] yet, in terms of average workers' incomes, the city places itself 9th in Italy, with €24,509.[149] On a global level, Rome's workers receive the 30th highest wages in 2009, coming three places higher than in 2008, in which the city ranked 33rd.[150][*needs update*] The Rome area had a GDP amounting to $167.8 billion, and $38,765 per capita.[151]\n\n\nAlthough the economy of Rome is characterised by the absence of heavy industry, and it is largely dominated by services, high-technology companies (IT, aerospace, defence, telecommunications), research, construction and commercial activities (especially banking), and the huge development of tourism are very dynamic and extremely important to its economy. Rome's international airport, Fiumicino, is the largest in Italy, and the city hosts the head offices of the vast majority of the major Italian companies, as well as the headquarters of three of the world's 100 largest companies: Enel, Eni, and Telecom Italia.[152]\n\n\nUniversities, national radio and television and the movie industry in Rome are also important parts of the economy: Rome is also the hub of the Italian film industry, thanks to the Cinecittà studios, working since the 1930s. The city is also a centre for banking and insurance as well as electronics, energy, transport, and aerospace industries. Numerous international companies and agencies headquarters, government ministries, conference centres, sports venues, and museums are located in Rome's principal business districts: the Esposizione Universale Roma (EUR); the *Torrino* (further south from the EUR); the *Magliana*; the *Parco de' Medici-Laurentina* and the so-called *Tiburtina-valley* along the ancient Via Tiburtina.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tourism in Rome and List of tourist attractions in Rome\n\n![](image)Fontana della Barcaccia in Piazza di Spagna, the Spanish Steps and Trinità dei Monti\n![](image)Piazza Navona\n![](image)The Vatican Museums are the 8th most visited art museum in the world (2021).[153]\nRome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent \"villas\" (parks). Among the most significant resources are the many museums – Capitoline Museums, the Vatican Museums and the Galleria Borghese and others dedicated to modern and contemporary art – aqueducts, fountains, churches, palaces, historical buildings, the monuments and ruins of the Roman Forum, and the Catacombs. Rome is the third most visited city in the EU, after London and Paris, and receives an average of 7–10 million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years. The Colosseum (4 million tourists) and the Vatican Museums (4.2 million tourists) are the 39th and 37th (respectively) most visited places in the world, according to a recent study.[154]\n\n\nRome is a major archaeological hub, and one of the world's main centres of archaeological research. There are numerous cultural and research institutes located in the city, such as the American Academy in Rome,[155] and The Swedish Institute at Rome.[156] Rome contains numerous ancient sites, including the Forum Romanum, Trajan's Market, Trajan's Forum,[157] the Colosseum, and the Pantheon, to name but a few. The Colosseum, arguably one of Rome's most iconic archaeological sites, is regarded as a wonder of the world.[158][159]\n\n\nRome contains a vast collection of art, sculpture, fountains, mosaics, frescos, and paintings, from all different periods. Rome first became a major artistic centre during ancient Rome, with forms of important Roman art such as architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work. Metal-work, coin die and gem engraving, ivory carvings, figurine glass, pottery, and book illustrations are considered to be 'minor' forms of Roman artwork.[160] Rome later became a major centre of Renaissance art, since the popes spent vast sums of money for the constructions of grandiose basilicas, palaces, piazzas and public buildings in general. Rome became one of Europe's major centres of Renaissance artwork, second only to Florence, and able to compare to other major cities and cultural centres, such as Paris and Venice. The city was affected greatly by the baroque, and Rome became the home of numerous artists and architects, such as Bernini, Caravaggio, Carracci, Borromini and Cortona.[161] In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the city was one of the centres of the Grand Tour,[162] when wealthy, young English and other European aristocrats visited the city to learn about ancient Roman culture, art, philosophy, and architecture. Rome hosted a great number of neoclassical and rococo artists, such as Pannini and Bernardo Bellotto. Today, the city is a major artistic centre, with numerous art institutes[163] and museums.\n\n\nRome has a growing stock of contemporary and modern art and architecture. The National Gallery of Modern Art has works by Balla, Morandi, Pirandello, Carrà, De Chirico, De Pisis, Guttuso, Fontana, Burri, Mastroianni, Turcato, Kandisky, and Cézanne on permanent exhibition. 2010 saw the opening of Rome's newest arts foundation, a contemporary art and architecture gallery designed by acclaimed Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. Known as MAXXI – National Museum of the 21st Century Arts it restores a dilapidated area with striking modern architecture. Maxxi[164] features a campus dedicated to culture, experimental research laboratories, international exchange and study and research. It is one of Rome's most ambitious modern architecture projects alongside Renzo Piano's Auditorium Parco della Musica[165] and Massimiliano Fuksas' Rome Convention Center, Centro Congressi Italia EUR, in the EUR district, due to open in 2016.[166] The convention centre features a huge translucent container inside which is suspended a steel and teflon structure resembling a cloud and which contains meeting rooms and an auditorium with two piazzas open to the neighbourhood on either side.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sapienza University of Rome, founded in 1303\nRome is a nationwide and major international centre for higher education, containing numerous academies, colleges and universities. It boasts a large variety of academies and colleges, and has always been a major worldwide intellectual and educational centre, especially during Ancient Rome and the Renaissance, along with Florence.[167] According to the City Brands Index, Rome is considered the world's second most historically, educationally and culturally interesting and beautiful city.[168]\n\n\nRome has many universities and colleges. Its first university, La Sapienza (founded in 1303), is one of the largest in the world, with more than 140,000 students attending; in 2005 it ranked as Europe's 33rd best university[169] and in 2013 the Sapienza University of Rome ranked as the 62nd in the world and the top in Italy in its *World University Rankings*.[170] and has been ranked among Europe's 50 and the world's 150 best colleges.[171] In order to decrease the overcrowding of La Sapienza, two new public universities were founded during the last decades: Tor Vergata in 1982, and Roma Tre in 1992. Rome hosts also the LUISS School of Government,[172] Italy's most important graduate university in the areas of international affairs and European studies as well as LUISS Business School, Italy's most important business school. Rome ISIA was founded in 1973 by Giulio Carlo Argan and is Italy's oldest institution in the field of industrial design.\n\n\n\n![](image)Biblioteca Casanatense\nRome contains many pontifical universities and other institutes, including the British School at Rome, the French School in Rome, the Pontifical Gregorian University (the oldest Jesuit university in the world, founded in 1551), Istituto Europeo di Design, the Scuola Lorenzo de' Medici, the Link Campus of Malta, and the Università Campus Bio-Medico. Rome is also the location of two American Universities; The American University of Rome[173] and John Cabot University as well as St. John's University branch campus, John Felice Rome Center, a campus of Loyola University Chicago and Temple University Rome, a campus of Temple University.[174] The Roman Colleges are several seminaries for students from foreign countries studying for the priesthood at the Pontifical Universities.[175] Examples include the Venerable English College, the Pontifical North American College, the Scots College, and the Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome.\nRome's major libraries include: the Biblioteca Angelica, opened in 1604, making it Italy's first public library; the Biblioteca Vallicelliana, established in 1565; the Biblioteca Casanatense, opened in 1701; the National Central Library, one of the two national libraries in Italy, which contains 4,126,002 volumes; The Biblioteca del Ministero degli Affari Esteri, specialised in diplomacy, foreign affairs and modern history; the Biblioteca dell'Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana; the Biblioteca Don Bosco, one of the largest and most modern of all Salesian libraries; the Biblioteca e Museo teatrale del Burcardo, a museum-library specialised in history of drama and theatre; the Biblioteca della Società Geografica Italiana, which is based in the Villa Celimontana and is the most important geographical library in Italy, and one of Europe's most important;[176] and the Vatican Library, one of the oldest and most important libraries in the world, which was formally established in 1475, though in fact much older and has 75,000 codices, as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula. There are also many specialist libraries attached to various foreign cultural institutes in Rome, among them that of the American Academy in Rome, the French Academy in Rome and the Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute of Art History, a German library, often noted for excellence in the arts and sciences.[177]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture in Rome\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in EUR district\nThis section is an excerpt from Architecture of Rome.[edit]\nThe architecture of Rome over the centuries has greatly developed from Ancient Roman architecture to Italian modern and contemporary architecture. Rome was once the world's main epicentres of Classical architecture, developing new forms such as the arch, the dome and the vault. The Romanesque style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of Renaissance and Baroque architecture.[178] Rome's cityscape is also widely Neoclassical and Fascist in style.\n\n#### Fountains and aqueducts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of fountains in Rome and List of aqueducts in the city of Rome\n\n![](image)The Trevi Fountain. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of Nicola Salvi.\nRome is a city known for its numerous fountains, built-in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had fountains for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the piazzas of Rome. During the Roman Empire, in 98 AD, according to Sextus Julius Frontinus, the Roman consul who was named *curator aquarum* or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine aqueducts which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.[179]\n\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other degraded Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of Rubens, were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power\".[180]\n\n\n\n#### Statues[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Talking statues of Rome\n\n![](image)Fontana dei Fiumi by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1648\nRome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the talking statues of Rome. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the Pasquino and the Marforio, yet there are four other noted ones: il Babuino, Madama Lucrezia, il Facchino and Abbot Luigi. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents Menelaus, Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be Silenus, Marforio represents Oceanus, Madama Lucrezia is a bust of Isis, and il Facchino is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or graffiti expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to Giordano Bruno in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n\n\n#### Obelisks and columns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of obelisks in Rome\n\n![](image)Flaminio Obelisk, Piazza del Popolo\nThe city hosts eight ancient Egyptian and five ancient Roman obelisks, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an ancient Ethiopian obelisk in Rome.[181] The city contains some of obelisks in piazzas, such as in Piazza Navona, St Peter's Square, Piazza Montecitorio, and Piazza del Popolo, and others in villas, thermae parks and gardens, such as in Villa Celimontana, the Baths of Diocletian, and the Pincian Hill. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also Trajan's and Antonine Column, two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in Piazza Colonna and it was built around 180 AD by Commodus in memory of his parents. The Column of Marcus Aurelius was inspired by Trajan's Column at Trajan's Forum, which is part of the Imperial Fora.[182]\n\n\n\n#### Bridges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of bridges in Rome\n\n![](image)Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II at sunset\nThe city of Rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the Tiber. The only bridge to remain unaltered until today from the classical age is Ponte dei Quattro Capi, which connects the Isola Tiberina with the left bank. The other surviving – albeit modified – ancient Roman bridges crossing the Tiber are Ponte Cestio, Ponte Sant'Angelo and Ponte Milvio. Considering Ponte Nomentano, also built during ancient Rome, which crosses the Aniene, currently there are five ancient Roman bridges still remaining in the city.[183] Other noteworthy bridges are Ponte Sisto, the first bridge built in the Renaissance above Roman foundations; Ponte Rotto, actually the only remaining arch of the ancient *Pons Aemilius*, collapsed during the flood of 1598 and demolished at the end of the 19th century; and Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, a modern bridge connecting Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Borgo. Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the Ponte Sant'Angelo, which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by Bernini in 1688.[184]\n\n\n\n#### Catacombs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Catacombs of Rome\n\n![](image)The Vatican Caves, the place where many popes are buried\nRome has an extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include pagan and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through tuff, a soft volcanic rock, outside the boundaries of the city, because Roman law forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the Papacy which has invested in the Salesians of Don Bosco the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music in Rome and Events in Rome\n\n![](image)The Teatro dell'Opera di Roma at the Piazza Beniamino Gigli\nRome is an important centre for music, and it has an intense musical scene, including several prestigious music conservatories and theatres. It hosts the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia (founded in 1585), for which new concert halls have been built in the new Parco della Musica, one of the largest musical venues in the world. Rome also has an opera house, the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, as well as several minor musical institutions. The city also played host to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1991 and the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2004.\n\n\nRome has also had a major impact on music history. The Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.\n\n\nBetween 1960 and 1970 Rome was considered to be as a \"new Hollywood\" because of the many actors and directors who worked there; Via Vittorio Veneto had transformed into a glamour place where you could meet famous people.[185]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Via Condotti\nRome is also widely recognised as a world fashion capital. Although not as important as Milan, Rome is the fourth most important centre for fashion in the world, according to the 2009 Global Language Monitor after Milan, New York, and Paris, and beating London.[186]\n\n\nMajor luxury fashion houses and jewellery chains, such as Valentino, Bulgari, Fendi,[187] Laura Biagiotti, Brioni, and Renato Balestra, are headquartered or were founded in the city. Also, other major labels, such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, and Versace have luxury boutiques in Rome, primarily along its prestigious and upscale Via dei Condotti.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman cuisine\n\n![](image)*Spaghetti alla carbonara*, a typical Roman dish\nRome's cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes. Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the ancient age. Ancient Roman cuisine was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques.[188]\n\n\nLater, during the Renaissance, Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was Bartolomeo Scappi, who was a chef working for Pius IV; he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook *Opera dell'arte del cucinare* was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance cuisine and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a fork.[189]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Concia di zucchine*, an example of Roman-Jewish cuisine\nThe Testaccio, Rome's trade and slaughterhouse area, was often known as the \"belly\" or \"slaughterhouse\" of Rome, and was inhabited by butchers, or *vaccinari*.[190] The most common or ancient Roman cuisine included the \"fifth quarter\".[190] The old-fashioned *coda alla vaccinara* (oxtail cooked in the way of butchers)[190] is still one of the city's most popular meals and is part of most of Rome's restaurants' menus. Lamb is also a very popular part of Roman cuisine, and is often roasted with spices and herbs.[190]\n\n\nIn the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby Campagna, as lamb and vegetables (globe artichokes are common).[191] In parallel, Roman Jews – present in the city since the 1st century BC – developed their own cuisine, the *cucina giudaico-romanesca*.\n\n\nExamples of Roman dishes include *saltimbocca alla romana* – a veal cutlet, Roman-style, topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; *carciofi alla romana* – artichokes Roman-style, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; *carciofi alla giudia* – artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; *spaghetti alla carbonara* – spaghetti with bacon, eggs and pecorino; and *gnocchi di semolino alla romana* – semolina dumpling, Roman-style.[192]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of films set in Rome and List of films set in ancient Rome\n\n![](image)Entrance to the Cinecittà studios, the largest film studio in Europe[193]\nRome hosts the Cinecittà Studios,[194] the largest film and television production facility in continental Europe and the centre of the Italian cinema, where many of today's biggest box office hits are filmed. The 99-acre (40 ha) studio complex is 9.0 km (5.6 mi) from the centre of Rome and is part of one of the biggest production communities in the world, second only to Hollywood, with well over 5,000 professionals – from period costume makers to visual effects specialists. More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFounded in 1937 by Benito Mussolini, the studios were bombed by the Western Allies during the Second World War. In the 1950s, Cinecittà was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with Federico Fellini. Today, Cinecittà is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walkout\" with a completed film.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stadio Olimpico, home of A.S. Roma and S.S. Lazio, is one of the largest in Europe, with a capacity of over 70,000.[195]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Rome, as in the rest of the country.\nThe city hosted the final games of the 1934 and 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nThe latter took place in the Stadio Olimpico, which is also the shared home stadium for local Serie A clubs S.S. Lazio, founded in 1900, and A.S. Roma, founded in 1927, whose rivalry in the Derby della Capitale has become a staple of Roman sports culture.[196]\nFootballers who play for these teams and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been the case with players such as Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi (both for A.S. Roma), and Alessandro Nesta (for S.S. Lazio).\n\n\n\n![](image)Stadio dei Marmi\nRome hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics, with great success, using many ancient sites such as the Villa Borghese and the Thermae of Caracalla as venues. For the Olympic Games many new facilities were built, notably the new large Olympic Stadium (which was then enlarged and renewed to host several matches and the final of the 1990 FIFA World Cup), the Stadio Flaminio, the Villaggio Olimpico (Olympic Village, created to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district), ecc. Rome made a bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics but it was withdrawn.[197][198]\n\n\nFurther, Rome hosted the 1991 EuroBasket and is home to the internationally recognised basketball team Virtus Roma. Rugby union is gaining wider acceptance. Until 2011 the Stadio Flaminio was the home stadium for the Italy national rugby union team, which has been playing in the Six Nations Championship since 2000. The team now plays home games at the Stadio Olimpico because the Stadio Flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity and safety. Rome is home to local rugby union teams such as Rugby Roma (winner of five Italian championships), Unione Rugby Capitolina and S.S. Lazio 1927 (rugby union branch of the multisport club S.S. Lazio).\n\n\nEvery May, Rome hosts the ATP Masters Series tennis tournament on the clay courts of the Foro Italico. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the Giro d'Italia three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. Other local sports teams include volleyball (M. Roma Volley), handball or waterpolo.\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Rome\n\n![](image)Rome–Fiumicino Airport was the tenth busiest airport in Europe in 2016.\n![](image)Port of Civitavecchia\nRome is at the centre of the radial network of roads that roughly follow the lines of the ancient Roman roads which began at the Capitoline Hill and connected Rome with its empire. Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about 10 km (6 mi) from the Capitol, by the ring-road (the *Grande Raccordo Anulare* or *GRA*).\n\n\nDue to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is the principal railway node for central Italy. Rome's main railway station, Termini, is one of the largest railway stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day. The second-largest station in the city, Roma Tiburtina, has been redeveloped as a high-speed rail terminus.[199] As well as frequent high-speed day trains to all major Italian cities, Rome is linked nightly by 'boat train' sleeper services to Sicily, and internationally by overnight sleeper services to Munich and Vienna.\n\n\nRome is served by three airports. The intercontinental Leonardo da Vinci International Airport, Italy's chief airport is located in the nearby Fiumicino, south-west of Rome. The older Rome Ciampino Airport is a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as \"Ciampino Airport\", as it is located beside Ciampino, south-east of Rome. A third airport, the Roma-Urbe Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about 6 km (4 mi) north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights. The main airport system of the city (composed of Fiumicino and Ciampino), with 32.8 million passengers transported in 2022, is the second busiest airport system in Italy.[200]\n\n\nAlthough the city has its own quarter on the Mediterranean Sea (Lido di Ostia), this has only a marina and a small channel-harbour for fishing boats. The main harbour which serves Rome is Port of Civitavecchia, located about 62 km (39 mi) northwest of the city.[201]\n\n\nThe city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.[202] Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during daylight hours. Areas, where these restrictions apply, are known as Limited Traffic Zones (*Zona a Traffico Limitato* (ZTL)). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in Trastevere, Testaccio and San Lorenzo has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.\n\n\n\n![](image)Roma Metrorail and Underground map, 2016\n![](image)Conca d'Oro metro station\nA three-line metro system called the *Metropolitana* operates in Rome. Construction on the first branch started in the 1930s.[203] The line had been planned to quickly connect the main railway station with the newly planned E42 area in the southern suburbs, where 1942 the World Fair was supposed to be held. The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed Esposizione Universale Roma in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.\n\n\nThe A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999–2000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. The A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of €500 million. B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of 3.9 km (2 mi).\n\n\nA third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of €3 billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of 25.5 km (16 mi). It will partly replace the existing Termini-Pantano rail line. It will feature full automated, driverless trains.[204] The first section with 15 stations connecting Pantano with the quarter of Centocelle in the eastern part of the city, opened on 9 November 2014.[205] The end of the work was scheduled in 2015, but archaeological findings often delay underground construction work.\n\n\nA fourth line, D line, is also planned. It will have 22 stations over a distance of 20 km (12 mi). The first section was projected to open in 2015 and the final sections before 2035, but due to the city's financial crisis, the project has been put on hold.\n\n\nAbove-ground public transport in Rome is made up of a bus, tram and urban train network (FR lines). The bus network has in excess of 350 bus lines and over eight thousand bus stops, whereas the more-limited tram system has 39 km (24 mi) of track and 192 stops.[206] There are also trolleybuses.[207]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n* ![flag](image)EU portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Outline of Rome\n* SPQR\n* Tourism in Italy\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also the Vatican City\n2. **^** This hypothesis originates from the Roman Grammarian Maurus Servius Honoratus.

It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special *comune* named *Comune di Roma Capitale*. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi),[2] Rome is the country's most populated *comune* and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy.[3] Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy.[4] Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world)[5] is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the \"Eternal City\".[6] Rome is generally considered to be the \"cradle of Western civilization and Christian culture\", and the centre of the Catholic Church.[7][8][9]\n\n\nRome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe.[10] The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis.[11] It was first called *The Eternal City* (Latin: *Urbs Aeterna*; Italian: *La Città Eterna*) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy.[12][13] Rome is also called \"Caput Mundi\" (Capital of the World). \n\n\nAfter the fall of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world.[14] In this way, Rome first became one of the major centres of the Renaissance[15] and then became the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism. Famous artists, painters, sculptors, and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. In 1871, Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, which, in 1946, became the Italian Republic.\n\n\nIn 2019, Rome was the 14th most visited city in the world, with 8.6 million tourists, the third most visited city in the European Union, and the most popular tourist destination in Italy.[16] Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.[17] The host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean[18] (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many multinational companies, such as Eni, Enel, TIM, Leonardo, and banks such as BNL. Numerous companies are based within Rome's EUR business district, such as the luxury fashion house Fendi located in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. The presence of renowned international brands in the city has made Rome an important centre of fashion and design, and the Cinecittà Studios have been the set of many Academy Award–winning movies.[19]\n\n\n\n\n## Name and symbol[edit]\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Ancient Romans' founding myth,[20] the name *Roma* came from the city's founder and first king, Romulus.[1]\n\n\nHowever, it is possible that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself.[21] As early as the 4th century, there have been alternative theories proposed on the origin of the name *Roma*. Several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its linguistic roots which however remain uncertain:[22]\n\n\n\n* From *Rumon* or *Rumen*, archaic name of the Tiber, which in turn is supposedly related to the Greek verb ῥέω (*rhéō*) 'to flow, stream' and the Latin verb *ruō* 'to hurry, rush';[b]\n* From the Etruscan word 𐌓𐌖𐌌𐌀 (*ruma*), whose root is *\\*rum-* \"teat\", with possible reference either to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins Romulus and Remus, or to the shape of the Palatine and Aventine Hills;\n* From the Greek word ῥώμη (*rhṓmē*), which means *strength*.[c]\n\n\n### Other names and symbols[edit]\n\n\nRome has also been called in ancient times simply \"Urbs\" (central city),[23] from *urbs roma*, or identified with its ancient Roman symbol of SPQR, the symbol of its in Rome constituted republican government. Furthermore Rome has been called Urbs Aeterna (The Eternal City), Caput Mundi (The Capital of the world), Throne of St. Peter and Roma Capitale.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Rome\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Rome.\n\n### Earliest history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Founding of Rome\n\nHistorical States\n\n\n> \n> Roman Kingdom 753–509 BC  \n> \n> Roman Republic 509–27 BC  \n> \n> Roman Empire 27 BC– 395 AD  \n> \n> Western Roman Empire 286–476  \n> \n> Kingdom of Italy 476–493  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 493–536  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 536–546  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 546–547  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 547–549  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 549–552  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 552–751  \n> \n> Kingdom of the Lombards 751–756  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 756–1798  \n> \n> ![](image) Roman Republic 1798–1799  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1799–1809  \n> \n> ![](image) First French Empire 1809–1814  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1814–1849  \n> \n> ![](image) Roman Republic 1849  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1849–1870  \n> \n> ![](image) Kingdom of Italy 1870–1943  \n> \n> ![](image) Italian Social Republic 1943–1944  \n> \n> ![](image) Kingdom of Italy 1944–1946  \n> \n> ![](image) Italian Republic 1946–present  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nWhile there have been discoveries of archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from approximately 14,000 years ago, the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.[10] Evidence of stone tools, pottery, and stone weapons attest to about 10,000 years of human presence. Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum. Between the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age, each hill between the sea and the Capitoline Hill was topped by a village (on the Capitoline, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).[24] However, none of them yet had an urban quality.[24] Nowadays, there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation (\"synoecism\") of several villages around the largest one, placed above the Palatine.[24] This aggregation was facilitated by the increase of agricultural productivity above the subsistence level, which also allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities. These, in turn, boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly Ischia and Cumae).[24] These developments, which according to archaeological evidence took place during the mid-eighth century BC, can be considered as the \"birth\" of the city.[24] Despite recent excavations at the Palatine hill, the view that Rome was founded deliberately in the middle of the eighth century BC, as the legend of Romulus suggests, remains a fringe hypothesis.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Legend of the founding of Rome[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Romulus and Remus and Romulus\n\n![](image)*Capitoline Wolf*, a sculpture of the mythical she-wolf suckling the infant twins Romulus and Remus\nTraditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth. The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf.[20] They decided to build a city, but after an argument, Romulus killed his brother and the city took his name. According to the Roman annalists, this happened on 21 April 753 BC.[26] This legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.[27]\nThis was accomplished by the Roman poet Virgil in the first century BC. In addition, Strabo mentions an older story, that the city was an Arcadian colony founded by Evander. Strabo also writes that Lucius Coelius Antipater believed that Rome was founded by Greeks.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Monarchy and republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ancient Rome, Roman Kingdom, and Roman Republic\n\n![](image)The Temple of Portunus, god of grain storage, keys, livestock and ports.[30] Rome, built between 120 and 80 BC\n![](image)The Roman Forum are the remains of those buildings that during most of ancient Rome's time represented the political, legal, religious and economic centre of the city and the neuralgic centre of all the Roman civilisation.[31]\nAfter the foundation by Romulus according to a legend,[26] Rome was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system, initially with sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin, later by Etruscan kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus.[26]\n\n\nIn 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an oligarchic republic. Rome then began a period characterised by internal struggles between patricians (aristocrats) and plebeians (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, Volsci, Aequi, and Marsi.[32] After becoming master of Latium, Rome led several wars (against the Gauls, Osci-Samnites and the Greek colony of Taranto, allied with Pyrrhus, king of Epirus) whose result was the conquest of the Italian peninsula, from the central area up to Magna Graecia.[33]\n\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean and the Balkans, through the three Punic Wars (264–146 BC) fought against the city of Carthage and the three Macedonian Wars (212–168 BC) against Macedonia.[34] The first Roman provinces were established at this time: Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, Hispania, Macedonia, Achaea and Africa.[35]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the optimates, representing the conservative part of the Senate, and the populares, which relied on the help of the plebs (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city. The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army, which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic. Because of this, in the second half of the second century and during the first century BC there were conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus,[36] and the war against Jugurtha,[36] there was a civil war from which the general Sulla emerged victorious.[36] A major slave revolt under Spartacus followed,[37] and then the establishment of the first Triumvirate with Caesar, Pompey and Crassus.[37]\n\n\nThe conquest of Gaul made Caesar immensely powerful and popular, which led to a second civil war against the Senate and Pompey. After his victory, Caesar established himself as dictator for life.[37] His assassination led to a second Triumvirate among Octavian (Caesar's grandnephew and heir), Mark Antony and Lepidus, and to another civil war between Octavian and Antony.[38]\n\n\n\n### Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Empire\n\n![](image)The Ancient-Imperial-Roman palaces of the Palatine, a series of palaces located in the Palatine Hill, express power and wealth of emperors from Augustus until the 4th century.\n![](image)The Imperial fora belong to a series of *monumental fora* (public squares) constructed in Rome by the emperors. Also seen in the image is Trajan's Market.\n![](image)The Temple of Claudius to the south (left) of the Colosseum (model of Imperial Rome at the Museo della civiltà romana in Rome)\nIn 27 BC, Octavian became *princeps civitatis* and took the title of Augustus, founding the principate, a diarchy between the *princeps* and the senate.[38] During the reign of Nero, two thirds of the city was ruined after the Great Fire of Rome, and the persecution of Christians commenced.[39][40][41] Rome was established as a de facto empire, which reached its greatest expansion in the second century under the Emperor Trajan. Rome was confirmed as caput Mundi, i.e. the capital of the known world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period. During its first two centuries, the empire was ruled by emperors of the Julio-Claudian,[42] Flavian (who also built an eponymous amphitheatre, known as the Colosseum),[42] and Antonine dynasties.[43] This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion, preached by Jesus Christ in Judea in the first half of the first century (under Tiberius) and popularised by his apostles through the empire and beyond.[44] The Antonine age is considered the zenith of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the Atlantic Ocean to the Euphrates and from Britain to Egypt.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Colosseum at night\nAfter the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235, the Empire entered into a 50-year period known as the Crisis of the Third Century during which there were numerous putsches by generals, who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260 to 274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions – Britain, Spain, and North Africa – were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The Germanic tribes along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s–280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The Persian Empire invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.[45] Emperor Diocletian (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the Tetrarchy which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level: whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed price controls which did not last. He or Constantine regionalised the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Vérone et la province de Grande-Arménie, Mélanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in Nicomedia. In 296, he elevated Maximian to *Augustus* of the western half, where he ruled mostly from Mediolanum when not on the move.[45] In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in Trier and Galerius in Sirmium in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they, in turn, appointed two colleagues for themselves.[45]\n\n\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306–313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalising the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325–330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called Edict of Milan of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of Byzantium into his new residence, which, however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; Constantinople.[46]\n\n\nChristianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the Edict of Thessalonica issued in the name of three emperors – Gratian, Valentinian II, and Theodosius I – with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, Arcadius and Honorius divided the empire into a western and an eastern part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to Ravenna in 408, but from 450 the emperors mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Visigoths sacking Rome in 410, by Joseph-Noël Sylvestre (1890), the first time in c. 800 years that Rome had fallen to a foreign enemy\nRome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, was sacked in 410 by the Visigoths led by Alaric I,[48] but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as artwork in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450–500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by Genseric, king of the Vandals.[49] The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of Romulus Augustus on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the Middle Ages.[46]\n\n\nThe decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443, and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatised.[50]\n\n\nHowever, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. The population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, the population dropped to 30,000 but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.[51] The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.[52] The figure of 450,000–500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.[53] Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Fall of the Western Roman Empire\n\n![](image)The Vandals sacking Rome in 455, by Karl Briullov (1830s)\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome was first under the control of Odoacer and then became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom before returning to East Roman control after the Gothic War, which devastated the city in 546 and 550. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to 500,000 in 273[54] to 35,000 after the Gothic War (535–554),[55] reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens.[56] It is generally thought the population of the city until 300 AD was 1 million (estimates range from 2 million to 750,000) declining to 750–800,000 in 400 AD, 450–500,000 in 450 AD and down to 80–100,000 in 500 AD (though it may have been twice this).[57]\n\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the Pope, was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles Peter and Paul there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter, who is considered the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the Catholic Church.\n\n\nAfter the Lombard invasion of Italy (569–572), the city remained nominally Byzantine, but in reality, the popes pursued a policy of equilibrium between the Byzantines, the Franks, and the Lombards.[58] In 729, the Lombard king Liutprand donated the north Latium town of Sutri to the Church, starting its temporal power.[58] In 756, Pepin the Short, after having defeated the Lombards, gave the Pope temporal jurisdiction over the Roman Duchy and the Exarchate of Ravenna, thus creating the Papal States.[58] Since this period, three powers tried to rule the city: the pope, the nobility (together with the chiefs of militias, the judges, the Senate and the populace), and the Frankish king, as king of the Lombards, patricius, and Emperor.[58] These three parties (theocratic, republican, and imperial) were a characteristic of Roman life during the entire Middle Ages.[58] On Christmas night of 800, Charlemagne was crowned in Rome as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III: on that occasion, the city hosted for the first time the two powers whose struggle for control was to be a constant of the Middle Ages.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Detail view on an illustration by Raphael portraying the crowning of Charlemagne in Old Saint Peter's Basilica, on 25 December 800\nIn 846, Muslim Arabs unsuccessfully stormed the city's walls, but managed to loot St. Peter's and St. Paul's basilica, both outside the city wall.[59] After the decay of Carolingian power, Rome fell prey to feudal chaos: several noble families fought against the pope, the emperor, and each other. These were the times of Theodora and her daughter Marozia, concubines and mothers of several popes, and of Crescentius, a powerful feudal lord, who fought against the Emperors Otto II and Otto III.[60] The scandals of this period forced the papacy to reform itself: the election of the pope was reserved to the cardinals, and reform of the clergy was attempted. The driving force behind this renewal was the monk Ildebrando da Soana, who once elected pope under the name of Gregory VII became involved into the Investiture Controversy against Emperor Henry IV.[60] Subsequently, Rome was sacked and burned by the Normans under Robert Guiscard who had entered the city in support of the Pope, then besieged in Castel Sant'Angelo.[60]\n\n\nDuring this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a *senatore* or *patrizio*. In the 12th century, this administration, like other European cities, evolved into the commune, a new form of social organisation controlled by the new wealthy classes.[60] Pope Lucius II fought against the Roman commune, and the struggle was continued by his successor Pope Eugenius III: by this stage, the commune, allied with the aristocracy, was supported by Arnaldo da Brescia, a monk who was a religious and social reformer.[61] After the pope's death, Arnaldo was taken prisoner by Adrianus IV, which marked the end of the commune's autonomy.[61] Under Pope Innocent III, whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy, the commune liquidated the senate, and replaced it with a *Senatore*, who was subject to the pope.[61]\n\n\nIn this period, the papacy played a role of secular importance in Western Europe, often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs and exercising additional political powers.[62][63][64]\n\n\nIn 1266, Charles of Anjou, who was heading south to fight the Hohenstaufen on behalf of the pope, was appointed Senator. Charles founded the Sapienza, the university of Rome.[61] In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in Viterbo, could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the conclave.[61] In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: Annibaldi, Caetani, Colonna, Orsini, Conti, nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pope Gregory XI returned to Rome in 1376 and ended the Avignon Papacy.\nPope Boniface VIII, born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's universal domain; he proclaimed a crusade against the Colonna family and, in 1300, called for the first Jubilee of Christianity, which brought millions of pilgrims to Rome.[61] However, his hopes were crushed by the French king Philip the Fair, who took him prisoner and killed him in Anagni.[61] Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was briefly relocated to Avignon (1309–1377).[65] During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, Cola di Rienzo, came to power.[65] An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of *Tribuno*, his reforms were rejected by the populace.[65] Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal Albornoz, who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.[65] Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under Gregory XI.[65] The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the Western Schism (1377–1418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.[65]\n\n\n\n### Early modern history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Renaissance\n\n![](image)Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by Mario Cartaro (from 1575) shows the city's primary monuments.\n![](image)Castel Sant'Angelo, or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.\n![](image)Fontana della Barcaccia was created by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1629.\nIn 1418, the Council of Constance settled the Western Schism, and a Roman pope, Martin V, was elected.[65] This brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the Renaissance.[65] The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from Nicholas V, founder of the Vatican Library, to Pius II, humanist and literate, from Sixtus IV, a warrior pope, to Alexander VI, immoral and nepotist, from Julius II, soldier and patron, to Leo X, who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.[65]\n\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the Italian Renaissance moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new Saint Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and *Ponte Sisto* (the first bridge to be built across the Tiber since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the Popes engaged the best artists of the time, including Michelangelo, Perugino, Raphael, Ghirlandaio, Luca Signorelli, Botticelli, and Cosimo Rosselli.\n\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and engaging in nepotism and simony. The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the Reformation and, in turn, the Counter-Reformation. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\n\nThe Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the Pietà by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the Borgia Apartments. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under Pope Julius II (1503–1513) and his successors Leo X and Clement VII, both members of the Medici family.\n\n\n\n![](image)Carnival in Rome, c. 1650, by Johannes Lingelbach\n![](image)*A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome*, by Hendrik Frans van Lint, c. 1730\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world. The old St. Peter's Basilica built by Emperor Constantine the Great[66] (which by then was in a dilapidated state) was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists like Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli and Bramante, who built the temple of San Pietro in Montorio and planned a great project to renovate the Vatican. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the Villa Farnesina, the Raphael's Rooms, plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the Moses for the tomb of Julius II.\n\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including Agostino Chigi, who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The War of the League of Cognac caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since the previous sack; in 1527, the Landsknechts of Emperor Charles V sacked the city, bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.[65]\n\n\nBeginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.[65] Under the popes from Pius IV to Sixtus V, Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.[67] The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.[67]\n\n\nThis was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families (Barberini, Pamphili, Chigi, Rospigliosi, Altieri, Odescalchi) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.[67] During the Age of Enlightenment, new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.[65] But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the Jesuit order suppressed.[65]\n\n\n\n### Late modern and contemporary[edit]\n\n\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived Roman Republic (1798–1800), which was established under the influence of the French Revolution. The Papal States were restored in June 1800, but during Napoleon's reign Rome was annexed as a *Département* of the French Empire: first as *Département du Tibre* (1808–1810) and then as *Département Rome* (1810–1814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the Congress of Vienna of 1814.\n\n\nIn 1849, a second Roman Republic was proclaimed during a year of revolutions in 1848. Two of the most influential figures of the Italian unification, Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi, fought for the short-lived republic.\n\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 with the temporary capital in Florence. That year Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of Napoleon III. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. In 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. Italian troops were able to capture Rome entering the city through a breach near Porta Pia. Pope Pius IX declared himself a prisoner in the Vatican. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.[68] In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bombardment of Rome by Allied planes, 1943\nSoon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of Italian Fascism led by Benito Mussolini, who led a march on the city. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new Italian Empire and allying Italy with Nazi Germany in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city centre in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.[69] The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943, the San Lorenzo district was subject to Allied bombing raids, resulting in about 3,000 fatalities and 11,000 injuries, of whom another 1,500 died.[70] Mussolini was arrested on 25 July 1943. On the date of the Italian Armistice 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an open city. It was liberated on 4 June 1944.\n\n\nRome developed greatly after the war as part of the \"Italian economic miracle\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of *la dolce vita* (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as *Ben Hur*, *Quo Vadis*, *Roman Holiday* and *La Dolce Vita* filmed in the city's iconic Cinecittà Studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s when the *comune* had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Rome\nRome is in the Lazio region of central Italy on the Tiber (Italian: *Tevere*) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the Tiber Island, the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the Aventine Hill, the Caelian Hill, the Capitoline Hill, the Esquiline Hill, the Palatine Hill, the Quirinal Hill, and the Viminal Hill. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the Aniene, which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\n\nAlthough the city centre is about 24 km (15 mi) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea, the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of Ostia is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from 13 m (43 ft) above sea level (at the base of the Pantheon) to 139 m (456 ft) above sea level (the peak of Monte Mario).[71] The *Comune* of Rome covers an overall area of about 1,285 km2 (496 sq mi), including many green areas.\n\n\n\n### Parks and gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of parks and gardens in Rome\n\n![](image)The Temple of Aesculapius, in the Villa Borghese gardens\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.[72] The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are the Villa Borghese, Villa Ada, and Villa Doria Pamphili. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill, comprising some 1.8 km2 (0.7 sq mi). The Villa Sciarra is on the hill, with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere, the Orto Botanico (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush Villa Celimontana, close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of Pincio and Villa Medici. There is also a notable pine wood at Castelfusano, near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin, including the Pineto Regional Park and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Rome\n\n![](image)Stone pines in the Villa Doria Pamphili\nRome has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: *Csa*),[73] with hot, dry summers and mild, humid winters.\n\n\nIts average annual temperature is above 21 °C (70 °F) during the day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. In the coldest month, January, the average temperature is 12.6 °C (54.7 °F) during the day and 2.1 °C (35.8 °F) at night. In the warmest month, August, the average temperature is 31.7 °C (89.1 °F) during the day and 17.3 °C (63.1 °F) at night.\n\n\nDecember, January and February are the coldest months, with a daily mean temperature of approximately 8 °C (46 °F). Temperatures during these months generally vary between 10 and 15 °C (50 and 59 °F) during the day and between 3 and 5 °C (37 and 41 °F) at night, with colder or warmer spells occurring frequently. Snowfall is rare but not unheard of, with light snow or flurries occurring on some winters, generally without accumulation, and major snowfalls on a very rare occurrence (the most recent ones were in 2018, 2012 and 1986).[74][75][76]\n\n\nThe average relative humidity is 75%, varying from 72% in July to 77% in November. Sea temperatures vary from a low of 13.9 °C (57.0 °F) in February to a high of 25.0 °C (77.0 °F) in August.[77]\n\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Rome was 42.9 °C (109.2 °F) on 18 July 2023.[78]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Rome Ciampino Airport, elevation: 129 m or 423 ft, 1991-2020 normals, extremes 1944–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 39.7(103.5)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 40.0(104.0)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 12.7(54.9)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −2.4(27.7)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 4.3(39.7)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | −5.2(22.6)\n | −6.6(20.1)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 65.6(2.58)\n | 62.8(2.47)\n | 58.6(2.31)\n | 68.6(2.70)\n | 56.9(2.24)\n | 30.1(1.19)\n | 19.8(0.78)\n | 30.2(1.19)\n | 64.9(2.56)\n | 88.1(3.47)\n | 108.2(4.26)\n | 98.3(3.87)\n | 752.0(29.61)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 7.40\n | 7.48\n | 6.85\n | 7.42\n | 5.54\n | 3.38\n | 2.16\n | 2.20\n | 6.00\n | 7.32\n | 8.84\n | 9.44\n | 74.03\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 75.8\n | 71.5\n | 70.6\n | 70.4\n | 69.0\n | 65.4\n | 63.3\n | 64.1\n | 69.1\n | 74.0\n | 77.9\n | 77.2\n | 70.7\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 155.9\n | 171.9\n | 203.1\n | 221.1\n | 276.5\n | 298.8\n | 337.6\n | 320.2\n | 237.9\n | 200.6\n | 153.3\n | 146.9\n | 2,723.9\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA[79] |\n| Source 2: Temperature estreme in Toscana[80] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Demographics of Italy\n\n![](image)Rome (comune) age-sex pyramid in 2022\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1861  | 194,500 | —     |\n| 1871  | 212,432 | +9.2% |\n| 1881  | 273,952 | +29.0% |\n| 1901  | 422,411 | +54.2% |\n| 1911  | 518,917 | +22.8% |\n| 1921  | 660,235 | +27.2% |\n| 1931  | 930,926 | +41.0% |\n| 1936  | 1,150,589 | +23.6% |\n| 1951  | 1,651,754 | +43.6% |\n| 1961  | 2,188,160 | +32.5% |\n| 1971  | 2,781,993 | +27.1% |\n| 1981  | 2,840,259 | +2.1% |\n| 1991  | 2,775,250 | −2.3% |\n| 2001  | 2,663,182 | −4.0% |\n| 2011  | 2,617,175 | −1.7% |\n| 2021  | 2,770,226 | +5.8% |\n| Source: ISTAT, 2022 |\n\n\nIn 550 BC, Rome was the second largest city in Italy, with Tarentum being the largest.[*citation needed*] It had an area of about 285 ha (700 acres) and an estimated population of 35,000. Other sources suggest the population was just under 100,000 from 600 to 500 BC.[81][82] When the Republic was founded in 509 BC the census recorded a population of 130,000.[83] The republic included the city itself and the immediate surroundings. Other sources suggest a population of 150,000 in 500 BC. It surpassed 300,000 in 150 BC.[84][85][86][87][88]\n\n\nThe size of the city at the time of the Emperor Augustus is a matter of speculation, with estimates based on grain distribution, grain imports, aqueduct capacity, city limits, population density, census reports, and assumptions about the number of unreported women, children and slaves providing a very wide range. Glenn Storey estimates 450,000 people, Whitney Oates estimates 1.2 million, Neville Morely provides a rough estimate of 800,000 and excludes earlier suggestions of 2 million.[89][90][91][92] Estimates of the city's population towards and after the end of the Roman empire also vary. A.H.M. Jones estimated the population at 650,000 in the mid-fifth century. The damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated. The population had already started to decline from the late fourth century onward, although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire.[93] According to Krautheimer it was still close to 800,000 in 400 AD; had declined to 500,000 by 452, and dwindled to perhaps 100,000 in 500 AD. After the Gothic Wars, 535–552, the population may have dwindled temporarily to 30,000. During the pontificate of Pope Gregory I (590–604), it may have reached 90,000, augmented by refugees.[94] Lancon estimates 500,000 based on the number of 'incisi' enrolled as eligible to receive bread, oil and wine rations; the number fell to 120,000 in the reform of 419.[95] Neil Christie, citing free rations for the poorest, estimated 500,000 in the mid-fifth century and still a quarter of a million at the end of the century.[96] Novel 36 of Emperor Valentinian III records 3.629 million pounds of pork to be distributed to the needy at 5 lbs. per month for the five winter months, sufficient for 145,000 recipients. This has been used to suggest a population of just under 500,000. Supplies of grain remained steady until the seizure of the remaining provinces of North Africa in 439 by the Vandals, and may have continued to some degree afterwards for a while. The city's population declined to less than 50,000 people in the Early Middle Ages from 700 AD onward. It continued to stagnate or shrink until the Renaissance.[97]\n\n\nWhen the Kingdom of Italy annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 225,000. Less than half the city within the walls was built up in 1881 when the population recorded was 275,000. This increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I. The Fascist regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.[*citation needed*][*clarification needed*] Population growth continued after the Second World War, helped by a post-war economic boom. A construction boom also created many suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nIn mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2 million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800 inhabitants/km2 stretching over more than 5,000 km2 (1,900 sq mi)). Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00% of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56%.[98] The current[*when?*] birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe urban area of Rome extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 3.9 million.[99] Between 3.2 and 4.2 million people live in the Rome metropolitan area.[100][101][102][103][104]\n\n\n\n### Origin groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Esquilino *rione*\nAccording to the latest statistics conducted by ISTAT,[105] approximately 9.5% of the population consists of non-Italians. About half of the immigrant population consists of those of various other European origins (chiefly Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Albanian) numbering a combined total of 131,118 or 4.7% of the population. The remaining 4.8% are those with non-European origins, chiefly Filipinos (26,933), Bangladeshis (12,154), and Chinese (10,283).\n\n\nThe Esquilino *rione*, off Termini Railway Station, has evolved into a largely immigrant neighbourhood. It is perceived as Rome's Chinatown. Immigrants from more than a hundred different countries reside there. A commercial district, Esquilino contains restaurants featuring many kinds of international cuisine. There are wholesale clothes shops. Of the 1,300 or so commercial premises operating in the district 800 are Chinese-owned; around 300 are run by immigrants from other countries around the world; 200 are owned by Italians.[106]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Roman dialect and Latin\n\n![](image)Advertisement in Romanesco dialect at a subway station in Rome\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive, however. Through the process of Romanization, the peoples of Italy, Gallia, the Iberian Peninsula and Dacia developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonisation and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the Norman Conquest, borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The Roman or Latin alphabet is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.[107]\n\n\nThe medieval Roman dialect belonged to the southern family of Italian dialects, and was thus much closer to the Neapolitan language than to the Florentine.[108][109] A typical example of Romanesco of that period is *Vita di Cola di Rienzo [it]* (\"Life of Cola di Rienzo\"), written by an anonymous Roman during the 14th century.[108] Starting with the 16th century, the Roman dialect underwent a stronger and stronger influence from the Tuscan dialect (from which modern Italian derives) starting with the reigns of the two Medici popes (Leo X and Clement VII) and with the Sack of Rome in 1527, two events which provoked a large immigration from Tuscany.[110][111] Therefore, current Romanesco has grammar and roots that are rather different from other dialects in Central Italy.[111]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Rome\n\nSee also: Vatican City\n\n![](image)Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, Rome's Cathedral, built in 324, and partly rebuilt between 1660 and 1734\n![](image)Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome and the largest Catholic Marian church in Rome\nMuch like the rest of Italy, Rome is predominantly Christian, and the city has been an important centre of religion and pilgrimage for centuries, the base of the ancient Roman religion with the pontifex maximus and later the seat of the Vatican and the pope. Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the Religio Romana (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were Jupiter, the Most High, and Mars, the god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, Romulus and Remus, according to tradition. Other deities such as Vesta and Minerva were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as Mithraism. Later, after St Peter and St Paul were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the Old St. Peter's Basilica was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the Avignon papacy), Rome has for centuries been the home of the Roman Catholic Church and the Bishop of Rome, otherwise known as the Pope.\n\n\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the Vatican City and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, the Basilica di San Clemente, San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane and the Church of the Gesù. There are also the ancient Catacombs of Rome underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the Pontifical Lateran University, Pontifical Biblical Institute, Pontifical Gregorian University, and Pontifical Oriental Institute.\n\n\nSince the end of the Roman Republic, Rome is also the centre of an important Jewish community,[112] which was once based in Trastevere, and later in the Roman Ghetto. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the *Tempio Maggiore*.\n\n\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the *Mons Vaticanus* (Vatican Hill), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman rione of Borgo until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the Tiber, the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV, later expanded by the current fortification walls of Paul III, Pius IV, and Urban VIII. When the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. \n\n\nRome has been a major Christian pilgrimage site since the Middle Ages. People from all over the Christian world visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The city became a major pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the Middle Ages, Rome kept its status as Papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the Papacy briefly relocated to Avignon (1309–1377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter. Pilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the Pilate's stairs: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the praetorium of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem, which Jesus Christ stood on during his Passion on his way to trial.[113]\n\n\n\n![Panorama of St. Peter's Square](image)\nSt. Peter's Square in Vatican City\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mayor of Rome, City Council of Rome, Elections in Rome, and Administrative subdivisions of Rome\n\n![](image)Current seat of the Mayor of Rome, *Palazzo Senatorio* on Capitoline Hill.\n![](image)The Palazzo del Quirinale, now seat of the President of the Italian Republic\nRome constitutes a comune *speciale*, named *\"Roma Capitale\"*,[114] and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 *comuni* of Italy. It is governed by a mayor and a city council. The seat of the *comune* is the *Palazzo Senatorio* on the Capitoline Hill, the historic seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as *\"Campidoglio\"*, the Italian name of the hill.\n\n\nSince 1972, the city has been divided into administrative areas, called *municipi* (sing. *municipio*) (until 2001 named *circoscrizioni*).[115] They were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation in the city. Each *municipio* is governed by a president and a council of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years. The *municipi* frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city. The municipi were originally 20, then 19,[116] and in 2013, their number was reduced to 15.[117]\n\n\nRome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 *rioni*, all of which are located within the Aurelian Walls except Prati and Borgo. These originate from the 14 regions of Augustan Rome, which evolved in the Middle Ages into the medieval rioni.[118] In the Renaissance, under Pope Sixtus V, they again reached fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under Pope Benedict XIV in 1743.\n\n\nRome is the principal town of the Metropolitan City of Rome, operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old provincia di Roma, which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until Civitavecchia. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At 5,352 km2 (2,066 sq mi), its dimensions are comparable to the region of Liguria. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the Lazio region.[119]\n\n\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the Italian Government. The official residences of the President of the Italian Republic and the Italian Prime Minister, the seats of both houses of the Italian Parliament and that of the Italian Constitutional Court are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in Palazzo della Farnesina near the Olympic stadium.\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)FAO headquarters in Rome, Circo Massimo\nAmong the global cities, Rome is unique in having two sovereign entities located entirely within its city limits, the Holy See, represented by the Vatican City State, and the territorially smaller Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian capital city and a sovereign possession of the Holy See, which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the Roman Catholic Church. For this reason, Rome has sometimes been described as the capital of two states.[120][121] Rome is the seat of the so-called \"Polo Romano\" made up by three main international agencies of the United Nations: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).[122]\n\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The Treaties of the EU are located in Palazzo della Farnesina. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (predecessor to the European Union), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed European Constitution in July 2004. Rome is the seat of the European Olympic Committee and of the NATO Defense College. The city is the place where the Statute of the International Criminal Court and the European Convention on Human Rights were formulated. The city hosts also other important international entities such as the IDLO (International Development Law Organisation), the ICCROM (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the UNIDROIT (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n\n\n#### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Italy\n\nSince 9 April 1956, Rome is exclusively and reciprocally twinned only with:\n\n\n\n* ![France](image) Paris, France, 1956\n\n\n*Solo Parigi è degna di Roma; solo Roma è degna di Parigi.* (in Italian)\n*Seule Paris est digne de Rome; seule Rome est digne de Paris.* (in French)\n\"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris.\"[123][124][125][126][127]\nRome's other partner cities are:[128]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Achacachi, Bolivia[128]\n* ![](image) Algiers, Algeria[128]\n* ![](image) Beijing, China[129][130]\n* ![](image) Belgrade, Serbia[128]\n* ![](image) Brasília, Brazil[128]\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina[128]\n* ![](image) Cairo, Egypt[128]\n* ![](image) Cincinnati, United States[128]\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine[128]\n* ![](image) Kobanî, Syria[131]\n* ![](image) Kraków, Poland[132]\n* ![](image) Madrid, Spain[133]\n* ![](image) Multan, Pakistan[134]\n* ![](image) New Delhi, India[128]\n* ![](image) New York City, United States[135]\n* ![](image) Plovdiv, Bulgaria[128]\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea[136][137]\n* ![](image) Sydney, Australia[128]\n* ![](image) Tirana, Albania[138][139]\n* ![](image) Tehran, Iran[128]\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan[140]\n* ![](image) Tongeren, Belgium[128]\n* ![](image) Tunis, Tunisia[141]\n* ![](image) Washington, D.C., United States[142]\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Rome\n\n![](image)Palazzo Eni, in the EUR business district, headquarters of Eni, considered one of the world's oil and gas \"supermajors\".[143]\n![](image)Enel's headquarters in Rome, the second largest power company in the world by revenue after the State Grid Corporation of China.[144]\n![](image)Orizzonte Europa, BNL headquarters in Rome\nAs the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single *Ministeri*), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City. Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones, such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, and the German Archaeological Institute. There are also specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Rome also hosts major international and worldwide political and cultural organisations, such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Food Programme (WFP), the NATO Defence College, and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM).\n\n\nAccording to the GaWC study of world cities, Rome is a \"Beta +\" city.[145] The city was ranked in 2014 as 32nd in the Global Cities Index, the highest in Italy.[146] With a 2005 GDP of €94.376 billion (US$121.5 billion),[147][*needs update*] the city produces 6.7% of the national GDP (more than any other single city in Italy), and its unemployment rate, lowered from 11.1% to 6.5% between 2001 and 2005, is now one of the lowest rates of all the European Union capital cities.[147] Rome's economy grows at around 4.4% annually and continues to grow at a higher rate in comparison to any other city in the rest of the country.[147] This means that were Rome a country, it would be the world's 52nd richest country by GDP, near to the size to that of Egypt. Rome also had a 2003 GDP per capita of €29,153 (US$37,412), which was second in Italy (after Milan), and is more than 134.1% of the EU average GDP per capita.[148][*needs update*] Rome, on the whole, has the highest total earnings in Italy, reaching €47,076,890,463 in 2008,[149][*needs update*] yet, in terms of average workers' incomes, the city places itself 9th in Italy, with €24,509.[149] On a global level, Rome's workers receive the 30th highest wages in 2009, coming three places higher than in 2008, in which the city ranked 33rd.[150][*needs update*] The Rome area had a GDP amounting to $167.8 billion, and $38,765 per capita.[151]\n\n\nAlthough the economy of Rome is characterised by the absence of heavy industry, and it is largely dominated by services, high-technology companies (IT, aerospace, defence, telecommunications), research, construction and commercial activities (especially banking), and the huge development of tourism are very dynamic and extremely important to its economy. Rome's international airport, Fiumicino, is the largest in Italy, and the city hosts the head offices of the vast majority of the major Italian companies, as well as the headquarters of three of the world's 100 largest companies: Enel, Eni, and Telecom Italia.[152]\n\n\nUniversities, national radio and television and the movie industry in Rome are also important parts of the economy: Rome is also the hub of the Italian film industry, thanks to the Cinecittà studios, working since the 1930s. The city is also a centre for banking and insurance as well as electronics, energy, transport, and aerospace industries. Numerous international companies and agencies headquarters, government ministries, conference centres, sports venues, and museums are located in Rome's principal business districts: the Esposizione Universale Roma (EUR); the *Torrino* (further south from the EUR); the *Magliana*; the *Parco de' Medici-Laurentina* and the so-called *Tiburtina-valley* along the ancient Via Tiburtina.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tourism in Rome and List of tourist attractions in Rome\n\n![](image)Fontana della Barcaccia in Piazza di Spagna, the Spanish Steps and Trinità dei Monti\n![](image)Piazza Navona\n![](image)The Vatican Museums are the 8th most visited art museum in the world (2021).[153]\nRome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent \"villas\" (parks). Among the most significant resources are the many museums – Capitoline Museums, the Vatican Museums and the Galleria Borghese and others dedicated to modern and contemporary art – aqueducts, fountains, churches, palaces, historical buildings, the monuments and ruins of the Roman Forum, and the Catacombs. Rome is the third most visited city in the EU, after London and Paris, and receives an average of 7–10 million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years. The Colosseum (4 million tourists) and the Vatican Museums (4.2 million tourists) are the 39th and 37th (respectively) most visited places in the world, according to a recent study.[154]\n\n\nRome is a major archaeological hub, and one of the world's main centres of archaeological research. There are numerous cultural and research institutes located in the city, such as the American Academy in Rome,[155] and The Swedish Institute at Rome.[156] Rome contains numerous ancient sites, including the Forum Romanum, Trajan's Market, Trajan's Forum,[157] the Colosseum, and the Pantheon, to name but a few. The Colosseum, arguably one of Rome's most iconic archaeological sites, is regarded as a wonder of the world.[158][159]\n\n\nRome contains a vast collection of art, sculpture, fountains, mosaics, frescos, and paintings, from all different periods. Rome first became a major artistic centre during ancient Rome, with forms of important Roman art such as architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work. Metal-work, coin die and gem engraving, ivory carvings, figurine glass, pottery, and book illustrations are considered to be 'minor' forms of Roman artwork.[160] Rome later became a major centre of Renaissance art, since the popes spent vast sums of money for the constructions of grandiose basilicas, palaces, piazzas and public buildings in general. Rome became one of Europe's major centres of Renaissance artwork, second only to Florence, and able to compare to other major cities and cultural centres, such as Paris and Venice. The city was affected greatly by the baroque, and Rome became the home of numerous artists and architects, such as Bernini, Caravaggio, Carracci, Borromini and Cortona.[161] In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the city was one of the centres of the Grand Tour,[162] when wealthy, young English and other European aristocrats visited the city to learn about ancient Roman culture, art, philosophy, and architecture. Rome hosted a great number of neoclassical and rococo artists, such as Pannini and Bernardo Bellotto. Today, the city is a major artistic centre, with numerous art institutes[163] and museums.\n\n\nRome has a growing stock of contemporary and modern art and architecture. The National Gallery of Modern Art has works by Balla, Morandi, Pirandello, Carrà, De Chirico, De Pisis, Guttuso, Fontana, Burri, Mastroianni, Turcato, Kandisky, and Cézanne on permanent exhibition. 2010 saw the opening of Rome's newest arts foundation, a contemporary art and architecture gallery designed by acclaimed Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. Known as MAXXI – National Museum of the 21st Century Arts it restores a dilapidated area with striking modern architecture. Maxxi[164] features a campus dedicated to culture, experimental research laboratories, international exchange and study and research. It is one of Rome's most ambitious modern architecture projects alongside Renzo Piano's Auditorium Parco della Musica[165] and Massimiliano Fuksas' Rome Convention Center, Centro Congressi Italia EUR, in the EUR district, due to open in 2016.[166] The convention centre features a huge translucent container inside which is suspended a steel and teflon structure resembling a cloud and which contains meeting rooms and an auditorium with two piazzas open to the neighbourhood on either side.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sapienza University of Rome, founded in 1303\nRome is a nationwide and major international centre for higher education, containing numerous academies, colleges and universities. It boasts a large variety of academies and colleges, and has always been a major worldwide intellectual and educational centre, especially during Ancient Rome and the Renaissance, along with Florence.[167] According to the City Brands Index, Rome is considered the world's second most historically, educationally and culturally interesting and beautiful city.[168]\n\n\nRome has many universities and colleges. Its first university, La Sapienza (founded in 1303), is one of the largest in the world, with more than 140,000 students attending; in 2005 it ranked as Europe's 33rd best university[169] and in 2013 the Sapienza University of Rome ranked as the 62nd in the world and the top in Italy in its *World University Rankings*.[170] and has been ranked among Europe's 50 and the world's 150 best colleges.[171] In order to decrease the overcrowding of La Sapienza, two new public universities were founded during the last decades: Tor Vergata in 1982, and Roma Tre in 1992. Rome hosts also the LUISS School of Government,[172] Italy's most important graduate university in the areas of international affairs and European studies as well as LUISS Business School, Italy's most important business school. Rome ISIA was founded in 1973 by Giulio Carlo Argan and is Italy's oldest institution in the field of industrial design.\n\n\n\n![](image)Biblioteca Casanatense\nRome contains many pontifical universities and other institutes, including the British School at Rome, the French School in Rome, the Pontifical Gregorian University (the oldest Jesuit university in the world, founded in 1551), Istituto Europeo di Design, the Scuola Lorenzo de' Medici, the Link Campus of Malta, and the Università Campus Bio-Medico. Rome is also the location of two American Universities; The American University of Rome[173] and John Cabot University as well as St. John's University branch campus, John Felice Rome Center, a campus of Loyola University Chicago and Temple University Rome, a campus of Temple University.[174] The Roman Colleges are several seminaries for students from foreign countries studying for the priesthood at the Pontifical Universities.[175] Examples include the Venerable English College, the Pontifical North American College, the Scots College, and the Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome.\nRome's major libraries include: the Biblioteca Angelica, opened in 1604, making it Italy's first public library; the Biblioteca Vallicelliana, established in 1565; the Biblioteca Casanatense, opened in 1701; the National Central Library, one of the two national libraries in Italy, which contains 4,126,002 volumes; The Biblioteca del Ministero degli Affari Esteri, specialised in diplomacy, foreign affairs and modern history; the Biblioteca dell'Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana; the Biblioteca Don Bosco, one of the largest and most modern of all Salesian libraries; the Biblioteca e Museo teatrale del Burcardo, a museum-library specialised in history of drama and theatre; the Biblioteca della Società Geografica Italiana, which is based in the Villa Celimontana and is the most important geographical library in Italy, and one of Europe's most important;[176] and the Vatican Library, one of the oldest and most important libraries in the world, which was formally established in 1475, though in fact much older and has 75,000 codices, as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula. There are also many specialist libraries attached to various foreign cultural institutes in Rome, among them that of the American Academy in Rome, the French Academy in Rome and the Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute of Art History, a German library, often noted for excellence in the arts and sciences.[177]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture in Rome\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in EUR district\nThis section is an excerpt from Architecture of Rome.[edit]\nThe architecture of Rome over the centuries has greatly developed from Ancient Roman architecture to Italian modern and contemporary architecture. Rome was once the world's main epicentres of Classical architecture, developing new forms such as the arch, the dome and the vault. The Romanesque style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of Renaissance and Baroque architecture.[178] Rome's cityscape is also widely Neoclassical and Fascist in style.\n\n#### Fountains and aqueducts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of fountains in Rome and List of aqueducts in the city of Rome\n\n![](image)The Trevi Fountain. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of Nicola Salvi.\nRome is a city known for its numerous fountains, built-in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had fountains for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the piazzas of Rome. During the Roman Empire, in 98 AD, according to Sextus Julius Frontinus, the Roman consul who was named *curator aquarum* or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine aqueducts which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.[179]\n\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other degraded Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of Rubens, were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power\".[180]\n\n\n\n#### Statues[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Talking statues of Rome\n\n![](image)Fontana dei Fiumi by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1648\nRome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the talking statues of Rome. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the Pasquino and the Marforio, yet there are four other noted ones: il Babuino, Madama Lucrezia, il Facchino and Abbot Luigi. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents Menelaus, Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be Silenus, Marforio represents Oceanus, Madama Lucrezia is a bust of Isis, and il Facchino is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or graffiti expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to Giordano Bruno in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n\n\n#### Obelisks and columns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of obelisks in Rome\n\n![](image)Flaminio Obelisk, Piazza del Popolo\nThe city hosts eight ancient Egyptian and five ancient Roman obelisks, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an ancient Ethiopian obelisk in Rome.[181] The city contains some of obelisks in piazzas, such as in Piazza Navona, St Peter's Square, Piazza Montecitorio, and Piazza del Popolo, and others in villas, thermae parks and gardens, such as in Villa Celimontana, the Baths of Diocletian, and the Pincian Hill. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also Trajan's and Antonine Column, two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in Piazza Colonna and it was built around 180 AD by Commodus in memory of his parents. The Column of Marcus Aurelius was inspired by Trajan's Column at Trajan's Forum, which is part of the Imperial Fora.[182]\n\n\n\n#### Bridges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of bridges in Rome\n\n![](image)Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II at sunset\nThe city of Rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the Tiber. The only bridge to remain unaltered until today from the classical age is Ponte dei Quattro Capi, which connects the Isola Tiberina with the left bank. The other surviving – albeit modified – ancient Roman bridges crossing the Tiber are Ponte Cestio, Ponte Sant'Angelo and Ponte Milvio. Considering Ponte Nomentano, also built during ancient Rome, which crosses the Aniene, currently there are five ancient Roman bridges still remaining in the city.[183] Other noteworthy bridges are Ponte Sisto, the first bridge built in the Renaissance above Roman foundations; Ponte Rotto, actually the only remaining arch of the ancient *Pons Aemilius*, collapsed during the flood of 1598 and demolished at the end of the 19th century; and Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, a modern bridge connecting Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Borgo. Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the Ponte Sant'Angelo, which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by Bernini in 1688.[184]\n\n\n\n#### Catacombs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Catacombs of Rome\n\n![](image)The Vatican Caves, the place where many popes are buried\nRome has an extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include pagan and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through tuff, a soft volcanic rock, outside the boundaries of the city, because Roman law forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the Papacy which has invested in the Salesians of Don Bosco the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music in Rome and Events in Rome\n\n![](image)The Teatro dell'Opera di Roma at the Piazza Beniamino Gigli\nRome is an important centre for music, and it has an intense musical scene, including several prestigious music conservatories and theatres. It hosts the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia (founded in 1585), for which new concert halls have been built in the new Parco della Musica, one of the largest musical venues in the world. Rome also has an opera house, the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, as well as several minor musical institutions. The city also played host to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1991 and the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2004.\n\n\nRome has also had a major impact on music history. The Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.\n\n\nBetween 1960 and 1970 Rome was considered to be as a \"new Hollywood\" because of the many actors and directors who worked there; Via Vittorio Veneto had transformed into a glamour place where you could meet famous people.[185]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Via Condotti\nRome is also widely recognised as a world fashion capital. Although not as important as Milan, Rome is the fourth most important centre for fashion in the world, according to the 2009 Global Language Monitor after Milan, New York, and Paris, and beating London.[186]\n\n\nMajor luxury fashion houses and jewellery chains, such as Valentino, Bulgari, Fendi,[187] Laura Biagiotti, Brioni, and Renato Balestra, are headquartered or were founded in the city. Also, other major labels, such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, and Versace have luxury boutiques in Rome, primarily along its prestigious and upscale Via dei Condotti.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman cuisine\n\n![](image)*Spaghetti alla carbonara*, a typical Roman dish\nRome's cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes. Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the ancient age. Ancient Roman cuisine was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques.[188]\n\n\nLater, during the Renaissance, Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was Bartolomeo Scappi, who was a chef working for Pius IV; he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook *Opera dell'arte del cucinare* was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance cuisine and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a fork.[189]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Concia di zucchine*, an example of Roman-Jewish cuisine\nThe Testaccio, Rome's trade and slaughterhouse area, was often known as the \"belly\" or \"slaughterhouse\" of Rome, and was inhabited by butchers, or *vaccinari*.[190] The most common or ancient Roman cuisine included the \"fifth quarter\".[190] The old-fashioned *coda alla vaccinara* (oxtail cooked in the way of butchers)[190] is still one of the city's most popular meals and is part of most of Rome's restaurants' menus. Lamb is also a very popular part of Roman cuisine, and is often roasted with spices and herbs.[190]\n\n\nIn the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby Campagna, as lamb and vegetables (globe artichokes are common).[191] In parallel, Roman Jews – present in the city since the 1st century BC – developed their own cuisine, the *cucina giudaico-romanesca*.\n\n\nExamples of Roman dishes include *saltimbocca alla romana* – a veal cutlet, Roman-style, topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; *carciofi alla romana* – artichokes Roman-style, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; *carciofi alla giudia* – artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; *spaghetti alla carbonara* – spaghetti with bacon, eggs and pecorino; and *gnocchi di semolino alla romana* – semolina dumpling, Roman-style.[192]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of films set in Rome and List of films set in ancient Rome\n\n![](image)Entrance to the Cinecittà studios, the largest film studio in Europe[193]\nRome hosts the Cinecittà Studios,[194] the largest film and television production facility in continental Europe and the centre of the Italian cinema, where many of today's biggest box office hits are filmed. The 99-acre (40 ha) studio complex is 9.0 km (5.6 mi) from the centre of Rome and is part of one of the biggest production communities in the world, second only to Hollywood, with well over 5,000 professionals – from period costume makers to visual effects specialists. More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFounded in 1937 by Benito Mussolini, the studios were bombed by the Western Allies during the Second World War. In the 1950s, Cinecittà was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with Federico Fellini. Today, Cinecittà is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walkout\" with a completed film.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stadio Olimpico, home of A.S. Roma and S.S. Lazio, is one of the largest in Europe, with a capacity of over 70,000.[195]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Rome, as in the rest of the country.\nThe city hosted the final games of the 1934 and 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nThe latter took place in the Stadio Olimpico, which is also the shared home stadium for local Serie A clubs S.S. Lazio, founded in 1900, and A.S. Roma, founded in 1927, whose rivalry in the Derby della Capitale has become a staple of Roman sports culture.[196]\nFootballers who play for these teams and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been the case with players such as Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi (both for A.S. Roma), and Alessandro Nesta (for S.S. Lazio).\n\n\n\n![](image)Stadio dei Marmi\nRome hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics, with great success, using many ancient sites such as the Villa Borghese and the Thermae of Caracalla as venues. For the Olympic Games many new facilities were built, notably the new large Olympic Stadium (which was then enlarged and renewed to host several matches and the final of the 1990 FIFA World Cup), the Stadio Flaminio, the Villaggio Olimpico (Olympic Village, created to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district), ecc. Rome made a bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics but it was withdrawn.[197][198]\n\n\nFurther, Rome hosted the 1991 EuroBasket and is home to the internationally recognised basketball team Virtus Roma. Rugby union is gaining wider acceptance. Until 2011 the Stadio Flaminio was the home stadium for the Italy national rugby union team, which has been playing in the Six Nations Championship since 2000. The team now plays home games at the Stadio Olimpico because the Stadio Flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity and safety. Rome is home to local rugby union teams such as Rugby Roma (winner of five Italian championships), Unione Rugby Capitolina and S.S. Lazio 1927 (rugby union branch of the multisport club S.S. Lazio).\n\n\nEvery May, Rome hosts the ATP Masters Series tennis tournament on the clay courts of the Foro Italico. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the Giro d'Italia three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. Other local sports teams include volleyball (M. Roma Volley), handball or waterpolo.\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Rome\n\n![](image)Rome–Fiumicino Airport was the tenth busiest airport in Europe in 2016.\n![](image)Port of Civitavecchia\nRome is at the centre of the radial network of roads that roughly follow the lines of the ancient Roman roads which began at the Capitoline Hill and connected Rome with its empire. Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about 10 km (6 mi) from the Capitol, by the ring-road (the *Grande Raccordo Anulare* or *GRA*).\n\n\nDue to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is the principal railway node for central Italy. Rome's main railway station, Termini, is one of the largest railway stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day. The second-largest station in the city, Roma Tiburtina, has been redeveloped as a high-speed rail terminus.[199] As well as frequent high-speed day trains to all major Italian cities, Rome is linked nightly by 'boat train' sleeper services to Sicily, and internationally by overnight sleeper services to Munich and Vienna.\n\n\nRome is served by three airports. The intercontinental Leonardo da Vinci International Airport, Italy's chief airport is located in the nearby Fiumicino, south-west of Rome. The older Rome Ciampino Airport is a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as \"Ciampino Airport\", as it is located beside Ciampino, south-east of Rome. A third airport, the Roma-Urbe Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about 6 km (4 mi) north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights. The main airport system of the city (composed of Fiumicino and Ciampino), with 32.8 million passengers transported in 2022, is the second busiest airport system in Italy.[200]\n\n\nAlthough the city has its own quarter on the Mediterranean Sea (Lido di Ostia), this has only a marina and a small channel-harbour for fishing boats. The main harbour which serves Rome is Port of Civitavecchia, located about 62 km (39 mi) northwest of the city.[201]\n\n\nThe city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.[202] Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during daylight hours. Areas, where these restrictions apply, are known as Limited Traffic Zones (*Zona a Traffico Limitato* (ZTL)). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in Trastevere, Testaccio and San Lorenzo has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.\n\n\n\n![](image)Roma Metrorail and Underground map, 2016\n![](image)Conca d'Oro metro station\nA three-line metro system called the *Metropolitana* operates in Rome. Construction on the first branch started in the 1930s.[203] The line had been planned to quickly connect the main railway station with the newly planned E42 area in the southern suburbs, where 1942 the World Fair was supposed to be held. The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed Esposizione Universale Roma in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.\n\n\nThe A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999–2000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. The A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of €500 million. B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of 3.9 km (2 mi).\n\n\nA third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of €3 billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of 25.5 km (16 mi). It will partly replace the existing Termini-Pantano rail line. It will feature full automated, driverless trains.[204] The first section with 15 stations connecting Pantano with the quarter of Centocelle in the eastern part of the city, opened on 9 November 2014.[205] The end of the work was scheduled in 2015, but archaeological findings often delay underground construction work.\n\n\nA fourth line, D line, is also planned. It will have 22 stations over a distance of 20 km (12 mi).
