In the case of jersey numbers, they are usually no longer available for future players to wear, although they can ask for permission from players whose jerseys are retired. Teams usually display these numbers by hanging banners on the rafters inside their home arena. As of 2022, only two teams in the NBA do not have any retired numbers: the Los Angeles Clippers and the Toronto Raptors. Two players have had their numbers retired by teams they did not play for, and only one player (Bill Russell) had his number retired league wide.\n\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n**Key:**\n\n\n\n † \nInducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame\n ‡ \nNumber retired league-wide\n\n\nRetired NBA numbers\n| No.\n | Name\n | Team\n | Pos.\n | Years with franchise\n | Note\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 | Bob Pettit†\n | Atlanta Hawks | F | 1954–1965 | Did not play for franchise in Atlanta.

A Texas Mr. Basketball in high school, he played one season of college basketball for Georgia Tech before declaring for the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\nWhile at Toronto, Bosh became a five-time NBA All-Star, was named to the All-NBA Second Team once, played for the U.S. national team (with whom he won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics), and supplanted former fan favorite Vince Carter as the face and leader of the Raptors franchise. In the 2006–07 season, Bosh led the Raptors to their first playoff appearance in five years and their first-ever division title. He left Toronto in 2010 as the franchise's all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, and minutes played.[1]\n\n\nIn 2010, after seven seasons with the Raptors, Bosh entered into a sign-and-trade deal whereby he was traded to the Miami Heat.[2] In Miami, he joined fellow stars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James; the trio became known as the Big Three. Bosh spent the second half of his career with Miami, appearing in the NBA Finals each year from 2011 to 2014 and winning NBA titles in 2012 and 2013. He made the NBA All-Star team every year during his time in Miami. Bosh's career was cut short by a blood clotting condition that the NBA ruled to be a career-ending illness.[3][4] He played his final NBA game on February 9, 2016.[5] Notwithstanding the NBA's ruling, Bosh fought to resume his playing career for three years[6] before announcing in February 2019 that he intended to retire.[7] The same year, the Heat retired his No. 1 jersey.[8][9] In 2021, Bosh was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\nSeeking to promote sports and education amongst youths in Dallas and Toronto, Bosh set up the Chris Bosh Foundation and regularly speaks to youths about the benefits of reading.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn to Noel and Freida Bosh in Dallas, Texas,[11] Bosh was raised in Hutchins, a suburb of the city.[12] A family-oriented person, Bosh would often play basketball in the house with his younger brother, Joel.[13] At the early age of four years old, he started learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym where his father played pick-up games.[14] Since Bosh was always tall for his age, he was accustomed to out-rebounding his peers whenever he played;[15] but he only started learning the game of basketball seriously around fourth grade, doing so at a playground near his grandmother's house.[13]\n\n\nAs a child, Bosh participated in karate and gymnastics.[16] He also played baseball up until high school, chiefly as a first baseman according to his preference.[13]\n\n\nGrowing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influence on his personality and considers NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, after whom he modeled his play.[15] Academically, Bosh always excelled in school[17] as he was a member of the National Honor Society and several student engineering organizations.[16]\n\n\nBosh began garnering significant attention from college recruiters after he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and to the *USA Today* National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.[18]\n\n\nThe 6-foot-11 teenager helped Lincoln High capture the Class 4A state title as he delivered 23 points and 17 rebounds to go along with 9 blocks. Bosh was subsequently named High School Player of the Year by Basketball America; Powerade Player of the Year in Texas; a first-team All-American by *Parade*, McDonald's, and EA Sports; a second-team all-American by *USA Today* and *SLAM* Magazine; a first-team all-state player; and \"Mr. Basketball\" in Texas by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches.[18] With his combination of grades and basketball skills, Bosh's name was on a number of college recruiting lists. The University of Florida and University of Memphis among them made serious overtures, but it was Paul Hewitt, coach of Georgia Tech, who made the best impression. Bosh felt that Hewitt had his best interests at heart and respected his aspiration to play professionally; moreover, he was sufficiently impressed by what he saw of Georgia Tech's transition offense.[17]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nBosh eventually chose to follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management.[13] There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so.[11] Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, but by the end of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA.[17] He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season[11] and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career.[15]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors (2003–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh shooting a free throw during a game in the 2005–06 season\n#### Rookie year (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nIn what is widely regarded as one of the strongest draft classes in NBA history, which included future All-Stars LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade,[17] Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in the 2003 NBA draft and was signed on July 8, 2003.[19] Prior to his signing, however, other NBA teams made offers for Bosh as they knew Toronto needed a veteran scorer, and Raptors star Vince Carter himself pressed for a trade. General Manager Glen Grunwald turned everyone down.[17]\n\n\nIn his rookie season, Bosh was forced to play out of position as the Raptors' starting center after Antonio Davis was traded to the Chicago Bulls.[20] Night after night, the teenager with the \"slim frame\" battled against opponents who had a significant size and strength advantage over him.[20] Bosh—who cited teammate Michael Curry as his mentor[15]—was often praised by his coaches for his heart, and willingness to play through pain and injuries resulting from his lack of body strength compared to some of the league's strong forwards and centers.[21] Bosh's contributions were not unnoticed by teammates either,[22] as he averaged 11.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and 33.5 minutes in 75 games, leading all rookies in rebounding and blocks, and setting a franchise record for most rebounds in a rookie season with 557.[11] Bosh was rewarded by being selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2003–04 season.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Heralded as the new hope (2004–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh and his teammates in a 2005–06 game against the Milwaukee Bucks. From left: Pape Sow, Bosh, Mike James and Morris Peterson.\nWith the departure of the disenchanted franchise face of the team, Vince Carter, in December 2004, Bosh was simultaneously anointed as the new leader around whom Toronto would build.[23] In the remaining games following Carter's departure, the power forward averaged 18.4 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 38.1 minutes per game, improving in every major statistical category.[11] He was awarded his first ever NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played between January 3 and 9, 2005.[11] As the season drew to a close, analysts predicted that Bosh would become an All-Star one day.[24][25] Bosh ended the 2004–05 season as the leading scorer and leading rebounder for the team on 21 and 46 occasions respectively.[11]\n\n\nPrior to the 2005–06 season, Bosh was named as one of Toronto's team captains. Bosh continued to work on his game as he consistently chalked up double-doubles, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage for the first half of the season.[26] On February 9, 2006, for the first time in his career, Bosh was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference.[11] He was only the third Raptor to make an All-Star game, after Carter and Antonio Davis. Bosh's selection was just three days after he was named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career.[26] In March 2006, following a season-ending injury to Bosh,[27] the Raptors hit a 1–10 skid.[28] This highlighted Bosh's importance as the centerpiece of the offense, as well as the leader of the team. The Raptors finished the season 27–55 and Bosh averaged 22.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.[29]\n\n\n\n#### Leader of the division champions (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh improved his numbers in ppg and rpg in the 2006–07 season and had to lead a vastly different team from the 2005–06 roster.\nDespite a major off-season revamp of the Raptors roster—including the departure of good friends Mike James and Charlie Villanueva—Bosh officially signed a three-year contract extension with a player option for a fourth year on July 14, 2006.[30][31] The deal was reportedly worth US$65 million over four years.[32] Upon signing the contract, Bosh said \"I think the future is very positive for the franchise... change was needed... we have a lot of guys who just want to win and are willing to work hard.\"[32] During the same press conference, Bosh also announced a donation of $1 million to a Toronto charity, known as Community Legacy Programs.[30]\n\n\nAfter a shaky start to the Raptors' 2006–07 campaign, the Raptors managed to surpass the .500 mark as the All-Star break approached.[33] Bosh's play and leadership were pivotal to this run and as an increasing recognition of his abilities, on January 25, 2007, he was named an All-Star starter for the East in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. Bosh received the second highest number of votes among all Eastern Conference forwards.[34] This was his first All-Star start and second overall All-Star appearance, having averaged over 22 points and 11 rebounds in the first half of the season.[34] On January 31, 2007, in a game against the Washington Wizards, Bosh scored a 65-foot (20 m) buzzer-beating shot to end the third quarter of the game.[35] He shot 15-of-15 after missing his first four shots.[36] Bosh's in-form streak enabled him to be selected Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January 2007.[37] He had averaged 25.4 points and 9.1 rebounds while leading the Raptors to a 10–5 record in that month. On February 7, 2007, Bosh's career-high 41 points prompted the home fans to chant \"MVP\"—an unprecedented event in the Air Canada Centre.[38] Two days later, Bosh collected 29 points and 11 rebounds against the Los Angeles Lakers, shooting 10-of-10 in the second half.[39]\n\n\nOn March 28, 2007, Bosh became the new franchise record holder for double-doubles in a home win against the Miami Heat.[40] He was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the third time in his career shortly after,[41] having led Toronto to clinch a playoff berth for the first time in five years. Toronto went on to win its first ever division title, and concluded the regular season with a 47–35 record, including a 30–11 home record, both franchise records.[42] As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in the first round of the 2007 NBA playoffs. The series drew much media attention as Carter, who had left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances, was back at the ACC as a Net.[43] Toronto's inexperience was evident as they struggled offensively throughout the game, to eventually lose 96–91.[43] The Raptors won game 2 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds.[44] The Nets won Games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5.[45] The Nets went on to clinch the series with a win in game 6.[46] Bosh averaged a double-double with 22.6 ppg and 10.7 rpg for the regular season, both career-highs, and posted 17.5 ppg and 9.0 rpg for the playoffs.[29] He was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Struggles (2007–2009)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2007\nBefore the 2007–08 season began, Andrea Bargnani, the number one pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was slated to start at center and Bosh at power forward to form a strong Toronto frontcourt and Jason Kapono, a three-point specialist, was acquired via free agency from the Miami Heat to add offensive firepower; however, as the season unfolded, neither plans materialized as hoped.[48] Bosh himself had a slow start to the season, but as mid-season approached, his form picked up and he was named Player of the Week for the second week of January.[49] On January 31, 2008, he was selected to be on the Eastern Conference team for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game.[50] Bosh missed 15 games throughout the season, but the Raptors still managed to conclude the regular season with a 41–41 record, thus clinching the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 NBA playoffs. However, they were defeated by the Orlando Magic in the first round, losing 4–1.[51]\n\n\nThe first-round series against the Magic was touted as the matchup between two of the league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard.[52] Howard dominated throughout the series, while Bosh had a series-best effort in game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds.[53] General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, \"Whether it's protecting [Bosh] inside the paint, getting a little bit more of a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better\", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul.[54] Bosh said after the loss, \"They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good.\"[51] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.[55]\n\n\nTo provide Bosh with an experienced frontcourt partner, the Raptors pulled a blockbuster trade prior to the 2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers.[56] Bosh—who had won an Olympic gold medal with the national team at Beijing 2008—started the season strong. He averaged 26 points, 10 rebounds and 3.7 assists in his first three games and was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the fifth time in his career.[57] A week later, he became Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds, surpassing Antonio Davis's record.[58] While Bosh and O'Neal formed a formidable partnership in the frontcourt, the Raptors struggled to surpass the .500 mark. The principal deficiency of previous campaigns—wing players—continued to upend Toronto's progress.[59] With the Raptors at 8–9, head coach Sam Mitchell was sacked and replaced by Jay Triano.[60] Despite the move, injuries and weaknesses in the roster meant that the Raptors entered the All-Star break 13 games under .500.[61] On January 29, 2009, Bosh was named an All-Star reserve,[62] but an injury ruled him out of the game. Two weeks later, in a bid to bring in a wing player and create greater salary flexibility, O'Neal and Jamario Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[61] The trade did not improve the team's win–loss record, however, and the Raptors were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining.[63] The bright spark in Bosh's campaign was his career-high 22.7 points per game, as well as his being one of two players in the league that season (the other being Dwight Howard) to average a 20/10 in points and rebounds.[64] On April 20, 2009, Colangelo announced that he would offer Bosh a contract extension during the summer,[65] which Bosh later refused to sign.[66]\n\n\n\n#### Overhauling the roster (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nTo prepare for the 2009–10 season, Bosh worked out under Ken Roberson, looking to add 20 pounds (9 kg) and bring his weight up to 250 lb (110 kg).[66] Following the failure of the 2008–09 campaign, Colangelo knew that he had to shake up the roster to persuade Bosh to stay, and the Raptors were one of the busiest teams in the pre-season market.[67] They opened their season with a win against the heavily favored Cleveland Cavaliers, in which Bosh scored 21 points and pulled down 16 rebounds.[68] Bosh went on a tear, averaging 25.4 points and 11.9 rebounds in the first 16 games, but the Raptors were only able to win seven of those games.[68][69] The Raptors crossed into 2010 with a 16–17 record, and on January 3, 2010, Bosh overtook Vince Carter as Toronto's all-time leader in total points scored.[70] After pulling together a string of wins, Toronto were .500 after 40 games. Bosh was the league leader in double-doubles at the time, being only one of two players in the league who averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game.[71] On January 20, 2010, he scored a career-high 44 points in a loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, while collecting his 220th career double-double.[72] That same month, Bosh was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team,[73] and was Eastern Conference Player of the Week.[74] After the All-Star break, the Raptors went on several losing streaks and an injury to Bosh exacerbated the situation. As the regular season came to a close, the Raptors went from being the fifth seed before the All-Star break to fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot with the Chicago Bulls. After recording his 44th double-double on March 22, 2010, Bosh became the Raptors' all-time leader in number of double-doubles in a season. On April 5, 2010, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, winning the honor for the seventh time in his career (tying Carter for the most in franchise history).[75] However, Bosh was unable to play in a pivotal match against the Bulls on April 11, 2010. The blowout loss cost Toronto their tie-breaker and ultimately the eighth seed, as the Bulls finished with 41 wins to Toronto's 40.[76]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2010–2017)[edit]\n\n\n#### Joining the Heat and debut season (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2010\nAfter the 2009–10 season was over, there was much speculation over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. Bosh signed with the Miami Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal, which sent two 2011 first-round draft picks to the Raptors (Norris Cole and Jonas Valančiūnas were later selected).[77][78] Bosh was a part of the first player-created NBA superteam.[79] Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, \"[K]now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me. I've loved every minute here and I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart...\"[80] Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, he was one of only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.[81]\n\n\nDespite being widely tipped as contenders, the Heat got off to a tentative 9–8 start. The Heat managed to go on to compile a 21–1 record, however, and were jostling with the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls for pole position in the Eastern Conference as mid-season approached.[82] Miami finished the regular season with 58 wins and faced Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs. Miami won the series in five games, and also prevailed in five games in the semi-finals against Boston. In the Conference Finals against Chicago, Bosh was particularly instrumental, averaging 23.2 points in the 4–1 series win. He was slow off the blocks in the Finals against Dallas, shooting below .300 in the first two games, but scored the winning shot in game 3 to give Miami a 2–1 lead. That was the last game Miami won, as Dallas won the next three to win its first-ever championship. Bosh was seen sobbing as he walked to the locker room following the loss.\n\n\n\n#### Consecutive NBA championships (2011–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in a layup line before a game against the Dallas Mavericks in 2012\nOn January 5, 2012, Bosh led the Heat to a 116–109 triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks, highlighted by a three-point shot he made to force the game into overtime with 0.6 seconds left to play in the fourth quarter. Bosh finished the game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocked shots.[83] By season's end, the Heat had embraced a small-ball strategy that featured Bosh at the center position. In the playoffs, Bosh averaged 14.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a game. In game 1 of the Conference Semi-finals against the Indiana Pacers, he suffered a lower abdominal strain that forced him to miss the rest of the series and the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston. Bosh returned in the Conference Finals against the Celtics. He was moved to center for the remainder of the playoffs, while James, who had filled in at power forward during his absence, remained at that position.[84][85] Boston pushed Miami to seven games, and in the final game, Bosh scored 19 points, including 3-of-4 shooting from three-point range, to help the Heat advance to their second straight NBA Finals, this time against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder won the first game of the series before Miami rolled to a 4–1 victory, giving Bosh his first NBA championship. Bosh scored 24 points in the deciding game 5 and averaged 14.6 points and 9.4 rebounds in the Finals.\n\n\nBosh remained the Heat's starting center during the 2012–13 season. On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra.[86] The Heat achieved the league's best record and swept through the first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in five games, with Bosh scoring 20 points to go with 19 rebounds in a crucial game 3 win in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs, as the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven-game series against Indiana. The Heat and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs blew out Miami in game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead. In game 4, Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to complement Wade's 32 points and James's 33 points to bolster the Heat's win, tying the series. San Antonio would bounce back in game 5 to force the Heat to win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide-open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA championship.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Coming up short (2013–2014)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Bosh played and started in 79 games, averaging 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He also hit a career-high 74 three-point shots on 33 percent shooting from beyond the arc. In the playoffs, Bosh helped the Heat return to the NBA Finals, where they faced the San Antonio Spurs once again. This time, however, the Heat were outclassed by the Spurs, as they lost the series in five games.\n\n\n\n#### Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 30, 2014, after wide speculation that he would join the Houston Rockets, Bosh re-signed with the Heat to a five-year, $118 million contract after LeBron James announced he was leaving Miami to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[88][89] After averaging 21.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals over the first 23 games of the 2014–15 season, Bosh was ruled out indefinitely on December 15 with a strained calf.[90] He went on to miss eight games before returning on December 29 against the Orlando Magic.[91] After playing in the 2015 All-Star Game, Bosh was admitted to a Miami hospital for lung tests during the All-Star break.[92][93] On February 21, 2015, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a blood clot in one of his lungs.[94]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2015, Bosh made his return to the court in the Heat's season opener against the Charlotte Hornets, recording 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 104–94 win.[95] On November 10, 2015, he scored a then season-high 30 points in a 101–88 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[96] On December 28, 2015, he recorded 24 points and 12 rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets, and hit a career-best 5-of-5 from three-point range.[97] On January 4, 2016, he recorded a season-high 31 points and 11 rebounds in a 103–100 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers.[98] Though he was voted to play in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, and selected to compete in the Three-Point Contest, due to a calf injury, Bosh was forced to withdraw from both.[99]\n\n\nA blood clot in his leg again forced Bosh to miss time following the 2016 All-Star break. He faced increasing pressure from physicians and the Heat organization to sit out the rest of the season because of the potential dangers of the recurring medical condition.[100] Following the Heat's February 9 game against San Antonio, Bosh did not play any regular-season or playoff games for Miami in 2016.[3][101][102] On May 4, 2016, the Heat announced that Bosh would be held out for the remainder of the playoffs.[3]\n\n\n\n#### Comeback attempts and retirement (2016–2019)[edit]\n\n\nBosh was initially optimistic about a return to the Heat for the 2016–17 season, and the organization had become increasingly hopeful that he would be cleared for camp. Those hopes quickly faded due to Bosh's continued issues with blood clotting.[103] In September 2016, Bosh failed his physical exam and was not cleared by the team to participate in training camp.[104] On September 26, 2016, Heat president Pat Riley said that the team viewed Bosh's career with the team as over.[105] In May 2017, Bosh and the Heat reportedly reached a unique agreement in which Bosh would leave the Heat without his salary taking up the team's salary cap space for the 2017–18 season.[106]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2017, the NBA ruled that Bosh's blood clotting issues were a career-ending illness, meaning the Heat would be allowed to remove his contract from their salary cap once they officially released him.[4] Two days later, the Heat announced that they had waived Bosh, ending a seven-year stint with the organization.[107] Following Bosh's release, Heat President Pat Riley said, \"The number '1' will never be worn by another player and we can't wait to someday hang his jersey in the rafters\".[108] In February 2018, Bosh declared himself on the comeback trail, having refused to rule out a return to the NBA.[6][109]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2019, Bosh announced that he was no longer pursuing his NBA career[110] and that he planned to retire from the NBA when his jersey was retired by the Heat.[111] The Heat retired Bosh's No. 1 jersey on March 26 before a regular season game against the Orlando Magic.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|

when he was selected as a member of the 2002 USA Basketball Junior World Championship Qualifying Team that finished with a 4–1 record and the bronze medal.[112]\n\n\nAfter his NBA career began, Bosh was named in March 2006 to the 2006–2008 United States men's national basketball team program, and helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour.[112] In August 2006, Bosh was named as a member of the 2006 USA World Championship Team.[112] Together with fellow 2003 draftees Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kirk Hinrich, this team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal, defeating former 2004 Olympic champion Argentina.[113] Bosh was ranked sixth in field goal percentage.[112]\n\n\nFollowing the 2006–07 season, Bosh was named to the team that would compete in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. However, he sustained a foot injury and withdrew from the squad.[114] On June 23, 2008, he was named to the team that would compete in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.[115] During the tournament itself, Bosh operated as the main backup to center Dwight Howard as Team USA went unbeaten in all eight games en route to the gold medal, defeating Spain in the final.[116] He averaged 9.1 points per game, and led the team in rebounds with 6.1 a game.[117]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Bosh withdrew his name from consideration for the 2012 Olympics in London to recover from a lower abdominal strain that kept him out of some playoff games.[118]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> You are not going to see a whole lot of screaming and hollering at guys... He is a guy that is going to pull somebody aside and say it in a positive way, and I think it goes a lot farther that way.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAnthony Parker on Bosh's leadership[119]\n\n![](image)The mid-range jump shot was one of Bosh's trademark moves.\nBosh traditionally played the power forward position, including during his first season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) and 235 pounds (107 kg),[29] Bosh possessed excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size.[120] He was particularly noted for his ability to drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he was also proficient, but he was also known for his well-developed jump shot.[121] Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: \"We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work either. I don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth.\"[122] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions.[123] He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left.[124] It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his \"arrival\" to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime.[11] When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot .343 from the three-point arc for the season; he improved to .400 the following season.[29] Because of his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.\n\n\nBosh was noted for his leadership. When he was the leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to maintain his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic.[121] However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who made bad calls on the court.[125] Throughout his career, comparisons were made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.\n\n\n\n## Honors and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* **NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Month**: January 2007\n* **9× NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week**: January 3, 2005; January 30, 2006; March 26, 2007; January 7, 2008; October 28, 2008; February 1, 2010; April 5, 2010; December 23, 2013; October 28, 2014\n* **NBA Atlantic Division champion**: 2007\n* **4× NBA Southeast Division champion**: 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n* **2× NBA champion**: 2012, 2013\n* **11× NBA All-Star**: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016\n* **All-NBA Second Team**: 2007\n* **NBA All-Rookie Team**: 2004\n* **2× NBA Rookie All-Star Game**: 2004, 2005\n* **3× NBA Shooting Stars champion** (with Swin Cash and Dominique Wilkins) 2013, 2014, 2015[126]\n* Bronze medal winner with Team USA at the 2006 FIBA World Championship\n* Gold medal winner with Team USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics\n* Third-youngest player in NBA history to record 1,000 rebounds[11]\n* Fourth-youngest player in NBA history to record 20 points and 20 rebounds in a game[11]\n* Toronto's first player to achieve 10,000 points\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in defensive rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds per game\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds per game in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in blocks\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws made[127]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws made in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws attempted[127]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws attempted in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in double-doubles[40]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in double-doubles in a season\n* NBA Sportsmanship Award (divisional winner): 2007–08[128]\n* Elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh at the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards\nBesides his on-the-court exploits, Bosh was a National Honor Society member and graduated with honors from Lincoln.[14] He is also a member of the National Society of Black Engineers and the Dallas Association of Minority Engineers.[14] Following his success in the NBA, Bosh soon had his own YouTube channel,[129] and has since made various TV appearances. In December 2009, First Ink, a DVD featuring comedic digital shorts and a documentary about Bosh, was released. The DVD was filmed during the summer of 2009.[130] A fan of the *X-Men* television series as a child, Bosh voiced the Marvel Comics character Heimdall in an episode of *Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.* in 2014.[131][132] He also made appearances on episodes of *Entourage* and *Parks and Recreation*.[133]\n\n\nIn the field of philanthropy, Bosh established the Chris Bosh Foundation in 2004. Remembering the challenges he faced as a youth,[14] Bosh founded the organization to help younger people in academics and athletics.[134] The Foundation, with programs in Toronto and Dallas, has worked closely with organizations such as the Toronto Special Olympics to raise important funding for community projects.[14] Bosh's mother, Freida, has served as CEO of the Foundation.[134] As an avid reader, Bosh also regularly speaks to groups of children about the benefits of reading,[12] and has received the NBA Community Assist Award for his active contributions for the Raptors community development program in Toronto and Dallas during the course of the NBA campaign.[135] In November 2008, Bosh pledged to donate $75,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada.[136] He is also an advocate for increased computer literacy in schools, supporting the non-profit code.org.[137]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2011, Bosh married Adrienne Williams.[138][139] They renewed their vows on July 16, 2011.[140] The couple have five children, three sons and two daughters.[141][142]\n\n\nBosh has dabbled in hip-hop production. In 2017, alongside record producer, songwriter, and singer Rico Love, Bosh co-produced a song titled \"Miss My Woe\" by Gucci Mane.[143] The song is featured on Gucci's 11th studio album titled, *Mr. Davis*.\n\n\nIn June 2021, Bosh published his book, *Letters to a Young Athlete.*[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n### Paternity lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nOn March 24, 2009, it was reported that Bosh's former girlfriend, Allison Mathis, was seeking child support and sole custody of their daughter, Trinity (born November 2, 2008). Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home.[147] Three days later, it was reported that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid.[148] Mathis' lawyer also told the press, \"My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything on our side... She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to have a good relationship with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult.\"[148]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* Toronto Raptors accomplishments and records\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chiari, Mike. \"Chris Bosh on NBA Career: 'I've Made the Decision Not to Pursue It Anymore'\". *Bleacher Report*.

Wade is also Miami's all-time leader in points, games, assists, steals, shots made, and shots taken.[5] Wade is widely regarded as one of the greatest shooting guards in NBA history.[6][7][8] Wade is currently the host of the American adaptation of *The Cube*.\n\n\nAfter a successful college basketball career with the Marquette Golden Eagles, including leading the team to the Final Four in 2003, Wade was drafted fifth overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Heat. In his third season, Wade led the Heat to their first NBA Championship and was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Wade led the United States men's basketball team, commonly known as the \"Redeem Team\", in scoring and helped them capture the gold medal. In the 2008–09 season, Wade led the league in both total points (2,386) and points per game (30.2), the latter stat earning him his sole NBA scoring title. Wade was selected as the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 2010. With LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Wade helped guide Miami to four consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 to 2014, and won back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. Wade briefly left Miami to play for the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers throughout 2016–2018 before returning to Miami to finish his playing career and retire with the Heat in 2019. The Heat retired his #3 jersey in 2020. He purchased a minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz in 2021. In October 2021, Wade was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[9] In 2023, it was announced that Wade would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nWade was born the second of two children to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr. in Chicago, Illinois, on January 17, 1982. Wade attributes the uncommon spelling of his and his father's first name to his grandmother.[11] JoLinda already had two children when she married Wade's father, and with him she had Dwyane and his older sister Tragil. The pair separated when Wade was four months old. Wade described his early childhood in the South Side of Chicago as trying.[12]\n\n\nWhen his parents divorced, JoLinda was given custody of the two children. JoLinda struggled with drug addiction and often committed crimes that sent her to prison. At eight years old, Tragil tricked her brother Dwyane into thinking they were going to the movies, only to take him to live with his father and stepmother. Wade visited his mother on occasion until his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois, after which Wade would not see her for two years.[13]\n\n\nWade turned to basketball and football, avoiding the temptations of drugs and gangs. Wade credited Tragil as the person most responsible for pointing him in the right direction.[14] Wade grew up idolizing Michael Jordan and modeled his game after him.[15] On October 14, 2001, as Wade's basketball career blossomed, JoLinda vowed to turn her life around. She says that she has not used drugs since 2003.[16]\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\nWade played basketball and football for Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. He immediately excelled as a wide receiver and also played as a backup quarterback, but success in basketball took longer.[14] He grew four inches by the start of his junior year and emerged as the team leader, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds.[17]\n\n\nWade's improvement continued into his senior year, when he averaged 27 points and 11 rebounds.[18] He led the Bulldogs to a 24–5 record and to a Class AA Eisenhower Sectional appearance. Wade set school records for points scored (676) and steals made (106).[19] He credited coach Jack Fitzgerald as a seminal and positive influence. Wade was recruited to play basketball only by Marquette, Illinois State, and DePaul, due to disqualifyingly low ACT scores.[13]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nWade committed to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to play under coach Tom Crean. In his freshman year, Wade was sidelined by NCAA Proposition 48, which set academic eligibility requirements for participation in Division I sports. Effort and tutoring[20] sufficiently raised his academic standing so that he became eligible by the start of his sophomore year.[21]\n\n\n\n### 2001–02 season[edit]\n\n\nWade led the Marquette Golden Eagles in scoring with 17.8 points (ppg) and led Conference USA in both steals per game with 2.47 and 2-point field goals made with 205;[22] he averaged 6.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists.[23] Marquette finished with a 26–7 record, their best since the 1993–94 season.[19]\n\n\n\n### 2002–03 season[edit]\n\n\nWade again led the school in scoring with 21.5 points and the Golden Eagles finished with a 27–6 record.[24] Three days after JoLinda was released from prison, she saw Wade play basketball for the first time in five years as Marquette upset the Cincinnati Bearcats, 70–61, to capture the Conference USA title on March 8, 2003. He helped bring the Golden Eagles to the Final Four for the first time since their 1977 national championship season. Wade was subsequently named to the All-America First Team by the Associated Press (AP), making him the first basketball player from Marquette to receive the distinction since 1978.[19]\n\n\nWade's performance during the Midwest Regional final drew national attention. Against a top-seeded Kentucky team, he delivered 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists, including a memorable breakaway dunk, as Marquette upset the Wildcats, 83–69, and advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1977. Wade's triple double was the fourth ever recorded in NCAA tournament history. The Golden Eagles finished their season as No.6 in the AP Poll, Marquette's highest ranking since 1976–77. Wade was named the MVP of the Midwest Regional. His performance earned him a high NBA draft projection.[25] As a result, Wade skipped his senior year to enter the 2003 NBA draft.\n\n\nMarquette retired his jersey on February 3, 2007. It ordinarily requires student-athletes to have graduated for jersey retirement, but made an exception for Wade.[26]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2003–2016)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie year (2003–04)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade dunking the ball during the 2004 Rookie Challenge game for the Rookies team\nSelected fifth in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, Wade became the highest ranked of only four Marquette first round draft picks.[27] Wade quickly emerged as a productive player, averaging 16.2 points on 46.5% shooting as well as 4 rebounds and 4.5 assists.[28] After a 5–15 start, the Heat gradually improved to finish 42–40 and qualify for the playoffs.[29] Wade served up outstanding postseason performances, particularly against the Indiana Pacers during the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[27] Wade earned a unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team[27] and finished third in Rookie of the Year voting (after LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony).[27] He placed among the top five rookies in several statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played.[27]\n\n\nIn the first playoff game, Wade hit a running jumper with 1.3 seconds left in the final quarter to give the Heat an 81–79 victory over the New Orleans Hornets. Winning that series 4–3, the Heat faced the Indiana Pacers, who were the top-seeded team with the best record in the NBA. The Heat lost the series 4–2. Wade became only the fourth rookie in the shot clock era to lead his team in points and assists during the postseason.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Breakthrough year (2004–05)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with the ball versus the Milwaukee Bucks in 2005\nThe Heat traded with the Los Angeles Lakers for center Shaquille O'Neal. Improving on their previous season's 42–40 record by 17 games, Miami went 59–23, leading the Eastern Conference.[30] Wade earned a reserve slot in the season's All-Star Game; adding 14 points in 24 minutes of play.[28]\n\n\nIn the first round of the 2005 playoffs, Wade averaged 26.3 points, 8.8 assists, and 6 rebounds a night while maintaining a 50% field-goal percentage as the Heat swept the New Jersey Nets.[31] In the second round he averaged 31 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists per game as the Heat swept the Washington Wizards.[31] The Heat lost the Eastern Conference Finals 4–3 to the Detroit Pistons, the previous season's champions. Wade scored 42 points in Game 2 and 36 in Game 3 despite playing with sinusitis, the flu, and a knee strain. He suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 that prevented him from playing in the sixth game and limited him in the seventh.[32][30]\n\n\n\n#### NBA champion and Finals MVP (2005–06)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade at the free throw line\nIn the 2005–06 season, Wade was elected to the All-Star Game as a starter. During 30 minutes of play, he put up 20 points on 9-of-11 field goals.[33] Wade finished the regular season averaging 27.2 points, 6.7 assists, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.95 steals.[34]\n\n\nIn the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Miami played the Chicago Bulls. Wade incurred several injuries, including a severely bruised hip during Game 5.[35] He scored 15 of his 28 points while suffering intense pain, to give the Heat a 3–2 series lead. Wade led Miami past the Detroit Pistons despite experiencing flu-like symptoms in Game 6.[36] In the series-clinching contest, he landed 14 points and 10 assists.[36]\n\n\nDuring the 2006 NBA Finals, Miami faced the Dallas Mavericks. Wade's 42, 36, and 43 points in Games 3, 4, and 5, respectively, helped the Heat go from a 0–2 deficit to a 3–2 series lead.[37] In Game 3, Wade's 42 points tied his playoff-high and his 13 rebounds were a career-high.[38][39] The Heat took Game 6 behind Wade's 36 points, taking the series 4–2, earning Wade the Finals MVP trophy.[40] He became the fifth-youngest player in NBA history to capture the Finals MVP award, and his 34.7 points were the Finals' third-highest among players in their first NBA Finals.[41] His 33.8 player efficiency rating (PER) over the NBA Finals was ranked by John Hollinger of ESPN as the best since the NBA-ABA merger.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Injuries and missing playoffs (2006–2008)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, Wade missed 31 games due to injury; even so, he was elected to his third consecutive All-Star Game and received All-NBA honors. He became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing 31 or more games since Pete Maravich.[27] The Heat struggled with injuries in general and were 20–25 on February 1, 2007.[43] Playing the Houston Rockets on February 21, 2007, Wade dislocated his left shoulder and left the court in a wheelchair.[44] Wade chose to delay surgery and instead rehabilitate his shoulder in time for the postseason.[45] After missing 23 games, Wade returned to the active roster. Sporting a black shoulder sleeve, Wade played 27 minutes and notched 12 points and 8 assists in the 111–103 overtime loss.[46] For the season, Wade averaged 27.4 points, 7.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.1 steals, while shooting 50% from the field; further, he finished the season as the NBA PER leader.[47]\n\n\nDuring the 2007 playoffs, Wade averaged 23.5 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.8 rebounds per contest, but were swept in the first round by the Chicago Bulls.[48] Post-playoffs, Wade underwent a pair of surgeries to repair his dislocated left shoulder and left knee, both of which proved successful. However, the knee ailment, commonly called \"jumper's knee\", prevented Wade from joining USA Basketball in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament over that summer.[49]\n\n\nAfter missing the Tournament of Americas' Olympic Qualifiers as well as the preseason and the first seven games, Wade began the 2007–08 season on November 14, 2007.[50] Despite battling pain in his injured knee throughout the season,[51] Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance.[52] However, the Heat held the worst record in the NBA. Wade's knee problems led Riley sit Wade for the final 21 games to undergo long overdue OssaTron treatment.[53] Wade averaged 24.6 points, 6.9 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.7 steals.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Scoring champion and playoff defeats (2008–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade dribbling the ball in 2009\nAfter months of rehab, he helped the U.S. National Team win gold at the 2008 Olympics, leading the team in scoring. Wade returned to the starting lineup to begin the 2008–09 campaign.[54][55] Early that season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to post at least 40 points, 10 assists and 5 blocks in one game since Alvan Adams in 1976–77.[56] Wade was elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star Game.[57]\n\n\nAfter the All-Star break, Wade recorded 50 points on 56.6% shooting along with 5 rebounds and 5 assists during a blow-out loss to the Orlando Magic;[58] making him the fourth in NBA history to score at least 50 points in a game that his team lost by at least 20.[58] In the very next contest, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and 7 rebounds.[59] Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring 50-plus points since Wilt Chamberlain.[60] Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record, scoring 24 points in the final quarter to secure a 120–115 win over the New York Knicks.[61] For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, plus 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocked shots.[61] In the next game he banked 40-points versus the Cleveland Cavaliers.[62] Wade put up 41 points on 53% shooting along with 9 assists, 7 steals, 7 rebounds and a block in the 107–100 loss.[62] The following game, Wade tied his career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, plus a steal and a block, as the Heat beat the Phoenix Suns 135–129.[63] Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with 30-plus points and 15 or more assists.[63] Less than a week later, Wade hit the buzzer-beater and tied his earlier franchise record with his 78th straight double-digit scoring game in double-overtime against the Chicago Bulls.[64] Wade finished the game with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes of play.[64] Wade joined Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to record that many points and that many assists in a single game while having as high of a field goal percentage.[65] Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning to become the Heat's all-time leading scorer in triple overtime versus the Utah Jazz.[66] Wade finished that 140–129 victory with 50 points to go along with his 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals and 2 blocks.[66]\n\n\nWade became the only player to reach 2,000 points, 500 assists, 150 steals, and 100 blocks as well as the only player under 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) to block upwards of 100 shots in a single season.[67][68] He became the fifth player to accumulate 2,000 points, 500 assists, and 150 steals in a season.[69] Wade helped the Heat clinch a playoff berth and become only the second team to make the postseason after winning 15 or fewer games the season before.[70] In a 122–105 victory over the New York Knicks, Wade recorded a career-high 55 points on 63% field goal shooting and added 9 rebounds and 4 assists.[71] Wade recorded 50 points in only three quarters and was pulled out of the game, one point shy of eclipsing Glen Rice's 56-point franchise record.[71] Wade averaged a league-leading 30.2 points for his first NBA scoring title. He added 7.5 assists, 5 rebounds, 2.2 steals, and 1.3 blocks.[47] Wade wrapped up the season with higher point, assist, steal, and block averages than James and Kobe Bryant, both of whom finished ahead of Wade in the MVP race.\n\n\nOn November 1, in what was only his third game of the 2009–10 season, Wade recorded his 10,000th career point during a 95–87 win against the Chicago Bulls.[72] On November 12, Wade made a spectacular dunk over Cavalier Anderson Varejão. James regarded the dunk as \"great, probably top 10 all-time\".[73] Two days later against the New Jersey Nets, Wade hit another buzzer beater for a one-point win at 81–80.[74] On January 6, Wade scored a season-high 44 points during an overtime loss to the Boston Celtics, the most in a losing effort that season.[75] Wade appeared in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game.[76] Wade was named the game's MVP with 28 points, 11 assists, 5 steals and 6 rebounds.[77]\n\n\nOn February 17, Wade strained his calf. He left the game, ending his personal and the Heat's franchise-record streak of 148 consecutive games with at least 10 points.[78] Wade was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for the fifth time and Player of the Week twice for his play in the month of March. He averaged 26.9 and 7.5 assists, both of which ranked third in the Eastern Conference, and 2.3 steals per game, which ranked first. Wade recorded six 30-point games and had six double-doubles in the month, including a season-high 14 assists.[79]\n\n\nFor the season, Wade averaged 26.6 points on 47.6% field goal shooting to go with 6.5 assists, 4.8 rebounds, 1.8 steals and 1.1 blocks; doing so, he led his team to a 47–35 record and the fifth playoff seed.[47] In the first round, down 0–3 against the Boston Celtics, Wade recorded a career playoff and franchise record with 46 points; he outscored the entire Celtics team in the fourth quarter.[80] It was Wade's sixth career playoff game with at least 40 points.[47] Despite his averaging 33.2 points on 56.4% shooting, 6.8 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1.6 blocks per contest, the Heat fell to Boston in five games.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Big Three era and back-to-back championships (2010–2014)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with his teammate LeBron James\nDuring the off-season, the Miami-Dade County commission renamed the area \"Miami-Wade County\" from July 1 to 7, a week that coincided with the start of free agency, intended to help convince Wade to stay with the Heat.[82] On July 7, it was announced that Wade would sign with Miami, along with Toronto Raptor star Chris Bosh.[83] The following day, LeBron James announced he would join the Heat.[84]\n\n\nIn the first year of the Big 3 Era, the Heat finished with a 58–24 record and earned the second seed in the Eastern Conference. Wade averaged 25.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 1.5 steals while shooting 50%. After defeating the Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics, and Chicago Bulls, the Heat reached the NBA Finals but ultimately fell to the Dallas Mavericks in six games. Wade averaged 26.5 points, 7 rebounds, and 5.2 assists for the Finals and 24.5 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.4 assists for the playoffs.[85]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2012, Wade recorded the third triple-double in the history of the All-Star Game, posting 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, joining Jordan and James. On March 10, 2012, Wade made the game-winning shot against the Indiana Pacers, giving the Heat a 93–91 overtime win. Wade finished the season averaging 22.1 points, 4.8 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals. The Heat defeated the New York Knicks in 5 games and the Indiana Pacers in six games. In Game 6 of the second round, Wade recorded 41 points and 10 rebounds.[86] The Heat prevailed in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals, beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games. Wade averaged 22.6 points. The Heat became the first team in NBA history to win a championship after trailing in three playoff series.\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2012–13 season, Wade underwent left knee surgery, missing the 2012 Summer Olympics.[87][88] On December 26, 2012, playing the Charlotte Bobcats, Wade kicked guard Ramon Sessions in the groin. The following day, Wade was suspended by the NBA for one game.[89] Wade finished the 2012–2013 season with averages of 21.2 points, 5 rebounds and 5.1 assists.\n\n\nIn the playoffs, injuries limited Wade to a career-low scoring average of 15.9 points per game, but he upped his average to 19.6 points during the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. After the teams split the first two games in Miami, the Spurs took Game 3. In Game 4, Wade scored 32 points on 56 percent shooting to go with 6 steals as the Heat won 109–93. The Spurs took Game 5 despite Wade's 25 points and 10 assists. Wade scored 14 points in Miami's overtime win in Game 6, followed by 23 points and 10 rebounds in Game 7 as the Heat clinched their second straight championship and Wade's third title.[90][91]\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Wade missed 28 games from injuries and the team's decision to rest him during \"back-to-back\" games. Wade averaged 19 points and posted a career-high 54% field goal percentage. In the playoffs, the team increased Wade's minutes, highlighted by a 28-point performance in Miami's second-round victory over the Brooklyn Nets and a 23-point outing in a road victory against Indiana in the Eastern Finals. The Heat won the series in six games, advancing to their fourth straight NBA Finals. Wade averaged 19.1 points on 52 percent shooting, his best playoff percentage since 2010. The Heat lost to the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 NBA Finals in five games.\n\n\n\n#### Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade making a lay-up for the Heat in 2015\nOn June 28, 2014, Wade and teammates James and Bosh all opted out of their contracts in order to cut costs, but intended to re-sign.[92] James then announced that he was returning to Cleveland. Wade re-signed with the Heat,[93] joined by Bosh, Udonis Haslem, Chris Andersen and Mario Chalmers as well as former rivals Danny Granger and Luol Deng.\n\n\nIn the 2014–15 season, Wade missed seven consecutive games due to a hamstring injury.[94] On December 17, 2014, he scored a season-high 42 points, his highest total in almost four years, but Miami lost 105–87 to Utah.[95] He was again named an All-Star but pulled out due to another hamstring injury.[96] The Heat finished the season with a 37–45 record, as Wade missed the postseason for just the second time.\n\n\nOn June 29, 2015, Wade opted out of his contract,[97] but then signed a one-year, $20 million contract.[98] Wade hit just seven 3-point shots during the 2015–16 regular season. However, in the 2016 postseason, Wade converted on his first seven three-point shot attempts. Wade had never made more than five three-pointers in a row.[99]\n\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls (2016–2017)[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Wade joined his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls, on a two-year deal worth approximately $47 million.[100][101] Initially, the Heat offered a two-year, $20 million contract,[102] before increasing it to a two-year, $40 million offer, both of which Wade felt were unacceptable.[103][104] The relationship ended badly with Wade and the Heat squabbling.\n\n\nWade teamed with Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo in Chicago.[105] In January 2017, the trio were all fined for criticizing their young teammates' effort. In March 2017, Wade sustained a fractured elbow,[105] returning for the playoffs,[105] but the Bulls were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics in the first round.[106]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2017–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with the Cavs in 2017\nOn September 24, 2017, three months after trading Butler and waiving Rondo, the Bulls reached an agreement on a buyout with Wade.[105] Three days later, Wade signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, reuniting him with Miami Heat teammate LeBron James.[107] During the season, Wade objected to coach Tyronn Lue's plan to play him off the bench. Wade started for the Cavaliers in the first three games, but shot only 7-for-25. After a blowout loss to the Orlando Magic in the third game, Wade volunteered to take a bench role, becoming leader of the second unit.[108]\n\n\n\n### Return to Miami (2018–2019)[edit]\n\n\nOn February 8, 2018, at the NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster.[109] Acquiring guards Jordan Clarkson, George Hill and Rodney Hood, the Cavaliers[109] traded Wade back to the Miami Heat in exchange for a protected 2024 second-round draft pick.[110] At the funeral of Wade's long-time agent Henry Thomas in January, Wade mended relations with Riley. On February 9, in his first game, Wade was garnered a standing ovation and came off the bench in a 91–85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[111] On February 27, Wade scored a season-high 27 points as the Heat rallied to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 102–101. On April 3, in a 101–98 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Wade reached 5,000 assists in a Heat uniform, becoming the ninth player to score 20,000 points and collect 5,000 assists with one team, joining Karl Malone, Bryant, Jordan, James, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West.[112] On April 16, Wade scored 28 points to end the 76ers' 17-game winning streak and lead the Heat to a 113–103 Game 2 win over Philadelphia and even the first-round playoff series. He passed Larry Bird for 10th on the NBA's career postseason scoring list.[113]\n\n\nIn the off-season, Wade announced his intentions to retire after the 2018–19 season,[114][115][116] re-signing with the Heat on September 18.[117] He missed seven games in mid-November due to the birth of his daughter.[118] On November 25, Wade scored a season-high 35 points, the most ever by a Miami bench player.[119] On December 9, he scored 25 points in his 1,000th career game.[120] On January 6, 2019, Wade became the third player in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 5,000 assists, 4,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals, 800 blocks and 500 three-pointers.[121] Wade was named by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver as a special roster addition for the 2019 All-Star game, thus marking his 13th All-Star appearance.[122] Wade had received the second-most fan votes for guards in the Eastern Conference.[123] On April 9, Wade played his last home game in Miami, scoring 30 points.[124] In his final game the following night, Wade recorded his fifth career triple-double with 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.[125][126]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2020, the Heat announced that Wade's No. 3 jersey would be retired on February 22.[127]\n\n\n\n## NBA executive career[edit]\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Miami, Wade had discussed the potential for a future ownership stake in the Heat franchise but Wade was unable to commit at the time, according to Heat owner Micky Arison.[128]\n\n\nOn April 16, 2021, it was announced that Wade had purchased an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz franchise of the NBA, joining an ownership group led by his personal friend and associate, Ryan Smith, the Jazz majority owner and team governor. Wade is a member of a small ownership group that includes Smith, his wife Ashley, investor and Accel partner Ryan Sweeney, Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and the Miller family, which previously owned the team.[4]\n\n\n\n\n> \"This goes way beyond the dream I had to just play basketball in the NBA. I've seen Shaq do it in Sacramento. I've seen Grant Hill do it in Atlanta. I've seen Jordan do it in Charlotte. If this partnership is going to be anything like my relationship is with Ryan, there are going to be a lot of things that I'll want to be involved in. [...] Unfortunately, people in my community don't get this opportunity, and I do not take it lightly to have this opportunity. To make real change, this is where you have to be -- at the top -- and Ryan knows that. I'm thankful for him, and I know too that I bring a lot to this partnership outside of just my basketball knowledge and skills.\n> \n> — Dwyane Wade on purchasing an ownership stake in the Jazz[4]\n> \n\n\nWade said in the announcement of his purchase that he hoped to take a hands-on approach to his involvement, and highlighted his close brother-like relationship with Jazz star Donovan Mitchell, who he called the player most like him and \"2.0\".[4]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade shooting a free-throw against China during the 2008 Olympics\nWade was a member of the 2004 Olympic team, which won a bronze medal in Athens. The team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, in which Wade averaged 19.3 points per game.[129] The U.S. national team won a bronze medal.[130] Wade was named to the national team roster from 2006 to 2008; and, together with James and Anthony, Wade co-captained the 2006 team.[131]\n\n\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics, the United States went undefeated and captured gold medal honors after beating Spain, the 2006 World champions. Wade, who led the team in scoring, tallied a game-high 27 points in 27 minutes on 75% field goal shooting and added 4 steals, 2 assists, and 2 rebounds.[132] Wade averaged a team-high 16 points in 18 minutes on 67% field goal shooting, 4 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2.3 steals, as the U.S. lived up to their Redeem Team moniker and claimed gold medal honors for the first time since 2000.[132][133]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade's pre-game ritual consisted of doing pull-ups at the rim.\nListed at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall and weighing 220 pounds (100 kg), Wade was a shooting guard who could play point as he did during his rookie season and with smaller lineups. On offense, he was one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in NBA history. Wade's signature one-two step allowed him to dash past bigger defenders and draw fouls.[134] Wade ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. Wade was an unselfish player, averaging 5.4 assists for his career.[34] After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the league's premier clutch players.[135]\n\n\nDavid Thorpe, an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players, cited Wade's post-up game as one of his strengths.[136] Thorpe said that Wade's best moves from the post were his turnaround jump shot,[136] double pivot,[136] and what Thorpe termed a \"freeze fake\",[137] a pump fake Wade used to get his opponent to jump, so that he could drive around him.[137] Wade's main weakness was three-point shooting; he averaged 29% for his career.[34]\n\n\nWade was best known for his ability to convert difficult lay-ups, even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders.[134] His style drew concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner,[134] as Wade had hurt his knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players. Wade established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals.[138] He holds the NBA record for blocks by players listed 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and under, which he achieved in only 679 games; this is over 400 games less than the previous record-holder Dennis Johnson (1,100).[139]\n\n\nIn 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Wade as the 28th greatest player in NBA history.[140]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |

Award[142]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade at a party with then-teammates Udonis Haslem (second from left) and Antoine Walker (far right) in 2005\nWade married his high school girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches in 2002. They split in 2007, and he divorced her in 2010 after an acrimonious court battle.[143] In 2011, Wade was granted sole custody of his two children.[144][145] Wade also raises a nephew, the son of Wade's sister Deanna.[146][147] Wade began dating actress Gabrielle Union in 2008.[148][149] According to Wade, he and Union briefly split up at some point early in 2013 due to career demands.[147] During that time, Wade and Aja Metoyer conceived a child.[150][151] Wade and Union became engaged in December 2013[152] and married on August 30, 2014, in Miami.[153] On November 7, 2018, Wade became a father for the fourth time, when he and Union welcomed their daughter, who was born via surrogate.[154] In 2020, Wade's 12-year-old child came out as a transgender girl and changed her name to Zaya.[155][156][157] During an April 2023 interview, Wade said that he moved his family out of Florida partially due to the state's anti-LGBTQ policies.[158][159]\n\n\nWade's nicknames include D-Wade and Flash, which was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O'Neal who would sing, \"He's the greatest in the Universe\", in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film *Flash Gordon*.[160][161] The Heat's 2005 NBA playoffs run and Wade's performances while O'Neal was hampered by injury, led to media attention and rapid increase in Wade's popularity. During those playoffs, Wade's jersey became the league's top-selling jersey and remained so for nearly two years.[162] After the Heat's success and Wade's memorable performances during the 2006 NBA playoffs, Wade appeared on several talk shows, including *Late Show with David Letterman* and *Live with Regis and Kelly*.[163] He also made a guest star appearance on Disney Channel's *Austin & Ally* as himself, who is an obsessed fan of Austin Moon.[164]\n\n\nWade has been featured in magazine articles and publications. In 2005, he was featured on *People*'s 50 Most Beautiful People,[165] and in 2006 he was named the NBA's best-dressed player by *GQ*.[166] In 2007, *Esquire* named him to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year.[167][168] Wade's endorsement deals included Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials paired him with Charles Barkley), and Topps.[169] He had his own line of shoes with Converse named \"The Wade\" and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile.[170][171] During the 2009–10 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike's Jordan Brand.[172] Wade was chosen by Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining Anthony and Chris Paul, who had their own signature shoes. After his Jordan Brand contract expired in 2012, Wade signed with the Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning.[173] Wade was included in *Time*'s list of the 100 most influential people of 2020.[174] In April 2021, Wade became a minority owner of the Utah Jazz.[175] In October 2021, Wade's eldest son, Zaire Wade got drafted by the Salt Lake City Stars, which is the NBA G League affiliate of the Utah Jazz.\n\n\nIn March 2021, when asked about Michael Jordan, Wade stated that Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. He explained, \"I come from a Jordan era. I am biased and I'm going to be biased until the day I pass away. Michael Jordan will be my GOAT. I'm not taking anything away from LeBron. LeBron is amazing. But Michael Jordan is my GOAT.\" Wade stated that Michael Jordan was his favorite player growing up. He explained, \"For me, from Chicago, where I grew up, I made it out the hood because I seen a dude, No. 23, play the game of basketball at a level that I was like, I just want to do some of that.\"[176][177]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade is active in encouraging youth to develop their talents as seen in this talent search at the Chicago Theatre.\nWade is well known for his philanthropic involvement. In 2003, he founded The Wade's World Foundation, which provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health, and social skills for children in at-risk situations.[178] He hosts a variety of community outreach programs in Chicago and South Florida.[178] In 2008, he announced his partnership with former teammate Alonzo Mourning's charitable foundation and co-hosted ZO's Summer Groove, an annual summer event.[179][180] On December 24, 2008, Wade purchased a new home for a South Florida woman whose nephew accidentally burned down the family home.[181] In addition, Wade donated furnishings, clothing and gifts to the family.[181]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wade giving a present to a U.S. Army reservist during a 2009 pregame ceremony\nAfter breaking his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's victory to 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan who lost his hands and feet due to a bacterial infection.[182] Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia.[182] Wade is known for visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid the media spotlight.[182]\n\n\nIn September 2009, Wade donated money from his foundation to keep the Robbins, Illinois public library from having to shut down.[183] He handed library director Priscilla Coatney a $25,000 check in order to resurrect the building. In January 2010, Wade and Mourning co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti\",[184] which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three days after the fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the \"Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti\" had already raised over $800,000.[184] Wade stated, \"I expected nothing less from my friends and colleagues in the sports community, our commitment to this cause knows no bounds, and we will continue to accept any and all donations throughout the days ahead.\"[184] Wade is also an avid supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and served as an Ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative.[185]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nWade is a Christian and chose the number 3 throughout most of his career because it represents the Holy Trinity.[186][187] His mother, Jolinda, strengthened her ties to Christianity in 2001 after years of drug problems. She served as a minister during her final prison sentence in 2002 and 2003. She was ordained as a Baptist minister in January 2007 and formed the non-denominational Temple of Praise Binding and Loosing Ministry in Chicago. In May 2008, Wade purchased a church building for his mother's ministry.[188] He tithes 10% of his salary to his mother's church.[15]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Wade appeared as a role model on Season 3, Episode 13, of *Supernanny* and gave advice to the family's son.\n\n\nIn 2019, Wade appeared as a guest judge on season 14 of *America's Got Talent* alongside wife Gabrielle Union.[189]\nIn 2021, it was said that Wade will be the host of *The Cube*, which is currently aired on TBS.\n\n\n\n### 2020 tweet[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Wade tweeted in support of Nick Cannon, who was fired from ViacomCBS after making racist remarks and endorsing antisemitic conspiracy theories.[190] Following some backlash, Wade later deleted his tweet and clarified that he had expressed his support of \"[Cannon's ownership of] the content and [the] brand he helped create\", and affirmed that he has \"zero tolerance for any hate speech.\"[191]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Basketball portal\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association franchise career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff free throw scoring leaders\n* List of Olympic medalists in basketball\n* History of the Miami Heat\n* 2002–03 Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"YouTube\". *www.youtube.com*.\n2. **^** \"YouTube\". *www.youtube.com*.\n3. **^** \"Dwyane Wade Stats\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

Hardaway played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Golden State Warriors, Miami Heat, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers. He was a five-time NBA All-Star and All-NBA Team selection. Hardaway won a gold medal with the United States national basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics. He was known for his crossover dribble which was dubbed the \"UTEP two-step\" by television analysts.\n\n\nHe is the father of current NBA player Tim Hardaway Jr.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was born in Chicago, Illinois, and he graduated from Carver Area High School in 1985.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway played college basketball for the UTEP Miners under head coach Don Haskins, a future member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nHardaway was twice named MVP of El Paso's Sun Bowl Invitational Tournament, in 1987 and 1988. He played on teams that went to the NCAA Tournaments in 1988 and 1989. He won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award in 1989 as the best college player in the nation six feet (1.83 m) tall or under. While playing for the Miners, Hardaway developed his crossover dribble move that was called the \"UTEP two-step\".[2]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

In his rookie season, Hardaway wore number *5* on his jersey, as Manute Bol wore Hardaway's *10*. After Bol left the Warriors, Hardaway acquired the number. Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin formed a trio known as Run TMC (the initials of the players' first names and a play on the name of the popular rap group Run-DMC). As part of the Warriors' attack, Hardaway was responsible for leading Run TMC's fast break, displaying his excellent passing and one-on-one skills to complement Richmond's slashing and Mullin's shooting.\n\n\nGolden State made the playoffs during the 1990–91 season, Hardaway's second season and his first season in the playoffs. In the first round, the 7th seeded Warriors defeated the 2nd seeded San Antonio Spurs led by All-Star David Robinson in 4 games to advance to face the 3rd seeded Los Angeles Lakers led by NBA legend Magic Johnson. The Warriors managed to steal a game on the road in game 2, but could not defeat the more experienced Lakers, falling in five games despite Hardaway averaging 26.8 points, 12.8 assists and 3.8 steals for the series.\n\n\nHardaway averaged a career-high 23.4 points a game in the 1991–92 season, as the Warriors fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. The following season Hardaway averaged a career-high 10.6 assists a game to get with his scoring average of 21.5, but the Warriors did not make the playoffs and would not return to postseason action for the remainder of Hardaway's tenure with the team.\n\n\nAs a Warrior, Hardaway made the NBA All-Star Game three straight years, and a knee injury kept him out of the entire 1993–94 season. He reached 5,000 points and 2,500 assists faster than any other NBA player except Oscar Robertson. Hardaway played for the Warriors until the middle of 1995–96 season when he was traded to the Miami Heat along with Chris Gatling in exchange for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1996–2001)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the mid-season trade to Miami, Hardaway started 28 games to finish the season, averaging 17.2 points a game with 10 assists. Miami made the playoffs but were swept in the first round by the 72 win Chicago Bulls. The following season was a huge success for Miami and for Hardaway, as he finished 4th in voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, was selected to the All-NBA First Team as Miami won a franchise record 61 wins.\n\n\nHardaway started in 81 games, averaging 20.3 points, 8.6 assists, while placing fourth in the league with 203 three-point baskets. He also played in the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, scoring 10 points in 14 minutes. In the playoffs, Hardaway averaged 26 points a game as the Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in the first round in 5 games, and then defeated the New York Knicks in 7 games in the semifinals, in which Hardaway scored 38 points in the 7th game. Miami would once again fall to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in 5 games.\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Hardaway averaged 18.9 points and 8.3 assist per game, and was selected to play in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Heat won 55 games and won the Atlantic Division, but lost to the Knicks in 5 games in the first round of the playoffs. In the lockout shortened 1998–99 season, he averaged 17.4 points a game with 7.3 assists, and Miami won the Atlantic Division again but could once again not defeat the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs despite having home court advantage and the Knicks being the 8th seed in the playoffs.\n\n\nHardaway's production slipped in the 1999–2000 season, with Alonzo Mourning and Jamal Mashburn carrying more of the offensive load. Hardaway averaged 13.4 points with 7.4 assists a game, but shot a personal best .367 percent from beyond the three-point arc. After playing just 52 games, Hardaway was further limited in the playoffs, as Miami defeated the Detroit Pistons but once again fell to New York in 7 games.\n\n\nThat summer, Hardaway and Mourning won a gold medal playing for the U.S.A. men's basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Before the 2000–01 season Mourning would be diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, and would be sidelined for much of the season. Hardaway upped his offensive production to 14.9 points a game with 6.3 assists a game as Miami won 50 games and captured the East's third best record, only to be swept in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\n\n\n### Dallas Mavericks (2001–2002)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2000–01 season, and with his skills declining with age, Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on August 22, 2001, for a second-round draft pick. He was at one time Miami's all-time leader in assists. With Dallas, Hardaway was mainly utilized off the bench, starting only two games out of 54 and averaging almost ten points a game. In the middle of the season, he was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for point guard Nick Van Exel.\n\n\n\n### Denver Nuggets (2002)[edit]\n\n\nWith the Nuggets he started all 14 games he played with them before retiring and becoming a basketball analyst for ESPN.\n\n\nWhile playing for the Nuggets, Hardaway was suspended for two games and fined $10,000 by the league when he threw a television monitor onto the court.[3]\n\n\n\n### Indiana Pacers (2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 2003, Hardaway signed a contract with the Indiana Pacers, and in his first game registered a season-high 14 points and seven assists against the Chicago Bulls. By the end of his career, Hardaway competed in five NBA All-Star Games.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### Detroit Pistons (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 7, 2014, it was announced that Hardaway was named an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons.[4]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was the 1989 WAC Player of the Year. He recorded 5,000 points and 2,500 assists, second fastest in NBA history after Oscar Robertson. Hardaway accomplished it in 262 games; Robertson took only 247.[5] He held the record for most assists in Miami Heat franchise history with 1,947,[5] until his total was surpassed by Dwyane Wade on January 16, 2010.\n\n\nHardaway shares the record for second most steals in an NBA playoffs game, with 8 in Game 2 of the 1991 Western Conference Semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers and in Game 4 of the 1992 Western Conference First Round against the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1991–92, Hardaway became the 7th player in NBA history to average 20 points (23.4 ppg) and 10 assists (10.0 apg) in a season, a feat he accomplished again in 1992–93 (21.5 ppg, 10.6 apg).[5]\n\n\nHardaway holds the NBA record for the worst single-game shooting performance in NBA history, going 0-for-17 in a 106–102 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 27, 1991.[6] Hardaway holds the Miami Heat's all-time record in 3-point field goals made, with 806. His number 10 was retired by the Miami Heat on October 28, 2009. On April 2, 2022, Hardaway was announced as one of thirteen members to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame for the Class of 2022 later this year.[7]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was originally selected to play for \"Dream Team II\" in the 1994 FIBA World Championship but was replaced after suffering a torn knee ligament.[8]\n\n\nHe was also selected (as one of the last two players selected) for the 1998 FIBA World Championship team. The team was later replaced with CBA and college players due to the NBA lockout.[9]\n\n\nIn 2000, he played in the Sydney Olympics, scoring 5.5 points/Game and shooting .385 (15–39) from the field.[10]\n\n\nHardaway was a player/head coach of the Florida Pit Bulls of the ABA in 2006.[11][12]\n\n\nIn September 2009, he played for the NBA Generations team in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge, a series of exhibitions against Korean Basketball League and Philippine Basketball Association players.[13]\n\n\n\n## Homophobia controversy[edit]\n\n\nDuring a February 14, 2007, interview on Miami's *The Dan Le Batard Show*, in response to the coming out of former NBA player John Amaechi, Hardaway remarked that he would try to distance himself from a player he knew was homosexual. When asked by the radio show host whether he realized that his remarks were homophobic, Hardaway responded by saying: \"Well, you know I hate gay people, so I let it be known. I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States.\" He also said that if he found out he had one or more gay teammates, he would try to get them fired.[14][15]\n\n\nLater in the day, Hardaway apologized for the remarks during a telephone interview with Fox affiliate WSVN in Miami. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said I hate gay people or anything like that.\"[16] He further apologized on February 15 in a statement released by his agent.[17]\n\n\nOn the same day, the NBA responded to Hardaway's comments by removing him from its All-Star Weekend activities later that week.[17] His employer, Trinity Sports, owner of the Anderson-based CBA Indiana Alley Cats, dismissed him from his position as Chief Basketball Operations Advisor,[18] and the CBA issued a statement distancing itself from Hardaway's remarks.[19]\n\n\nIn a September 2007 interview, Hardaway spoke about his February comments, saying he \"had no idea how much I hurt people. A lot of people.\" He described the controversy as \"the biggest bump [in the road] in my life\", and added, \"I'm going to do whatever I can to correct it. That's all I can do.\"[20]\n\n\nIn an interview on February 11, 2010, on Hardcore Sports Radio on Sirius, Hardaway spoke about his recent work with The Trevor Project and The YES Institute, which he has done to educate himself on LGBT issues.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2013, when Jason Collins came out as the first active openly gay male player in a major American professional team sport, Collins said that Hardaway called him in support of his homosexuality.[21] In July 2013, Hardaway was the symbolic first signer of a petition to put a proposed amendment to the Florida State Constitution overturning Florida Amendment 2 and allowing same-sex marriage in his home state of Florida on the ballot in 2014.[22]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway and his wife Yolanda reside in Michigan. They have a son, Tim Jr., and daughters, Nia and Nina.[5][23] Tim Jr. was drafted by the New York Knicks in 2013, and currently plays for the Dallas Mavericks.[24]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989–90 | Golden State | 79 | 78 | 33.7 | .471 | .274 | .764 | 3.9 | 8.7 | 2.1 | **.2** | 14.7\n |\n| 1990–91 | Golden State | **82** | **82** | 39.2 | **.476** | **.385** | .803 | **4.0** | 9.7 | **2.6** | .1 | 22.9\n |\n| 1991–92 | Golden State | 81 | 81 | **41.1** | .461 | .338 | .766 | 3.8 | 10.0 | 2.0 | **.2** | **23.4** |\n| 1992–93 | Golden State | 66 | 66 | 39.5 | .447 | .330 | .744 | **4.0** | **10.6** | 1.8 | .**2** | 21.5\n |\n| 1994–95 | Golden State | 62 | 62 | 37.4 | .427 | .378 | .760 | 3.1 | 9.3 | 1.4 | **.2** | 20.1\n |\n| 1995–96 | Golden State | 52 | 18 | 28.6 | .421 | .366 | .769 | 2.5 | 6.9 | 1.4 | **.2** | 14.1\n |\n| 1995–96 | Miami | 28 | 28 | 37.4 | .425 | .361 | .821 | 3.5 | 10.0 | 1.0 | **.2** | 17.2\n |\n| 1996–97 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 38.7 | .415 | .344 | .799 | 3.4 | 8.6 | 1.9 | .1 | 20.3\n |\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 37.4 | .431 | .351 | .781 | 3.7 | 8.3 | 1.7 | **.2** | 18.9\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 48 | 48 | 36.9 | .400 | .360 | .812 | 3.2 | 7.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 17.4\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | 52 | 52 | 32.2 | .386 | .367 | .827 | 2.9 | 7.4 | .9 | .1 | 13.4\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 77 | 77 | 33.9 | .392 | .366 | .801 | 2.6 | 6.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 14.9\n |\n| 2001–02 | Dallas | 54 | 2 | 23.6 | .362 | .341 | **.833** | 1.8 | 3.7 | .4 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Denver | 14 | 14 | 23.2 | .373 | .373 | .632 | 1.9 | 5.5 | 1.2 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2002–03 | Indiana | 10 | 0 | 12.7 | .367 | .355 | .500 | 1.5 | 2.4 | .9 | .0 | 4.9\n |\n| Career\n | 867 | 770 | 35.3 | .431 | .355 | .782 | 3.3 | 8.2 | 1.6 | .1 | 17.7\n |\n| All-Star\n | 5 | 0 | 16.8 | .386 | .381 | .786 | 2.6 | 4.6 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 10.6\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1991 | Golden State | 9 | 9 | 44.0 | **.486** | .354 | .789 | 3.7 | **11.2** | 3.1 | **.8** | 25.2\n |\n| 1992 | Golden State | 4 | 4 | 44.0 | .400 | .345 | .649 | 3.8 | 7.3 | **3.3** | .0 | 24.5\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 36.7 | .465 | .364 | .714 | 1.7 | 5.7 | 1.0 | .0 | 17.7\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | **17** | **17** | 41.2 | .359 | .313 | **.795** | **4.1** | 7.0 | 1.6 | .1 | 18.7\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 5 | 5 | **44.4** | .447 | **.436** | .784 | 3.4 | 6.6 | 1.2 | .0 | **26.0** |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 36.4 | .268 | .200 | .625 | 2.8 | 6.4 | 1.0 | .2 | 9.0\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 7 | 7 | 26.0 | .294 | .206 | .700 | 2.1 | 4.7 | .7 | .0 | 7.7\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 2 | 2 | 18.0 | .222 | .333 | .000 | 1.0 | 4.5 | .0 | .0 | 2.5\n |\n| 2003 | Indiana | 4 | 0 | 11.8 | .333 | .300 | .000 | .5 | 2.3 | .3 | .0 | 3.3\n |\n| Career\n | 56 | 52 | 36.6 | .393 | .320 | .751 | 3.1 | 6.8 | 1.6 | .2 | 16.8\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Tim Hardaway Stats\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

He is a 7-foot-1-inch (2.16 m) and 325-pound (147 kg) center who played for six teams over his 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is a four-time NBA champion. O'Neal is regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nAfter playing college basketball for the LSU Tigers, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid a feud between O'Neal and his teammate Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.[6] O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.[7]\n\n\nO'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award; the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award; 15 All-Star Game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards; three Finals MVP awards; two scoring titles; 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 8th all-time in points scored, 6th in field goals, 15th in rebounds, and 8th in blocks. O'Neal was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996.[8] Due to his ability to dunk the basketball and score from close range, O'Neal also ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%) and led the league in field goal percentage ten times.[9] O'Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.[10] He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017.[11] In October 2021, O'Neal was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[12]\n\n\nIn addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, *Shaq Diesel*, going platinum. O'Neal is also an electronic music producer, and touring DJ, known as DIESEL.[13] He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, *Shaq's Big Challenge* and *Shaq Vs.* He hosts *The Big Podcast with Shaq*.[14] He was a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings from 2013 to 2022 and is the general manager of Kings Guard Gaming of the NBA 2K League.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal playing for the Cole High School varsity basketball team in 1988–89\nO'Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey,[16] to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school basketball (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall. Toney struggled with drug addiction and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's Jamaican stepfather, Phillip Arthur Harrison, a career Army sergeant.[17][18] O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship.[18] On his 1994 rap album, *Shaq Fu: The Return*, O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song \"Biological Didn't Bother\", dismissing him with the line \"Phil is my father.\" However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O'Neal telling him, \"I don't hate you. I had a good life. I had Phil.\"[19]\n\n\nO'Neal came from a tall family. His father and mother were 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall, respectively, and by age 13, O'Neal was already 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall. He credited the Boys & Girls Clubs of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. \"It gave me something to do,\" he said. \"I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team.\"[20] Because of his stepfather's career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to military bases in Germany and Texas.[21]\n\n\nAfter returning from Germany, O'Neal's family settled in San Antonio, Texas. By age 16, O'Neal had grown to 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), and he began playing basketball at Robert G. Cole High School. He led his team to a 68–1 record over two years and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year.[22] His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification.[23] O'Neal's tendency to make hook shots earned comparisons to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, inspiring him to wear the same jersey number as Abdul-Jabbar, No. 33. However, his high school team did not have a *33* jersey, so O'Neal chose to wear No. 32 before college.[24]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school, O'Neal studied business at Louisiana State University (LSU). He had first met Tigers coach Dale Brown years earlier in Europe when O'Neal's stepfather was stationed on a U.S. Army base at Wildflecken, West Germany. While playing for Brown at LSU, O'Neal was a two-time All-American, two-time SEC Player of the Year, and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991; he was also named college player of the year by AP and UPI. O'Neal left LSU early to pursue his NBA career, but continued his education even after becoming a professional player.[25] He was later inducted into the LSU Hall of Fame.[26] A 900-pound (410 kg) bronze statue of O'Neal is located in front of the LSU Basketball Practice Facility.[27]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (1992–1996)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (1992–1993)[edit]\n\n\nThe Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. In the summer before moving to Orlando, he spent time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson.[28] O'Neal wore number 32 because Terry Catledge refused to relinquish the 33 jersey.[24] O'Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA, the first player to do so.[29] During his rookie season, O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season. He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985.[30] The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season, but missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers. On more than one occasion during the year, *Sports Illustrated* writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying, \"We've got to get [head coach] Matty [Guokas] out of here and bring in [assistant] Brian [Hill].\"[31]\n\n\n\n#### First playoff appearance (1993–1994)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993–1994, O'Neal's second season, Hill was the coach and Guokas was reassigned to the front office.[32] O'Neal improved his scoring average to 29.4 points (second in the league to David Robinson) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at 60%. On November 20, 1993, against the New Jersey Nets, O'Neal registered the first triple-double of his career, recording 24 points to go along with career highs of 28 rebounds and 15 blocks.[33] He was voted into the All-Star game and also made the All-NBA 3rd Team. Teamed with newly drafted Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway, the Magic finished with a record of 50–32 and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.[34] In his first playoff series, O'Neal averaged 20.7 points and 13.3 rebounds[35][*unreliable source*] as the Pacers swept the Magic.[36][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n#### First scoring title and NBA Finals (1994–1996)[edit]\n\n\nIn O'Neal's third season, 1994–95, he led the NBA in scoring with a 29.3 point average, while finishing second in MVP voting to David Robinson and entering his third straight All-Star Game along with Hardaway. They formed one of the league's top duos and helped Orlando to a 57–25 record and the Atlantic Division crown. The Magic won their first-ever playoff series against the Boston Celtics in the 1995 NBA Playoffs. They then defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinals. After beating Reggie Miller's Indiana Pacers, the Magic reached the NBA Finals, facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. O'Neal played well in his first Finals appearance, averaging 28 points on 59.5% shooting, 12.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists. Despite this, the Rockets, led by future Hall-of-Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, swept the series in four games.[37]\n\n\nO'Neal was injured for a great deal of the 1995–96 season, missing 28 games. He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game, made the All-NBA 3rd Team, and played in his 4th All-Star Game. Despite O'Neal's injuries, the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60–22, second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls, who finished with an NBA record 72 wins. Orlando easily defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the 1996 NBA Playoffs; however, they were no match for Jordan's Bulls, who swept them in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004)[edit]\n\n\n#### O'Neal–Bryant tandem buildup (1996–1999)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 8 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004), O'Neal won three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 and appeared in the 2004 NBA Finals.\nO'Neal became a free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the *Orlando Sentinel* published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning.[38][39] 82% answered \"no\".[38] O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill.[40][41] He said the team \"just didn't respect [Hill]\".[42] Another question in the poll asked whether O'Neal was worth $115 million, in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer; 91.3% of the response said it was not.[39][40] O'Neal's Olympic teammates teased him over the poll.[39][41] He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry.[38] O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to \"feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond\".[43] He also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him.[44]\n\n\nOn the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, the media announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121 million contract.[45][46] O'Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\"[47][48] The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season.[49] O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games.[50] In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The *Los Angeles Daily News* reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: \"It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.\"[51]\n\n\nThe following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61–21, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4–0 sweep.[52]\n\n\nWith the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar Kobe Bryant, expectations for the Lakers increased; however, personnel changes were a source of instability during the 1998–99 season. Long-time Laker point guard Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets; his former backcourt partner Eddie Jones was packaged with back-up center Elden Campbell for Glen Rice to satisfy a demand by O'Neal for a shooter. Coach Del Harris was fired, and former Lakers forward Kurt Rambis finished the season as head coach. The Lakers finished with a 31–19 record during the lockout-shortened season. Although they made the playoffs, they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs. The Spurs would go on to win their first NBA title in 1999.\n\n\n\n#### MVP and championship seasons (1999–2002)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal during Game 5 of the 2000 NBA Finals\nIn 1999, prior to the 1999–2000 season, the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach, and the team's fortunes soon changed. Jackson immediately challenged O'Neal, telling him \"the [NBA's] MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired.\"[53]\n\n\nIn the November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.[54] On March 6, 2000, O'Neal's 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123–103 win over the LA Clippers.[55] O'Neal's 61-point game is the most recent game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer.[56]\n\n\nO'Neal was also voted the 1999–2000 regular season Most Valuable Player, one vote short of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Fred Hickman, then of CNN, instead chose Allen Iverson, then of the Philadelphia 76ers who would go on to win MVP the next season. O'Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots. Jackson's influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O'Neal to defense, resulting in his first All-Defensive Team selection (second-team) in 2000.[57]\n\n\nIn the 2001 NBA Finals against the 76ers, O'Neal fouled out in Game 3 backing over Dikembe Mutombo, the 2000–2001 Defensive Player of the Year. \"I didn't think the best defensive player in the game would be flopping like that. It's a shame that the referees buy into that\", O'Neal said. \"I wish he'd stand up and play me like a man instead of flopping and crying every time I back him down.[58]\n\n\nA month before the 2001–02 season's training camp, O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot.[59] He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker.[60] He was ready for the start of the 2001–02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him.[59]\n\n\nIn January 2002, he was involved in a spectacular on-court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls. He punched center Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket, resulting in a melee with Miller, forward Charles Oakley, and several other players.[61] O'Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000.[62] For the season, O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, excellent statistics but below his career average; he was less of a defensive force during the season.[59]\n\n\nMatched up against the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 Western Conference finals, O'Neal said, \"There is only one way to beat us. It starts with c and ends with t.\" O'Neal meant \"cheat\" in reference to the alleged flopping of Kings' center Vlade Divac. O'Neal referred to Divac as \"she\", and said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul. \"I'm a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work.\"[63] \nAfter the 2001–2002 season, O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.[59]\n\n\nUsing Jackson's triangle offense, O'Neal and Bryant enjoyed tremendous success, leading the Lakers to three consecutive titles (2000, 2001, and 2002). O'Neal was named MVP of the NBA Finals all three times and had the highest scoring average for a center in NBA Finals history.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Toe surgery to departure (2002–2004)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal missed the first 12 games of the 2002–03 season recovering from toe surgery.[65] He was sidelined with hallux rigidus, a degenerative arthritis in his toe.[66] He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained, \"I got hurt on company time, so I'll heal on company time.\"[67] O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure.[66] The Lakers started the season with a record of 11–19.[68] At the end of the season, the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003.\n\n\nFor the 2003–04 season, the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of two aging stars—forward Karl Malone and guard Gary Payton—but due to salary cap restrictions, could not offer either player nearly as much money as he could have made with some other teams. O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season, O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. During a preseason game, O'Neal had yelled at Lakers owner Jerry Buss, \"Pay me.\"[69] There had been increasing tension between O'Neal and Bryant. The feud climaxed during training camp prior to the 2003–2004 season when Bryant, in an interview with ESPN journalist Jim Gray, criticized O'Neal for being out of shape, a poor leader, and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the team.[70]\n\n\nThe Lakers made the playoffs in 2004 and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter said, \"Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He's always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding\".[71] After the series, O'Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak regarding O'Neal's future with the club, as well as by the departure of Lakers coach Phil Jackson at the request of Buss. O'Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team's decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns, and O'Neal promptly demanded a trade. Kupchak wanted the Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki in return but Mavericks owner Mark Cuban refused to let his 7-footer go. However, Miami showed interest, and eventually the two clubs agreed on a trade.[72] Winter said, \"[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much.\"[73]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2004–2008)[edit]\n\n\n#### MVP runner-up (2004–2005)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Miami in 2007\nOn July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, and a future first-round draft choice (the Lakers used the draft choice to select Jordan Farmar in the 2006 draft). O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star Dwyane Wade, to whom he gave the nickname \"Flash\". With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. O'Neal made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference Player of the Month award for his performance in March. O'Neal also narrowly lost the 2004–05 MVP Award to Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash in one of the closest votes in NBA history.[74]\n\n\nDespite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference Finals and a Game 7 against the defending champion Detroit Pistons, losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O'Neal.[75] \nIn August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100 million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20 million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth championship (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\nIn the second game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities.[67] O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a \"frontrunner\" and a \"master of panic.\"[77] Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview \"Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game.\"[78] During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a .500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.[79]\n\n\n\nOn April 11, 2006, O'Neal recorded his second career triple-double against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists.[80] O'Neal finished the 2005–06 season as the league leader in field goal percentage.[80]\n\n![](image)O'Neal holding the championship ball when the NBA Champion Heat visited the White House\nIn the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2–0 lead in the series. Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3–1 series lead. The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat \nheld on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first-ever NBA Finals.[81]\n\n\nIn the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks led by Dirk Nowitzki, and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion. The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title. With Wade carrying the offensive load, O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Surgery and Wade's injury (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, O'Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery.[82][83] After one of those missed games, a Christmas Day match-up against the Lakers, he ripped Jackson, who O'Neal had once called a second father, referring to his former coach as \"Benedict Arnold\". Jackson had previously said, \"The only person I've ever [coached] that hasn't been a worker... is probably Shaq.\"[84] The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence,[85] but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team.[85] Critics doubted that O'Neal, now in his mid-30s, could carry the team into the playoffs.[86] The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.[85]\n\n\nIn a rematch of the year before, the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006–07 NBA playoffs. The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round.[87] It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006–07 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Career lows and disagreements (2007–2008)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007–08 season, averaging career lows in points, rebounds, and blocks. His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O'Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season.[9] O'Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15–game losing streak.[88] According to O'Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury.[89] During a practice in February 2008, O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal.[90] O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not \"all that good\" by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.[91]\n\n\nO'Neal played 33 games for the Miami Heat in the 2007–08 season prior to being traded to the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal started all 33 games and averaged 14.2 points per game. Following the trade to Phoenix, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points while starting all 28 games with the Suns.\n\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns (2008–2009)[edit]\n\n\nThe Phoenix Suns acquired O'Neal in February 2008 from the league-worst Miami Heat, who had a record at the time of the trade of 9–37, in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[92] O'Neal made his Suns debut on February 20, 2008, against his former Lakers team, scoring 15 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in the process. The Lakers won, 130–124. O'Neal was upbeat in a post-game press conference, stating: \"I will take the blame for this loss because I wasn't in tune with the guys [...] But give me four or five days to really get in tune and I'll get it.\"[93]\n\n\nIn 28 regular season games, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points and 10.6 rebounds,[94] good enough to make the playoffs. One of the reasons for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, especially after the Suns' six-game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs.[95] O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, but they were once again eliminated, in five games. O'Neal averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.[94]\n\n\nO'Neal preferred his new situation with the Suns over the Heat. \"I love playing for this coach and I love playing with these guys\", O'Neal said. \"We have professionals who know what to do. No one is asking me to play with [his former Heat teammates] Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis. I'm actually on a team again.\" Riley felt O'Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates. O'Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley, whom he often referred to as the \"great Pat Riley\" while playing for the Heat.[96] O'Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career.[97] They connected his arthritic toe, which would not bend, to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg. The trainers had him concentrate on building his core strength, flexibility, and balance.[98]\n\n\nThe 2008–09 season improved for O'Neal, who averaged 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks through the first half (41 games) of the season, leading the Suns to a 23–18 record and 2nd place in their division.[99] He returned to the All-Star Game in 2009 and emerged as co-MVP along with ex-teammate Kobe Bryant.\n\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Phoenix teammate Steve Nash\nOn February 27, 2009, O'Neal scored 45 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, his 49th career 40-point game, beating the Toronto Raptors 133–113.\n\n\nIn a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. \"I'm really too old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds\", O'Neal said, referring to the then 23-year-old Howard. \"It's not really my role anymore.\" O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. \"I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool\", said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was \"very disappointed cause [O'Neal] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.\"[100] O'Neal responded, \"Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching.\"[101] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since \"everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back.\"[102] In a 2006 interview in *TIME*, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would \"Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass.\"[103]\n\n\nOn March 6, O'Neal talked about the upcoming game against the Rockets and Yao Ming. \"It's not going to be man-on-man, so don't even try that,\" says O'Neal with an incredulous laugh. \"They're going to double and triple me like everybody else ... I rarely get to play [Yao] one-on-one ... But when I play him (on defense), it's just going to be me down there. So don't try to make it a Yao versus Shaq thing, when it's Shaq versus four other guys.\"[104]\n\n\nThe 2009 NBA Playoffs was also the first time since O'Neal's rookie season in 1992–93 that he did not participate in the playoffs. He was named as a member of the All-NBA Third Team. The Suns notified O'Neal he might be traded to cut costs.[105]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, 2009, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Sasha Pavlovic, Ben Wallace, $500,000, and a 2010 second-round draft pick.[106] Upon arriving in Cleveland, O'Neal said, \"My motto is very simple: Win a Ring for the King\", referring to LeBron James.[107] James was the leader of the team, and O'Neal deferred to him.[108] On February 25, 2010, O'Neal suffered a severe right thumb injury while attempting to go up for a shot against Glen Davis of the Boston Celtics.[109] He had surgery on the thumb on March 1 and returned to play in time for the first round of the playoffs.[110] After defeating the Chicago Bulls in the first round, the Cavaliers went on to lose to the Boston Celtics in the second round. In September 2016, O'Neal said: \"When I was in Cleveland, we were in first place. Big Baby [Glen Davis] breaks my hand and I had to sit out five weeks late in the year. I come back finally in the first round of the playoffs, and we lost to Boston in the second round. I was upset. I know for a fact if I was healthy, we would have gotten it done that year and won a ring.\"[111] O'Neal averaged career lows in almost every major statistical category during the 2009–10 season, taking on a much less significant role than in previous years.\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal finished his career with the Boston Celtics.\nUpon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O'Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Celtics, saw an opportunity to acquire O'Neal.[112] Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O'Neal would not receive preferential treatment, nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami.[113] On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal.[114] The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8 million.[115] O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal.[116] The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands.[117][118] He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.[119]\n\n\nO'Neal said he did not \"compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe.\" O'Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan: \"If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that.\"[120] Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected to be part of the second unit.[120] Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself.[121] O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg[122] including knee,[123] calf,[124] hip,[125] and Achilles injuries.[126] The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,[122] and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[127] After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf.[122][128] It was the last regular season game he would play that year.[129] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.[130][131]\n\n\nOn June 1, 2011, O'Neal announced his retirement via social media.[132][133] On a short video on Twitter, O'Neal tweeted, \"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.\" On June 3, 2011, O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement.[134]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nWhile in college, O'Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner.[135] His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament. While he led the Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup.\n\n\nHe was one of two players (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.[136]\n\n\nAfter his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition. He was angered by being overlooked for the 1999 FIBA AmeriCup squad, saying it was a \"lack of respect\".[137] He forwent an opportunity to participate in the 2000 Olympics, explaining that two gold medals were enough.[138] O'Neal also chose not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[139] He rejected an offer to play in the 2004 Olympics,[140] and although he was initially interested in being named for 2006–2008 US preliminary roster,[141] he eventually declined the invitation.[142]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal's free throw shooting was regarded as one of his major weaknesses.\nO'Neal established himself as an overpowering low post presence, putting up career averages of 23.7 points on .582 field goal accuracy, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game.\n\n\nAt 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m), 330 lb (150 kg)[143] and U.S. shoe size 23,[65] he became famous for his physical stature. His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents. On two occasions during his first season in the NBA, his powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports, prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.[144]\n\n\nO'Neal's \"drop step\", (called the \"Black Tornado\" by O'Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage slam dunk, proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time.[145] He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of nine.[65]\n\n\nOpposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[146]\n\n\nO'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.[147] O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80 percent in practice.[148] In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as \"Hack-a-Shaq\". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,[149] having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.[150]\n\n\nO'Neal only made one three-point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three-point-shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).\n\n\nO'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.[151]\n\n\nPhil Jackson believed O'Neal underachieved in his career, saying he \"could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons.\"[152] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named O'Neal as the 8th greatest player in NBA history.[153]\n\n\nThe Lakers retired his No. 34 jersey on April 2, 2013.[154] On February 26, 2016, the Miami Heat announced that it would retire O'Neal's No. 32 jersey during the 2016–17 season, making O'Neal one of just 32 athletes in American professional sports history to have their jersey retired by multiple teams.[155][156] The Heat eventually retired his jersey on December 22, 2016, during halftime of a game against his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n### Media personality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal in 1998\nO'Neal called himself \"The Big Aristotle\" and \"Hobo Master\" for his composure and insights during interviews. Journalists and others gave O'Neal several nicknames, including \"Shaq\", \"The Diesel\", \"Shaq Fu\", \"The Big Daddy\", \"Superman\", \"The Big Agave\", \"The Big Cactus\", \"The Big Shaqtus\", \"The Big Galactus\", \"Wilt Chamberneezy\", \"The Big Baryshnikov\", \"The Real Deal\", \"The Big Shamrock\", \"The Big Leprechaun\", \"Shaqovic\",[157][158] and \"The Big Conductor\".[159] Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press, O'Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking.[160] When he did not want to speak with the press, he employed an interview technique whereby, sitting in front of his cubicle, he would murmur in his low-pitched voice.[160][161]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike, O'Neal performed in a commercial for Disney. O'Neal was fined by the union for crossing the picket line.[162][163]\n\n\nO'Neal's humorous and sometimes incendiary comments fueled the Los Angeles Lakers' long-standing rivalry with the Sacramento Kings; O'Neal frequently referred to the Sacramento team as the \"Queens\".[164][165][166] During the 2002 victory parade, O'Neal declared that Sacramento would never be the capital of California,[167] after the Lakers beat the Kings in a tough seven-game series en route to its third championship with O'Neal.\n\n\nHe also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O'Neal told a reporter, \"you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so.\"[168] O'Neal later said it was locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but he said many Asians wouldn't see the humor.[169] Yao joked, \"Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with it when I was little.\"[170] O'Neal later expressed regret for the way he treated Yao early in his career.[171]\n\n\nDuring the 2005 NBA playoffs, O'Neal compared his poor play to Erick Dampier,[172] a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games. The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult. The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals.[173]\n\n\nO'Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, he responded, \"I'm sorry, who?\" and continued to pretend that he did not know who Bryant was until well into the 2005–06 season.[174]\n\n\nO'Neal also appeared on television on *Saturday Night Live* (he was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by Kelsey Grammer; however, he did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted *Shaq's Big Challenge*, a reality show on ABC in which he challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape.\n\n\nWhen the Lakers faced the Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify the end of the so-called \"Bryant–O'Neal feud\" that had festered since O'Neal left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend Bill Russell to make peace with Bryant.[175] On June 22, 2008, O'Neal freestyled a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O'Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a vasectomy, as part of a rhyme. He also taunted Bryant for not being able to win a championship without him. O'Neal led the audience to mockingly chant several times \"Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes\".[176] O'Neal justified his act by saying \"I was freestyling. That's all. It was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever. That is what MCs do. They freestyle when called upon. I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all.\"[177] Although even other exponents of hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg, Nas and Cory Gunz, agreed with O'Neal,[178] Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his intention to relieve O'Neal of his Maricopa County sheriff posse badge, due to \"use of a racially derogatory word and other foul language\".

Following his college basketball career at Georgetown University, his tenacity on defense twice earned him the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and twice placed him on the NBA All-Defensive Team. Mourning made a comeback after undergoing a kidney transplant and later won the 2006 NBA championship with the Heat. Mourning also played for the Charlotte Hornets and New Jersey Nets. On March 30, 2009, Mourning became the first Miami Heat player to have his number retired.[3] In 2010, Mourning was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In August 2014, Mourning was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and in August 2019 he was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDuring his time at Indian River High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, he led the team to 51 straight victories and a state title his junior year (1987). As a senior, he averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and 12 blocked shots per game. He was named Player of the Year by USA Today, Parade, Gatorade, and Naismith. He was the #1 recruit of the 1988 class, over Christian Laettner, Shawn Kemp, Billy Owens, Kenny Williams, Stanley Roberts, Rick Fox, and Malik Sealy, among others.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nMourning played college basketball for John Thompson at Georgetown University. He made an immediate impact as a freshman, starting all 34 games for the Hoyas, averaging 13.1 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. But his most notable accomplishment was leading the nation in total blocked shots (169) and blocks per game (5.0); both figures led the nation and set NCAA records for a freshman at that time.\n\n\nMourning's scoring and rebounding improved over the next two seasons, but his shot-blocking declined significantly, as his taller teammate Dikembe Mutombo established himself as starting center for Georgetown, forcing Mourning to play at power forward. After Mutombo entered the NBA draft in 1991, Mourning re-took his place as starting center, and responded with a spectacular senior season in 1991–92. He averaged 21.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 5.0 blocks per game that year, and collected numerous awards, including Consensus First-Team All-American and Big East Conference Player of the Year. He was also named Big East Defensive Player of the Year, which he had won twice previously (as a freshman in 1988–89, and again as a sophomore in 1989–90, sharing the award with Mutombo that season; Mutombo won the award alone in 1990–91).\n\n\nMourning finished his college career with 2,001 points and 1,032 rebounds, reaching the exclusive 2,000-point and 1,000-rebound milestone. More impressively, he finished with 453 blocked shots in his college career, ranking first all-time in NCAA history at that time. Interestingly, Mourning was never listed as the all-time leader in Georgetown history, as the school credits Patrick Ewing with 493 blocks during his college career,[4] but blocked shots were not an official NCAA statistic at that time.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Charlotte Hornets (1992–1995)[edit]\n\n\nMourning was selected second overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, behind Shaquille O'Neal and before Christian Laettner.[5] Mourning was named to the league's all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks. He finished second to Shaquille O'Neal in rookie of the year voting.[6] He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since David Robinson in the 1989–90 season to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104–103 victory in the game and a 3–1 victory in the series. The Hornets lost in the second round to the New York Knicks in five games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in nine playoff games. The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.\n\n\nIn the 1994–95 season, Mourning and teammate Larry Johnson led the Hornets to a 50-win season and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in scoring (21.3 per game), rebounding (9.9 per game), blocked shots (2.92 per game), and field goal percentage (.519), and played in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1995–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn November 3, 1995, after Mourning rejected Charlotte's contract extension offer worth an average of $11.2 million for seven years and knowing they would not be able to re-sign him, the Hornets traded him, along with reserves Pete Myers and LeRon Ellis in exchange for Glen Rice, Matt Geiger, Khalid Reeves and a first-round pick in the 1996 NBA draft.[7]\n\n\nMourning would immediately serve as the centerpiece of the Pat Riley-coached Heat, and in his first season in Miami he averaged 23.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game as Miami made the playoffs before being swept in the first round by the 72-win Bulls. Mourning played in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game and was joined by All-Star point guard Tim Hardaway who arrived through a mid-season trade.\n\n\nIn July 1996, Mourning signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Heat.[8] In the 1996–97 season, the Heat would go on to win a then franchise-record 61 games, finishing second in the Eastern Conference behind the defending champions Bulls, while Mourning averaged 19.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the Orlando Magic in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where the rivalry between the Heat and the New York Knicks intensified. The Knicks took a 3–1 series lead, but following a brawl between Charlie Ward and P. J. Brown late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down. Mourning scored 28 points in Game 6, followed by a 22-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 to help Miami advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, a franchise first, to face Chicago. The Bulls took a 3–0 series lead, and Mourning guaranteed a victory in Game 4 as the Heat won 87–80.[9] However, with a 100–87 loss in Game 5, the Heat were eliminated by the Bulls.\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Mourning played 58 games and averaged 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game as the Heat won 55 games. However, Miami lost in the first round to the Knicks, with Mourning missing the deciding Game 5 due to a suspension caused by a fight between Mourning and former teammate Larry Johnson in Game 4.[10] The brawl also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was seen dangling on Mourning's leg in an attempt to break up the fight.[11] The following season, the Heat won 31 games in a lockout-shortened 50-game schedule, and Mourning won his first of two consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards after leading the league in blocks with 3.9 per game. Despite finishing with the best record in the Eastern Conference, the Heat once again fell short to the Knicks in the first round, with Allan Houston securing the series victory with a last-second jumper in Game 5.[12][13] Mourning again led the NBA in blocks in the 1999–2000 season, this time with a 3.7 average, and won Defensive Player of the Year. Miami finished the regular season with 52 wins and faced the Knicks in the second round. But for a third straight season, the Heat lost to the Knicks in a winner-take-all game, this time in Game 7.[14]\n\n\nShortly after playing for the gold medal-winning U.S. national team in the 2000 Summer Olympics, Mourning was diagnosed with a serious kidney disease.[15] Initially deemed out for the remainder of the season, Mourning returned for the final 13 games, helping the Heat win 50 games despite playing limited minutes. However, Miami was swept 3–0 in the first round by the Hornets.[16] In the 2001–02 season, Mourning played 75 games and averaged 15.7 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game, earning his final All-Star nod. Despite that, the Heat missed the playoffs with a 36–46 record. Mourning missed the entire 2002–03 season as he continued to deal with a serious kidney disorder, and without their star center, the Heat won only 25 games and missed the playoffs again.[17]\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nMourning signed a four-year deal with the New Jersey Nets in July 2003 as a free agent.[18][19] On November 24, 2003, after appearing in 12 games, Mourning retired from the NBA due to complications from his kidney disease.[20][21] On December 19, he underwent a successful kidney transplant.[22] In 2004, he started practicing with the Nets again, and made the team's regular season roster during the 2004–05 season. He did not play a significant role with the Nets, however, and openly complained to the media that he wanted out of New Jersey, especially after the team traded away Kenyon Martin.[23][24] After playing in just 30 total games for New Jersey, Mourning, Eric Williams and Aaron Williams were traded to the Toronto Raptors for Vince Carter on December 17, 2004.[25][26] Mourning never reported to the Raptors, and was bought out of his contract at a remaining $9 million on February 11, 2005. Raptors team officials later said that he did not meet the medical conditions to play for the team.[27][28][29] Mourning then finished the season with the Heat being paid a second salary, the veteran's minimum.[30]\n\n\n\n### Return to the Heat (2005–2008)[edit]\n\n\nMourning re-signed with the Heat on March 1, 2005.[31] His role was reduced as a backup because of superstar Shaquille O'Neal, although he was called upon as a starter due to O'Neal missing stretches due to injury. O'Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning's tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the first seed in Eastern Conference during the 2004–05 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest. Miami swept the Nets in the first round of the playoffs, with Mourning recording 21 points and nine rebounds in just 16 minutes in Game 2. In the second round against the Washington Wizards, Mourning stepped in for the injured O'Neal and scored 14 points with 13 rebounds and blocked four shots in Game 3 as Miami completed another four-game sweep. Miami fell in seven games to the defending champions, the Detroit Pistons, in the Eastern Conference Finals, with Mourning leading the team in blocks with three per game for the series.\n\n\nOn June 17, 2005, the Heat picked up the team option on Mourning,[32] as the Heat once again overhauled their roster, acquiring other veterans seeking a title such as Antoine Walker and Gary Payton.[33][34] Mourning continued to serve as the Heat's backup center, and early on stepped in to serve as the team's starting center after O'Neal suffered an injury. Mourning started in 20 games out of a total of 65 games played, averaging 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds, while finishing third in the league with 2.7 blocks per game despite playing as a reserve. In the playoffs, Mourning continued to shine in his role as a defensive player off the bench, as Miami advanced past the Bulls and the Nets before defeating the Pistons in six games to advance to the 2006 NBA Finals, the first NBA Finals in franchise history and the first for Mourning. After a 2–0 deficit, Miami won all three of its home games led by the spectacular play of Dwyane Wade, and in Game 6 in Dallas, Mourning came off the bench to score eight points with six rebounds and a team-high five blocks to help Miami win its first NBA championship in franchise history.\n\n\nAfter winning the championship, Mourning announced that he would return to the Heat in the 2006–07 season to defend their title, despite receiving offers of more money from other teams, including the San Antonio Spurs.[35] In 2007, Mourning announced he would return for one more year with the Heat and his 15th season. \"It will definitely be my last year\", Mourning said.[36] After starting the season on a solid note averaging 6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.75 blocks in just over 16 minutes played per 24 games,[37] Mourning tore his patellar tendon in his right knee[38] on December 19, 2007, during the first quarter of the 117–111 overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[39][40]\n\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, he became the Heat's all-time leader in points scored (which has since been surpassed by Dwyane Wade).[41]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nMourning announced his retirement from the NBA on January 22, 2009. In his press conference he said, \"At 38 I feel like I've physically done all I can for this game.\"[42][43] One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning's number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored.[3] The jersey retirement ceremony occurred on March 30, 2009, when the Heat hosted the Orlando Magic. During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor Charlie Crist; former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson; Basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing; Heat players Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem; and Heat head coach Pat Riley.[44][45]\n\n\nIn May 2009, he was named to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches, and administrators who contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia. In the following April, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding high school, collegiate, and professional career as well as his commitment to volunteer service in the communities in which he has lived and worked throughout his life.[46]\n\n\nMourning announced his return to the Heat in late June 2009; he holds the position of vice president of player programs and development, which covers community outreach and mentoring young players.[47]\n\n\nMourning played in a basketball game for Barack Obama's 50th birthday at the basketball court at the White House in 2011. In addition to Mourning, the game featured Shane Battier, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Maya Moore, Joakim Noah, Chris Paul and Derrick Rose and Obama's friends from high school. Kobe Bryant and Bill Russell were spectators.[48]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2014, it was announced that Mourning would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 8.[49][50][51]\n\n\nOn March 26, 2019, Mourning was named to the FIBA Hall of Fame,[52] and was inducted on August 30.[53][54]\n\n\nIn 2021, to commemorate the NBA's 75th anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all-time, and named Mourning as the 69th greatest player in NBA history.[55]\n\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* 3-time NBA champion: 2006 (as a player), 2012, 2013 (as vice president of player programs)\n* 7-time NBA All-Star: 1994–1997, 2000–2002\n* All-NBA First Team: 1999\n* All-NBA Second Team: 2000\n* 2-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year: 1999, 2000\n* 2-time NBA All-Defensive First Team: 1999, 2000\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team: 1993\n* J.

Funds are allocated toward research for a cure, education for doctors and the general public, testing for early detection and a fund for those not able to afford medication.\n\n\nIn 2007, Mourning along with Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, and Cal Ripken Jr. founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.[58]\n\n\nIn 2003, he also founded the Overtown Youth Center for underprivileged kids, located in Miami, Florida. The program aims to inspire, empower, and enrich these children while teaching them to become positive contributing citizens.\n\n\nIn 2009, the Miami-Dade school board named a new high school in North Miami, Florida, in his honor, Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMourning and his ex-wife Tracy have three children.[59] Like his father, his oldest son, Trey Mourning played for the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team, wearing his father's signature number 33 jersey. They resided in Pinecrest, Florida, where Mourning purchased a two-story, 9,786-square-foot residence for $4.5 million in 2012.[60] On June 26, 2019, Trey was included on the Miami Heat roster for the 2019 NBA Summer League,[61] and was later selected second overall by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA G League in the 2019 NBA G League draft.[62]\n\n\nIn July 2011, Mourning was sued by Miami-based lawyer Spencer Aronfeld on behalf of Alberto Candoleria for crashing his car into another car and then leaving the scene of the accident. The Florida Highway Patrol later charged Mourning with leaving the scene of a car accident. The accident allegedly occurred after he left Chris Bosh's wedding in Miami Beach after 3:00 a.m. Candoleria had just been in an accident when Mourning struck his car.[63][64][65]\n\n\nIn 2015, Mourning was one of eight Virginians honored in the Library of Virginia's \"Strong Men & Women in Virginia History\" for his charitable work and for his contributions to the sport of basketball.[66]\n\n\n\n### Kidney transplant[edit]\n\n\nOn November 25, 2003, Mourning's cousin and a retired U. S. Marine, Jason Cooper, was visiting Mourning's gravely ill grandmother in the hospital. Mourning's father was present and informed Cooper that Mourning was retiring that day from the NBA because of a life-threatening kidney disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the same problem that Sean Elliott had in 1999. Cooper asked if there was anything he could do, and began to contemplate donating one of his kidneys to his estranged cousin, whom he had not seen in 25 years and whom he only knew through basketball. Cooper was tested for compatibility, along with many other family members and friends (including fellow NBA center and good friend Patrick Ewing); during his grandmother's funeral, Mourning received the news that Jason Cooper was a match.[67][68]\n\n\nMourning received Cooper's left kidney on December 19, 2003.[66][68]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992–93 | Charlotte | 78 | **78** | 33.9 | .511 | .000 | .781 | 10.3 | 1.0 | .3 | 3.5 | 21.0\n |\n| 1993–94 | Charlotte | 60 | 59 | 33.6 | .505 | .000 | .762 | 10.2 | 1.4 | .5 | 3.1 | 21.5\n |\n| 1994–95 | Charlotte | 77 | 77 | **38.2** | .519 | .324 | .761 | 9.9 | 1.4 | .6 | 2.9 | 21.3\n |\n| 1995–96 | Miami | 70 | 70 | **38.2** | .523 | .300 | .685 | 10.4 | **2.3** | **1.0** | 2.7 | **23.2** |\n| 1996–97 | Miami | 66 | 65 | 35.2 | .534 | .111 | .642 | 9.9 | 1.6 | .8 | 2.9 | 19.8\n |\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 58 | 56 | 33.4 | .551 | .000 | .665 | 9.6 | .9 | .7 | 2.2 | 19.2\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 46 | 46 | 38.1 | .511 | .000 | .652 | **11.0** | 1.6 | .7 | **3.9\\*** | 20.1\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | **79** | **78** | 34.8 | .551 | .000 | .711 | 9.5 | 1.6 | .5 | 3.7\\* | 21.7\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 13 | 3 | 23.5 | .518 | .000 | .564 | 7.8 | .9 | .3 | 2.4 | 13.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Miami | 75 | 74 | 32.7 | .516 | **.333** | .657 | 8.4 | 1.2 | .4 | 2.5 | 15.7\n |\n| 2003–04 | New Jersey | 12 | 0 | 17.9 | .465 | .000 | **.882** | 2.3 | .7 | .2 | .5 | 8.0\n |\n| 2004–05 | New Jersey | 18 | 14 | 25.4 | .453 | .000 | .593 | 7.1 | .8 | .3 | 2.3 | 10.4\n |\n| 2004–05 | Miami | 19 | 3 | 12.9 | .516 | .000 | .564 | 3.7 | .2 | .2 | 1.7 | 5.0\n |\n| 2005–06†\n | Miami | 65 | 20 | 20.0 | **.597** | .000 | .594 | 5.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.7 | 7.8\n |\n| 2006–07 | Miami | 77 | 43 | 20.4 | .560 | .000 | .601 | 4.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.3 | 8.6\n |\n| 2007–08 | Miami | 25 | 0 | 15.6 | .547 | .000 | .592 | 3.7 | .3 | .2 | 1.7 | 6.0\n |\n| Career\n | 838 | 686 | 31.0 | .527 | .247 | .692 | 8.5 | 1.1 | .5 | 2.8 | 17.1\n |\n| All-Star\n | 4 | 1 | 18.8 | .545 | .000 | .667 | 4.8 | 1.0 | .8 | 2.0 | 10.0\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993 | Charlotte | 9 | 9 | 40.8 | .480 | .000 | .774 | 9.9 | 1.4 | .7 | **3.4** | **23.8** |\n| 1995 | Charlotte | 4 | 4 | **43.5** | .421 | **.500** | **.837** | **13.3** | **2.8** | .8 | 3.3\\* | 22.0\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 30.7 | .486 | .000 | .714 | 6.0 | 1.3 | .7 | 1.0 | 18.0\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | 17 | **17** | 37.1 | .491 | .375 | .555 | 10.2 | 1.1 | .6 | 2.7\\* | 17.8\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 4 | 4 | 34.5 | .518 | .000 | .655 | 8.5 | 1.3 | .8 | 2.5 | 19.3\n |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 38.8 | .521 | .000 | .653 | 8.2 | .8 | **1.6** | 2.8 | 21.6\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 10 | 10 | 37.6 | .484 | .000 | .667 | 10.0 | 1.4 | .2 | 3.3\\* | 21.6\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 30.3 | .480 | .000 | .579 | 5.3 | 1.0 | .0 | 1.7 | 11.7\n |\n| 2005 | Miami | 15 | 2 | 16.9 | .705 | .000 | .558 | 4.8 | .3 | .3 | 2.2 | 6.1\n |\n| 2006†\n | Miami | **21** | 0 | 10.8 | .703 | .000 | .667 | 2.9 | .1 | .2 | 1.1 | 3.8\n |\n| 2007 | Miami | 4 | 0 | 13.8 | **.909** | .000 | .385 | 2.0 | .3 | .0 | .8 | 6.3\n |\n| Career\n | 95 | 57 | 27.3 | .512 | .368 | .649 | 7.0 | .9 | .5 | 2.3 | 13.6\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Mourning to head player development\". *ESPN.com*.

In the case of jersey numbers, they are usually no longer available for future players to wear, although they can ask for permission from players whose jerseys are retired. Teams usually display these numbers by hanging banners on the rafters inside their home arena. As of 2022, only two teams in the NBA do not have any retired numbers: the Los Angeles Clippers and the Toronto Raptors. Two players have had their numbers retired by teams they did not play for, and only one player (Bill Russell) had his number retired league wide.\n\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n**Key:**\n\n\n\n † \nInducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame\n ‡ \nNumber retired league-wide\n\n\nRetired NBA numbers\n| No.\n | Name\n | Team\n | Pos.\n | Years with franchise\n | Note\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 | Bob Pettit†\n | Atlanta Hawks | F | 1954–1965 | Did not play for franchise in Atlanta.

In the case of jersey numbers, they are usually no longer available for future players to wear, although they can ask for permission from players whose jerseys are retired. Teams usually display these numbers by hanging banners on the rafters inside their home arena. As of 2022, only two teams in the NBA do not have any retired numbers: the Los Angeles Clippers and the Toronto Raptors. Two players have had their numbers retired by teams they did not play for, and only one player (Bill Russell) had his number retired league wide.\n\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n**Key:**\n\n\n\n † \nInducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame\n ‡ \nNumber retired league-wide\n\n\nRetired NBA numbers\n| No.\n | Name\n | Team\n | Pos.\n | Years with franchise\n | Note\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 | Bob Pettit†\n | Atlanta Hawks | F | 1954–1965 | Did not play for franchise in Atlanta.

A Texas Mr. Basketball in high school, he played one season of college basketball for Georgia Tech before declaring for the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\nWhile at Toronto, Bosh became a five-time NBA All-Star, was named to the All-NBA Second Team once, played for the U.S. national team (with whom he won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics), and supplanted former fan favorite Vince Carter as the face and leader of the Raptors franchise. In the 2006–07 season, Bosh led the Raptors to their first playoff appearance in five years and their first-ever division title. He left Toronto in 2010 as the franchise's all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, and minutes played.[1]\n\n\nIn 2010, after seven seasons with the Raptors, Bosh entered into a sign-and-trade deal whereby he was traded to the Miami Heat.[2] In Miami, he joined fellow stars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James; the trio became known as the Big Three. Bosh spent the second half of his career with Miami, appearing in the NBA Finals each year from 2011 to 2014 and winning NBA titles in 2012 and 2013. He made the NBA All-Star team every year during his time in Miami. Bosh's career was cut short by a blood clotting condition that the NBA ruled to be a career-ending illness.[3][4] He played his final NBA game on February 9, 2016.[5] Notwithstanding the NBA's ruling, Bosh fought to resume his playing career for three years[6] before announcing in February 2019 that he intended to retire.[7] The same year, the Heat retired his No. 1 jersey.[8][9] In 2021, Bosh was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\nSeeking to promote sports and education amongst youths in Dallas and Toronto, Bosh set up the Chris Bosh Foundation and regularly speaks to youths about the benefits of reading.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn to Noel and Freida Bosh in Dallas, Texas,[11] Bosh was raised in Hutchins, a suburb of the city.[12] A family-oriented person, Bosh would often play basketball in the house with his younger brother, Joel.[13] At the early age of four years old, he started learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym where his father played pick-up games.[14] Since Bosh was always tall for his age, he was accustomed to out-rebounding his peers whenever he played;[15] but he only started learning the game of basketball seriously around fourth grade, doing so at a playground near his grandmother's house.[13]\n\n\nAs a child, Bosh participated in karate and gymnastics.[16] He also played baseball up until high school, chiefly as a first baseman according to his preference.[13]\n\n\nGrowing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influence on his personality and considers NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, after whom he modeled his play.[15] Academically, Bosh always excelled in school[17] as he was a member of the National Honor Society and several student engineering organizations.[16]\n\n\nBosh began garnering significant attention from college recruiters after he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and to the *USA Today* National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.[18]\n\n\nThe 6-foot-11 teenager helped Lincoln High capture the Class 4A state title as he delivered 23 points and 17 rebounds to go along with 9 blocks. Bosh was subsequently named High School Player of the Year by Basketball America; Powerade Player of the Year in Texas; a first-team All-American by *Parade*, McDonald's, and EA Sports; a second-team all-American by *USA Today* and *SLAM* Magazine; a first-team all-state player; and \"Mr. Basketball\" in Texas by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches.[18] With his combination of grades and basketball skills, Bosh's name was on a number of college recruiting lists. The University of Florida and University of Memphis among them made serious overtures, but it was Paul Hewitt, coach of Georgia Tech, who made the best impression. Bosh felt that Hewitt had his best interests at heart and respected his aspiration to play professionally; moreover, he was sufficiently impressed by what he saw of Georgia Tech's transition offense.[17]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nBosh eventually chose to follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management.[13] There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so.[11] Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, but by the end of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA.[17] He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season[11] and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career.[15]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors (2003–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh shooting a free throw during a game in the 2005–06 season\n#### Rookie year (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nIn what is widely regarded as one of the strongest draft classes in NBA history, which included future All-Stars LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade,[17] Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in the 2003 NBA draft and was signed on July 8, 2003.[19] Prior to his signing, however, other NBA teams made offers for Bosh as they knew Toronto needed a veteran scorer, and Raptors star Vince Carter himself pressed for a trade. General Manager Glen Grunwald turned everyone down.[17]\n\n\nIn his rookie season, Bosh was forced to play out of position as the Raptors' starting center after Antonio Davis was traded to the Chicago Bulls.[20] Night after night, the teenager with the \"slim frame\" battled against opponents who had a significant size and strength advantage over him.[20] Bosh—who cited teammate Michael Curry as his mentor[15]—was often praised by his coaches for his heart, and willingness to play through pain and injuries resulting from his lack of body strength compared to some of the league's strong forwards and centers.[21] Bosh's contributions were not unnoticed by teammates either,[22] as he averaged 11.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and 33.5 minutes in 75 games, leading all rookies in rebounding and blocks, and setting a franchise record for most rebounds in a rookie season with 557.[11] Bosh was rewarded by being selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2003–04 season.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Heralded as the new hope (2004–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh and his teammates in a 2005–06 game against the Milwaukee Bucks. From left: Pape Sow, Bosh, Mike James and Morris Peterson.\nWith the departure of the disenchanted franchise face of the team, Vince Carter, in December 2004, Bosh was simultaneously anointed as the new leader around whom Toronto would build.[23] In the remaining games following Carter's departure, the power forward averaged 18.4 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 38.1 minutes per game, improving in every major statistical category.[11] He was awarded his first ever NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played between January 3 and 9, 2005.[11] As the season drew to a close, analysts predicted that Bosh would become an All-Star one day.[24][25] Bosh ended the 2004–05 season as the leading scorer and leading rebounder for the team on 21 and 46 occasions respectively.[11]\n\n\nPrior to the 2005–06 season, Bosh was named as one of Toronto's team captains. Bosh continued to work on his game as he consistently chalked up double-doubles, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage for the first half of the season.[26] On February 9, 2006, for the first time in his career, Bosh was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference.[11] He was only the third Raptor to make an All-Star game, after Carter and Antonio Davis. Bosh's selection was just three days after he was named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career.[26] In March 2006, following a season-ending injury to Bosh,[27] the Raptors hit a 1–10 skid.[28] This highlighted Bosh's importance as the centerpiece of the offense, as well as the leader of the team. The Raptors finished the season 27–55 and Bosh averaged 22.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.[29]\n\n\n\n#### Leader of the division champions (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh improved his numbers in ppg and rpg in the 2006–07 season and had to lead a vastly different team from the 2005–06 roster.\nDespite a major off-season revamp of the Raptors roster—including the departure of good friends Mike James and Charlie Villanueva—Bosh officially signed a three-year contract extension with a player option for a fourth year on July 14, 2006.[30][31] The deal was reportedly worth US$65 million over four years.[32] Upon signing the contract, Bosh said \"I think the future is very positive for the franchise... change was needed... we have a lot of guys who just want to win and are willing to work hard.\"[32] During the same press conference, Bosh also announced a donation of $1 million to a Toronto charity, known as Community Legacy Programs.[30]\n\n\nAfter a shaky start to the Raptors' 2006–07 campaign, the Raptors managed to surpass the .500 mark as the All-Star break approached.[33] Bosh's play and leadership were pivotal to this run and as an increasing recognition of his abilities, on January 25, 2007, he was named an All-Star starter for the East in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. Bosh received the second highest number of votes among all Eastern Conference forwards.[34] This was his first All-Star start and second overall All-Star appearance, having averaged over 22 points and 11 rebounds in the first half of the season.[34] On January 31, 2007, in a game against the Washington Wizards, Bosh scored a 65-foot (20 m) buzzer-beating shot to end the third quarter of the game.[35] He shot 15-of-15 after missing his first four shots.[36] Bosh's in-form streak enabled him to be selected Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January 2007.[37] He had averaged 25.4 points and 9.1 rebounds while leading the Raptors to a 10–5 record in that month. On February 7, 2007, Bosh's career-high 41 points prompted the home fans to chant \"MVP\"—an unprecedented event in the Air Canada Centre.[38] Two days later, Bosh collected 29 points and 11 rebounds against the Los Angeles Lakers, shooting 10-of-10 in the second half.[39]\n\n\nOn March 28, 2007, Bosh became the new franchise record holder for double-doubles in a home win against the Miami Heat.[40] He was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the third time in his career shortly after,[41] having led Toronto to clinch a playoff berth for the first time in five years. Toronto went on to win its first ever division title, and concluded the regular season with a 47–35 record, including a 30–11 home record, both franchise records.[42] As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in the first round of the 2007 NBA playoffs. The series drew much media attention as Carter, who had left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances, was back at the ACC as a Net.[43] Toronto's inexperience was evident as they struggled offensively throughout the game, to eventually lose 96–91.[43] The Raptors won game 2 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds.[44] The Nets won Games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5.[45] The Nets went on to clinch the series with a win in game 6.[46] Bosh averaged a double-double with 22.6 ppg and 10.7 rpg for the regular season, both career-highs, and posted 17.5 ppg and 9.0 rpg for the playoffs.[29] He was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Struggles (2007–2009)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2007\nBefore the 2007–08 season began, Andrea Bargnani, the number one pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was slated to start at center and Bosh at power forward to form a strong Toronto frontcourt and Jason Kapono, a three-point specialist, was acquired via free agency from the Miami Heat to add offensive firepower; however, as the season unfolded, neither plans materialized as hoped.[48] Bosh himself had a slow start to the season, but as mid-season approached, his form picked up and he was named Player of the Week for the second week of January.[49] On January 31, 2008, he was selected to be on the Eastern Conference team for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game.[50] Bosh missed 15 games throughout the season, but the Raptors still managed to conclude the regular season with a 41–41 record, thus clinching the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 NBA playoffs. However, they were defeated by the Orlando Magic in the first round, losing 4–1.[51]\n\n\nThe first-round series against the Magic was touted as the matchup between two of the league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard.[52] Howard dominated throughout the series, while Bosh had a series-best effort in game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds.[53] General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, \"Whether it's protecting [Bosh] inside the paint, getting a little bit more of a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better\", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul.[54] Bosh said after the loss, \"They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good.\"[51] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.[55]\n\n\nTo provide Bosh with an experienced frontcourt partner, the Raptors pulled a blockbuster trade prior to the 2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers.[56] Bosh—who had won an Olympic gold medal with the national team at Beijing 2008—started the season strong. He averaged 26 points, 10 rebounds and 3.7 assists in his first three games and was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the fifth time in his career.[57] A week later, he became Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds, surpassing Antonio Davis's record.[58] While Bosh and O'Neal formed a formidable partnership in the frontcourt, the Raptors struggled to surpass the .500 mark. The principal deficiency of previous campaigns—wing players—continued to upend Toronto's progress.[59] With the Raptors at 8–9, head coach Sam Mitchell was sacked and replaced by Jay Triano.[60] Despite the move, injuries and weaknesses in the roster meant that the Raptors entered the All-Star break 13 games under .500.[61] On January 29, 2009, Bosh was named an All-Star reserve,[62] but an injury ruled him out of the game. Two weeks later, in a bid to bring in a wing player and create greater salary flexibility, O'Neal and Jamario Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[61] The trade did not improve the team's win–loss record, however, and the Raptors were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining.[63] The bright spark in Bosh's campaign was his career-high 22.7 points per game, as well as his being one of two players in the league that season (the other being Dwight Howard) to average a 20/10 in points and rebounds.[64] On April 20, 2009, Colangelo announced that he would offer Bosh a contract extension during the summer,[65] which Bosh later refused to sign.[66]\n\n\n\n#### Overhauling the roster (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nTo prepare for the 2009–10 season, Bosh worked out under Ken Roberson, looking to add 20 pounds (9 kg) and bring his weight up to 250 lb (110 kg).[66] Following the failure of the 2008–09 campaign, Colangelo knew that he had to shake up the roster to persuade Bosh to stay, and the Raptors were one of the busiest teams in the pre-season market.[67] They opened their season with a win against the heavily favored Cleveland Cavaliers, in which Bosh scored 21 points and pulled down 16 rebounds.[68] Bosh went on a tear, averaging 25.4 points and 11.9 rebounds in the first 16 games, but the Raptors were only able to win seven of those games.[68][69] The Raptors crossed into 2010 with a 16–17 record, and on January 3, 2010, Bosh overtook Vince Carter as Toronto's all-time leader in total points scored.[70] After pulling together a string of wins, Toronto were .500 after 40 games. Bosh was the league leader in double-doubles at the time, being only one of two players in the league who averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game.[71] On January 20, 2010, he scored a career-high 44 points in a loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, while collecting his 220th career double-double.[72] That same month, Bosh was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team,[73] and was Eastern Conference Player of the Week.[74] After the All-Star break, the Raptors went on several losing streaks and an injury to Bosh exacerbated the situation. As the regular season came to a close, the Raptors went from being the fifth seed before the All-Star break to fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot with the Chicago Bulls. After recording his 44th double-double on March 22, 2010, Bosh became the Raptors' all-time leader in number of double-doubles in a season. On April 5, 2010, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, winning the honor for the seventh time in his career (tying Carter for the most in franchise history).[75] However, Bosh was unable to play in a pivotal match against the Bulls on April 11, 2010. The blowout loss cost Toronto their tie-breaker and ultimately the eighth seed, as the Bulls finished with 41 wins to Toronto's 40.[76]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2010–2017)[edit]\n\n\n#### Joining the Heat and debut season (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2010\nAfter the 2009–10 season was over, there was much speculation over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. Bosh signed with the Miami Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal, which sent two 2011 first-round draft picks to the Raptors (Norris Cole and Jonas Valančiūnas were later selected).[77][78] Bosh was a part of the first player-created NBA superteam.[79] Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, \"[K]now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me. I've loved every minute here and I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart...\"[80] Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, he was one of only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.[81]\n\n\nDespite being widely tipped as contenders, the Heat got off to a tentative 9–8 start. The Heat managed to go on to compile a 21–1 record, however, and were jostling with the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls for pole position in the Eastern Conference as mid-season approached.[82] Miami finished the regular season with 58 wins and faced Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs. Miami won the series in five games, and also prevailed in five games in the semi-finals against Boston. In the Conference Finals against Chicago, Bosh was particularly instrumental, averaging 23.2 points in the 4–1 series win. He was slow off the blocks in the Finals against Dallas, shooting below .300 in the first two games, but scored the winning shot in game 3 to give Miami a 2–1 lead. That was the last game Miami won, as Dallas won the next three to win its first-ever championship. Bosh was seen sobbing as he walked to the locker room following the loss.\n\n\n\n#### Consecutive NBA championships (2011–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in a layup line before a game against the Dallas Mavericks in 2012\nOn January 5, 2012, Bosh led the Heat to a 116–109 triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks, highlighted by a three-point shot he made to force the game into overtime with 0.6 seconds left to play in the fourth quarter. Bosh finished the game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocked shots.[83] By season's end, the Heat had embraced a small-ball strategy that featured Bosh at the center position. In the playoffs, Bosh averaged 14.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a game. In game 1 of the Conference Semi-finals against the Indiana Pacers, he suffered a lower abdominal strain that forced him to miss the rest of the series and the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston. Bosh returned in the Conference Finals against the Celtics. He was moved to center for the remainder of the playoffs, while James, who had filled in at power forward during his absence, remained at that position.[84][85] Boston pushed Miami to seven games, and in the final game, Bosh scored 19 points, including 3-of-4 shooting from three-point range, to help the Heat advance to their second straight NBA Finals, this time against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder won the first game of the series before Miami rolled to a 4–1 victory, giving Bosh his first NBA championship. Bosh scored 24 points in the deciding game 5 and averaged 14.6 points and 9.4 rebounds in the Finals.\n\n\nBosh remained the Heat's starting center during the 2012–13 season. On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra.[86] The Heat achieved the league's best record and swept through the first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in five games, with Bosh scoring 20 points to go with 19 rebounds in a crucial game 3 win in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs, as the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven-game series against Indiana. The Heat and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs blew out Miami in game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead. In game 4, Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to complement Wade's 32 points and James's 33 points to bolster the Heat's win, tying the series. San Antonio would bounce back in game 5 to force the Heat to win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide-open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA championship.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Coming up short (2013–2014)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Bosh played and started in 79 games, averaging 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He also hit a career-high 74 three-point shots on 33 percent shooting from beyond the arc. In the playoffs, Bosh helped the Heat return to the NBA Finals, where they faced the San Antonio Spurs once again. This time, however, the Heat were outclassed by the Spurs, as they lost the series in five games.\n\n\n\n#### Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 30, 2014, after wide speculation that he would join the Houston Rockets, Bosh re-signed with the Heat to a five-year, $118 million contract after LeBron James announced he was leaving Miami to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[88][89] After averaging 21.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals over the first 23 games of the 2014–15 season, Bosh was ruled out indefinitely on December 15 with a strained calf.[90] He went on to miss eight games before returning on December 29 against the Orlando Magic.[91] After playing in the 2015 All-Star Game, Bosh was admitted to a Miami hospital for lung tests during the All-Star break.[92][93] On February 21, 2015, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a blood clot in one of his lungs.[94]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2015, Bosh made his return to the court in the Heat's season opener against the Charlotte Hornets, recording 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 104–94 win.[95] On November 10, 2015, he scored a then season-high 30 points in a 101–88 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[96] On December 28, 2015, he recorded 24 points and 12 rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets, and hit a career-best 5-of-5 from three-point range.[97] On January 4, 2016, he recorded a season-high 31 points and 11 rebounds in a 103–100 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers.[98] Though he was voted to play in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, and selected to compete in the Three-Point Contest, due to a calf injury, Bosh was forced to withdraw from both.[99]\n\n\nA blood clot in his leg again forced Bosh to miss time following the 2016 All-Star break. He faced increasing pressure from physicians and the Heat organization to sit out the rest of the season because of the potential dangers of the recurring medical condition.[100] Following the Heat's February 9 game against San Antonio, Bosh did not play any regular-season or playoff games for Miami in 2016.[3][101][102] On May 4, 2016, the Heat announced that Bosh would be held out for the remainder of the playoffs.[3]\n\n\n\n#### Comeback attempts and retirement (2016–2019)[edit]\n\n\nBosh was initially optimistic about a return to the Heat for the 2016–17 season, and the organization had become increasingly hopeful that he would be cleared for camp. Those hopes quickly faded due to Bosh's continued issues with blood clotting.[103] In September 2016, Bosh failed his physical exam and was not cleared by the team to participate in training camp.[104] On September 26, 2016, Heat president Pat Riley said that the team viewed Bosh's career with the team as over.[105] In May 2017, Bosh and the Heat reportedly reached a unique agreement in which Bosh would leave the Heat without his salary taking up the team's salary cap space for the 2017–18 season.[106]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2017, the NBA ruled that Bosh's blood clotting issues were a career-ending illness, meaning the Heat would be allowed to remove his contract from their salary cap once they officially released him.[4] Two days later, the Heat announced that they had waived Bosh, ending a seven-year stint with the organization.[107] Following Bosh's release, Heat President Pat Riley said, \"The number '1' will never be worn by another player and we can't wait to someday hang his jersey in the rafters\".[108] In February 2018, Bosh declared himself on the comeback trail, having refused to rule out a return to the NBA.[6][109]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2019, Bosh announced that he was no longer pursuing his NBA career[110] and that he planned to retire from the NBA when his jersey was retired by the Heat.[111] The Heat retired Bosh's No. 1 jersey on March 26 before a regular season game against the Orlando Magic.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|

when he was selected as a member of the 2002 USA Basketball Junior World Championship Qualifying Team that finished with a 4–1 record and the bronze medal.[112]\n\n\nAfter his NBA career began, Bosh was named in March 2006 to the 2006–2008 United States men's national basketball team program, and helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour.[112] In August 2006, Bosh was named as a member of the 2006 USA World Championship Team.[112] Together with fellow 2003 draftees Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kirk Hinrich, this team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal, defeating former 2004 Olympic champion Argentina.[113] Bosh was ranked sixth in field goal percentage.[112]\n\n\nFollowing the 2006–07 season, Bosh was named to the team that would compete in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. However, he sustained a foot injury and withdrew from the squad.[114] On June 23, 2008, he was named to the team that would compete in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.[115] During the tournament itself, Bosh operated as the main backup to center Dwight Howard as Team USA went unbeaten in all eight games en route to the gold medal, defeating Spain in the final.[116] He averaged 9.1 points per game, and led the team in rebounds with 6.1 a game.[117]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Bosh withdrew his name from consideration for the 2012 Olympics in London to recover from a lower abdominal strain that kept him out of some playoff games.[118]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> You are not going to see a whole lot of screaming and hollering at guys... He is a guy that is going to pull somebody aside and say it in a positive way, and I think it goes a lot farther that way.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAnthony Parker on Bosh's leadership[119]\n\n![](image)The mid-range jump shot was one of Bosh's trademark moves.\nBosh traditionally played the power forward position, including during his first season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) and 235 pounds (107 kg),[29] Bosh possessed excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size.[120] He was particularly noted for his ability to drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he was also proficient, but he was also known for his well-developed jump shot.[121] Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: \"We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work either. I don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth.\"[122] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions.[123] He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left.[124] It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his \"arrival\" to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime.[11] When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot .343 from the three-point arc for the season; he improved to .400 the following season.[29] Because of his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.\n\n\nBosh was noted for his leadership. When he was the leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to maintain his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic.[121] However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who made bad calls on the court.[125] Throughout his career, comparisons were made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.\n\n\n\n## Honors and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* **NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Month**: January 2007\n* **9× NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week**: January 3, 2005; January 30, 2006; March 26, 2007; January 7, 2008; October 28, 2008; February 1, 2010; April 5, 2010; December 23, 2013; October 28, 2014\n* **NBA Atlantic Division champion**: 2007\n* **4× NBA Southeast Division champion**: 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n* **2× NBA champion**: 2012, 2013\n* **11× NBA All-Star**: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016\n* **All-NBA Second Team**: 2007\n* **NBA All-Rookie Team**: 2004\n* **2× NBA Rookie All-Star Game**: 2004, 2005\n* **3× NBA Shooting Stars champion** (with Swin Cash and Dominique Wilkins) 2013, 2014, 2015[126]\n* Bronze medal winner with Team USA at the 2006 FIBA World Championship\n* Gold medal winner with Team USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics\n* Third-youngest player in NBA history to record 1,000 rebounds[11]\n* Fourth-youngest player in NBA history to record 20 points and 20 rebounds in a game[11]\n* Toronto's first player to achieve 10,000 points\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in defensive rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds per game\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds per game in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in blocks\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws made[127]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws made in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws attempted[127]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws attempted in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in double-doubles[40]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in double-doubles in a season\n* NBA Sportsmanship Award (divisional winner): 2007–08[128]\n* Elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh at the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards\nBesides his on-the-court exploits, Bosh was a National Honor Society member and graduated with honors from Lincoln.[14] He is also a member of the National Society of Black Engineers and the Dallas Association of Minority Engineers.[14] Following his success in the NBA, Bosh soon had his own YouTube channel,[129] and has since made various TV appearances. In December 2009, First Ink, a DVD featuring comedic digital shorts and a documentary about Bosh, was released. The DVD was filmed during the summer of 2009.[130] A fan of the *X-Men* television series as a child, Bosh voiced the Marvel Comics character Heimdall in an episode of *Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.* in 2014.[131][132] He also made appearances on episodes of *Entourage* and *Parks and Recreation*.[133]\n\n\nIn the field of philanthropy, Bosh established the Chris Bosh Foundation in 2004. Remembering the challenges he faced as a youth,[14] Bosh founded the organization to help younger people in academics and athletics.[134] The Foundation, with programs in Toronto and Dallas, has worked closely with organizations such as the Toronto Special Olympics to raise important funding for community projects.[14] Bosh's mother, Freida, has served as CEO of the Foundation.[134] As an avid reader, Bosh also regularly speaks to groups of children about the benefits of reading,[12] and has received the NBA Community Assist Award for his active contributions for the Raptors community development program in Toronto and Dallas during the course of the NBA campaign.[135] In November 2008, Bosh pledged to donate $75,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada.[136] He is also an advocate for increased computer literacy in schools, supporting the non-profit code.org.[137]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2011, Bosh married Adrienne Williams.[138][139] They renewed their vows on July 16, 2011.[140] The couple have five children, three sons and two daughters.[141][142]\n\n\nBosh has dabbled in hip-hop production. In 2017, alongside record producer, songwriter, and singer Rico Love, Bosh co-produced a song titled \"Miss My Woe\" by Gucci Mane.[143] The song is featured on Gucci's 11th studio album titled, *Mr. Davis*.\n\n\nIn June 2021, Bosh published his book, *Letters to a Young Athlete.*[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n### Paternity lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nOn March 24, 2009, it was reported that Bosh's former girlfriend, Allison Mathis, was seeking child support and sole custody of their daughter, Trinity (born November 2, 2008). Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home.[147] Three days later, it was reported that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid.[148] Mathis' lawyer also told the press, \"My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything on our side... She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to have a good relationship with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult.\"[148]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* Toronto Raptors accomplishments and records\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chiari, Mike. \"Chris Bosh on NBA Career: 'I've Made the Decision Not to Pursue It Anymore'\". *Bleacher Report*.

Wade is also Miami's all-time leader in points, games, assists, steals, shots made, and shots taken.[5] Wade is widely regarded as one of the greatest shooting guards in NBA history.[6][7][8] Wade is currently the host of the American adaptation of *The Cube*.\n\n\nAfter a successful college basketball career with the Marquette Golden Eagles, including leading the team to the Final Four in 2003, Wade was drafted fifth overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Heat. In his third season, Wade led the Heat to their first NBA Championship and was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Wade led the United States men's basketball team, commonly known as the \"Redeem Team\", in scoring and helped them capture the gold medal. In the 2008–09 season, Wade led the league in both total points (2,386) and points per game (30.2), the latter stat earning him his sole NBA scoring title. Wade was selected as the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 2010. With LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Wade helped guide Miami to four consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 to 2014, and won back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. Wade briefly left Miami to play for the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers throughout 2016–2018 before returning to Miami to finish his playing career and retire with the Heat in 2019. The Heat retired his #3 jersey in 2020. He purchased a minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz in 2021. In October 2021, Wade was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[9] In 2023, it was announced that Wade would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nWade was born the second of two children to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr. in Chicago, Illinois, on January 17, 1982. Wade attributes the uncommon spelling of his and his father's first name to his grandmother.[11] JoLinda already had two children when she married Wade's father, and with him she had Dwyane and his older sister Tragil. The pair separated when Wade was four months old. Wade described his early childhood in the South Side of Chicago as trying.[12]\n\n\nWhen his parents divorced, JoLinda was given custody of the two children. JoLinda struggled with drug addiction and often committed crimes that sent her to prison. At eight years old, Tragil tricked her brother Dwyane into thinking they were going to the movies, only to take him to live with his father and stepmother. Wade visited his mother on occasion until his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois, after which Wade would not see her for two years.[13]\n\n\nWade turned to basketball and football, avoiding the temptations of drugs and gangs. Wade credited Tragil as the person most responsible for pointing him in the right direction.[14] Wade grew up idolizing Michael Jordan and modeled his game after him.[15] On October 14, 2001, as Wade's basketball career blossomed, JoLinda vowed to turn her life around. She says that she has not used drugs since 2003.[16]\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\nWade played basketball and football for Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. He immediately excelled as a wide receiver and also played as a backup quarterback, but success in basketball took longer.[14] He grew four inches by the start of his junior year and emerged as the team leader, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds.[17]\n\n\nWade's improvement continued into his senior year, when he averaged 27 points and 11 rebounds.[18] He led the Bulldogs to a 24–5 record and to a Class AA Eisenhower Sectional appearance. Wade set school records for points scored (676) and steals made (106).[19] He credited coach Jack Fitzgerald as a seminal and positive influence. Wade was recruited to play basketball only by Marquette, Illinois State, and DePaul, due to disqualifyingly low ACT scores.[13]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nWade committed to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to play under coach Tom Crean. In his freshman year, Wade was sidelined by NCAA Proposition 48, which set academic eligibility requirements for participation in Division I sports. Effort and tutoring[20] sufficiently raised his academic standing so that he became eligible by the start of his sophomore year.[21]\n\n\n\n### 2001–02 season[edit]\n\n\nWade led the Marquette Golden Eagles in scoring with 17.8 points (ppg) and led Conference USA in both steals per game with 2.47 and 2-point field goals made with 205;[22] he averaged 6.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists.[23] Marquette finished with a 26–7 record, their best since the 1993–94 season.[19]\n\n\n\n### 2002–03 season[edit]\n\n\nWade again led the school in scoring with 21.5 points and the Golden Eagles finished with a 27–6 record.[24] Three days after JoLinda was released from prison, she saw Wade play basketball for the first time in five years as Marquette upset the Cincinnati Bearcats, 70–61, to capture the Conference USA title on March 8, 2003. He helped bring the Golden Eagles to the Final Four for the first time since their 1977 national championship season. Wade was subsequently named to the All-America First Team by the Associated Press (AP), making him the first basketball player from Marquette to receive the distinction since 1978.[19]\n\n\nWade's performance during the Midwest Regional final drew national attention. Against a top-seeded Kentucky team, he delivered 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists, including a memorable breakaway dunk, as Marquette upset the Wildcats, 83–69, and advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1977. Wade's triple double was the fourth ever recorded in NCAA tournament history. The Golden Eagles finished their season as No.6 in the AP Poll, Marquette's highest ranking since 1976–77. Wade was named the MVP of the Midwest Regional. His performance earned him a high NBA draft projection.[25] As a result, Wade skipped his senior year to enter the 2003 NBA draft.\n\n\nMarquette retired his jersey on February 3, 2007. It ordinarily requires student-athletes to have graduated for jersey retirement, but made an exception for Wade.[26]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2003–2016)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie year (2003–04)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade dunking the ball during the 2004 Rookie Challenge game for the Rookies team\nSelected fifth in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, Wade became the highest ranked of only four Marquette first round draft picks.[27] Wade quickly emerged as a productive player, averaging 16.2 points on 46.5% shooting as well as 4 rebounds and 4.5 assists.[28] After a 5–15 start, the Heat gradually improved to finish 42–40 and qualify for the playoffs.[29] Wade served up outstanding postseason performances, particularly against the Indiana Pacers during the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[27] Wade earned a unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team[27] and finished third in Rookie of the Year voting (after LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony).[27] He placed among the top five rookies in several statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played.[27]\n\n\nIn the first playoff game, Wade hit a running jumper with 1.3 seconds left in the final quarter to give the Heat an 81–79 victory over the New Orleans Hornets. Winning that series 4–3, the Heat faced the Indiana Pacers, who were the top-seeded team with the best record in the NBA. The Heat lost the series 4–2. Wade became only the fourth rookie in the shot clock era to lead his team in points and assists during the postseason.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Breakthrough year (2004–05)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with the ball versus the Milwaukee Bucks in 2005\nThe Heat traded with the Los Angeles Lakers for center Shaquille O'Neal. Improving on their previous season's 42–40 record by 17 games, Miami went 59–23, leading the Eastern Conference.[30] Wade earned a reserve slot in the season's All-Star Game; adding 14 points in 24 minutes of play.[28]\n\n\nIn the first round of the 2005 playoffs, Wade averaged 26.3 points, 8.8 assists, and 6 rebounds a night while maintaining a 50% field-goal percentage as the Heat swept the New Jersey Nets.[31] In the second round he averaged 31 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists per game as the Heat swept the Washington Wizards.[31] The Heat lost the Eastern Conference Finals 4–3 to the Detroit Pistons, the previous season's champions. Wade scored 42 points in Game 2 and 36 in Game 3 despite playing with sinusitis, the flu, and a knee strain. He suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 that prevented him from playing in the sixth game and limited him in the seventh.[32][30]\n\n\n\n#### NBA champion and Finals MVP (2005–06)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade at the free throw line\nIn the 2005–06 season, Wade was elected to the All-Star Game as a starter. During 30 minutes of play, he put up 20 points on 9-of-11 field goals.[33] Wade finished the regular season averaging 27.2 points, 6.7 assists, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.95 steals.[34]\n\n\nIn the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Miami played the Chicago Bulls. Wade incurred several injuries, including a severely bruised hip during Game 5.[35] He scored 15 of his 28 points while suffering intense pain, to give the Heat a 3–2 series lead. Wade led Miami past the Detroit Pistons despite experiencing flu-like symptoms in Game 6.[36] In the series-clinching contest, he landed 14 points and 10 assists.[36]\n\n\nDuring the 2006 NBA Finals, Miami faced the Dallas Mavericks. Wade's 42, 36, and 43 points in Games 3, 4, and 5, respectively, helped the Heat go from a 0–2 deficit to a 3–2 series lead.[37] In Game 3, Wade's 42 points tied his playoff-high and his 13 rebounds were a career-high.[38][39] The Heat took Game 6 behind Wade's 36 points, taking the series 4–2, earning Wade the Finals MVP trophy.[40] He became the fifth-youngest player in NBA history to capture the Finals MVP award, and his 34.7 points were the Finals' third-highest among players in their first NBA Finals.[41] His 33.8 player efficiency rating (PER) over the NBA Finals was ranked by John Hollinger of ESPN as the best since the NBA-ABA merger.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Injuries and missing playoffs (2006–2008)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, Wade missed 31 games due to injury; even so, he was elected to his third consecutive All-Star Game and received All-NBA honors. He became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing 31 or more games since Pete Maravich.[27] The Heat struggled with injuries in general and were 20–25 on February 1, 2007.[43] Playing the Houston Rockets on February 21, 2007, Wade dislocated his left shoulder and left the court in a wheelchair.[44] Wade chose to delay surgery and instead rehabilitate his shoulder in time for the postseason.[45] After missing 23 games, Wade returned to the active roster. Sporting a black shoulder sleeve, Wade played 27 minutes and notched 12 points and 8 assists in the 111–103 overtime loss.[46] For the season, Wade averaged 27.4 points, 7.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.1 steals, while shooting 50% from the field; further, he finished the season as the NBA PER leader.[47]\n\n\nDuring the 2007 playoffs, Wade averaged 23.5 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.8 rebounds per contest, but were swept in the first round by the Chicago Bulls.[48] Post-playoffs, Wade underwent a pair of surgeries to repair his dislocated left shoulder and left knee, both of which proved successful. However, the knee ailment, commonly called \"jumper's knee\", prevented Wade from joining USA Basketball in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament over that summer.[49]\n\n\nAfter missing the Tournament of Americas' Olympic Qualifiers as well as the preseason and the first seven games, Wade began the 2007–08 season on November 14, 2007.[50] Despite battling pain in his injured knee throughout the season,[51] Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance.[52] However, the Heat held the worst record in the NBA. Wade's knee problems led Riley sit Wade for the final 21 games to undergo long overdue OssaTron treatment.[53] Wade averaged 24.6 points, 6.9 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.7 steals.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Scoring champion and playoff defeats (2008–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade dribbling the ball in 2009\nAfter months of rehab, he helped the U.S. National Team win gold at the 2008 Olympics, leading the team in scoring. Wade returned to the starting lineup to begin the 2008–09 campaign.[54][55] Early that season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to post at least 40 points, 10 assists and 5 blocks in one game since Alvan Adams in 1976–77.[56] Wade was elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star Game.[57]\n\n\nAfter the All-Star break, Wade recorded 50 points on 56.6% shooting along with 5 rebounds and 5 assists during a blow-out loss to the Orlando Magic;[58] making him the fourth in NBA history to score at least 50 points in a game that his team lost by at least 20.[58] In the very next contest, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and 7 rebounds.[59] Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring 50-plus points since Wilt Chamberlain.[60] Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record, scoring 24 points in the final quarter to secure a 120–115 win over the New York Knicks.[61] For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, plus 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocked shots.[61] In the next game he banked 40-points versus the Cleveland Cavaliers.[62] Wade put up 41 points on 53% shooting along with 9 assists, 7 steals, 7 rebounds and a block in the 107–100 loss.[62] The following game, Wade tied his career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, plus a steal and a block, as the Heat beat the Phoenix Suns 135–129.[63] Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with 30-plus points and 15 or more assists.[63] Less than a week later, Wade hit the buzzer-beater and tied his earlier franchise record with his 78th straight double-digit scoring game in double-overtime against the Chicago Bulls.[64] Wade finished the game with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes of play.[64] Wade joined Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to record that many points and that many assists in a single game while having as high of a field goal percentage.[65] Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning to become the Heat's all-time leading scorer in triple overtime versus the Utah Jazz.[66] Wade finished that 140–129 victory with 50 points to go along with his 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals and 2 blocks.[66]\n\n\nWade became the only player to reach 2,000 points, 500 assists, 150 steals, and 100 blocks as well as the only player under 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) to block upwards of 100 shots in a single season.[67][68] He became the fifth player to accumulate 2,000 points, 500 assists, and 150 steals in a season.[69] Wade helped the Heat clinch a playoff berth and become only the second team to make the postseason after winning 15 or fewer games the season before.[70] In a 122–105 victory over the New York Knicks, Wade recorded a career-high 55 points on 63% field goal shooting and added 9 rebounds and 4 assists.[71] Wade recorded 50 points in only three quarters and was pulled out of the game, one point shy of eclipsing Glen Rice's 56-point franchise record.[71] Wade averaged a league-leading 30.2 points for his first NBA scoring title. He added 7.5 assists, 5 rebounds, 2.2 steals, and 1.3 blocks.[47] Wade wrapped up the season with higher point, assist, steal, and block averages than James and Kobe Bryant, both of whom finished ahead of Wade in the MVP race.\n\n\nOn November 1, in what was only his third game of the 2009–10 season, Wade recorded his 10,000th career point during a 95–87 win against the Chicago Bulls.[72] On November 12, Wade made a spectacular dunk over Cavalier Anderson Varejão. James regarded the dunk as \"great, probably top 10 all-time\".[73] Two days later against the New Jersey Nets, Wade hit another buzzer beater for a one-point win at 81–80.[74] On January 6, Wade scored a season-high 44 points during an overtime loss to the Boston Celtics, the most in a losing effort that season.[75] Wade appeared in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game.[76] Wade was named the game's MVP with 28 points, 11 assists, 5 steals and 6 rebounds.[77]\n\n\nOn February 17, Wade strained his calf. He left the game, ending his personal and the Heat's franchise-record streak of 148 consecutive games with at least 10 points.[78] Wade was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for the fifth time and Player of the Week twice for his play in the month of March. He averaged 26.9 and 7.5 assists, both of which ranked third in the Eastern Conference, and 2.3 steals per game, which ranked first. Wade recorded six 30-point games and had six double-doubles in the month, including a season-high 14 assists.[79]\n\n\nFor the season, Wade averaged 26.6 points on 47.6% field goal shooting to go with 6.5 assists, 4.8 rebounds, 1.8 steals and 1.1 blocks; doing so, he led his team to a 47–35 record and the fifth playoff seed.[47] In the first round, down 0–3 against the Boston Celtics, Wade recorded a career playoff and franchise record with 46 points; he outscored the entire Celtics team in the fourth quarter.[80] It was Wade's sixth career playoff game with at least 40 points.[47] Despite his averaging 33.2 points on 56.4% shooting, 6.8 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1.6 blocks per contest, the Heat fell to Boston in five games.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Big Three era and back-to-back championships (2010–2014)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with his teammate LeBron James\nDuring the off-season, the Miami-Dade County commission renamed the area \"Miami-Wade County\" from July 1 to 7, a week that coincided with the start of free agency, intended to help convince Wade to stay with the Heat.[82] On July 7, it was announced that Wade would sign with Miami, along with Toronto Raptor star Chris Bosh.[83] The following day, LeBron James announced he would join the Heat.[84]\n\n\nIn the first year of the Big 3 Era, the Heat finished with a 58–24 record and earned the second seed in the Eastern Conference. Wade averaged 25.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 1.5 steals while shooting 50%.

Wade averaged 26.5 points, 7 rebounds, and 5.2 assists for the Finals and 24.5 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.4 assists for the playoffs.[85]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2012, Wade recorded the third triple-double in the history of the All-Star Game, posting 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, joining Jordan and James. On March 10, 2012, Wade made the game-winning shot against the Indiana Pacers, giving the Heat a 93–91 overtime win. Wade finished the season averaging 22.1 points, 4.8 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals. The Heat defeated the New York Knicks in 5 games and the Indiana Pacers in six games. In Game 6 of the second round, Wade recorded 41 points and 10 rebounds.[86] The Heat prevailed in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals, beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games. Wade averaged 22.6 points. The Heat became the first team in NBA history to win a championship after trailing in three playoff series.\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2012–13 season, Wade underwent left knee surgery, missing the 2012 Summer Olympics.[87][88] On December 26, 2012, playing the Charlotte Bobcats, Wade kicked guard Ramon Sessions in the groin. The following day, Wade was suspended by the NBA for one game.[89] Wade finished the 2012–2013 season with averages of 21.2 points, 5 rebounds and 5.1 assists.\n\n\nIn the playoffs, injuries limited Wade to a career-low scoring average of 15.9 points per game, but he upped his average to 19.6 points during the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. After the teams split the first two games in Miami, the Spurs took Game 3. In Game 4, Wade scored 32 points on 56 percent shooting to go with 6 steals as the Heat won 109–93. The Spurs took Game 5 despite Wade's 25 points and 10 assists. Wade scored 14 points in Miami's overtime win in Game 6, followed by 23 points and 10 rebounds in Game 7 as the Heat clinched their second straight championship and Wade's third title.[90][91]\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Wade missed 28 games from injuries and the team's decision to rest him during \"back-to-back\" games. Wade averaged 19 points and posted a career-high 54% field goal percentage. In the playoffs, the team increased Wade's minutes, highlighted by a 28-point performance in Miami's second-round victory over the Brooklyn Nets and a 23-point outing in a road victory against Indiana in the Eastern Finals. The Heat won the series in six games, advancing to their fourth straight NBA Finals. Wade averaged 19.1 points on 52 percent shooting, his best playoff percentage since 2010. The Heat lost to the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 NBA Finals in five games.\n\n\n\n#### Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade making a lay-up for the Heat in 2015\nOn June 28, 2014, Wade and teammates James and Bosh all opted out of their contracts in order to cut costs, but intended to re-sign.[92] James then announced that he was returning to Cleveland. Wade re-signed with the Heat,[93] joined by Bosh, Udonis Haslem, Chris Andersen and Mario Chalmers as well as former rivals Danny Granger and Luol Deng.\n\n\nIn the 2014–15 season, Wade missed seven consecutive games due to a hamstring injury.[94] On December 17, 2014, he scored a season-high 42 points, his highest total in almost four years, but Miami lost 105–87 to Utah.[95] He was again named an All-Star but pulled out due to another hamstring injury.[96] The Heat finished the season with a 37–45 record, as Wade missed the postseason for just the second time.\n\n\nOn June 29, 2015, Wade opted out of his contract,[97] but then signed a one-year, $20 million contract.[98] Wade hit just seven 3-point shots during the 2015–16 regular season. However, in the 2016 postseason, Wade converted on his first seven three-point shot attempts. Wade had never made more than five three-pointers in a row.[99]\n\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls (2016–2017)[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Wade joined his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls, on a two-year deal worth approximately $47 million.[100][101] Initially, the Heat offered a two-year, $20 million contract,[102] before increasing it to a two-year, $40 million offer, both of which Wade felt were unacceptable.[103][104] The relationship ended badly with Wade and the Heat squabbling.\n\n\nWade teamed with Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo in Chicago.[105] In January 2017, the trio were all fined for criticizing their young teammates' effort. In March 2017, Wade sustained a fractured elbow,[105] returning for the playoffs,[105] but the Bulls were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics in the first round.[106]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2017–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with the Cavs in 2017\nOn September 24, 2017, three months after trading Butler and waiving Rondo, the Bulls reached an agreement on a buyout with Wade.[105] Three days later, Wade signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, reuniting him with Miami Heat teammate LeBron James.[107] During the season, Wade objected to coach Tyronn Lue's plan to play him off the bench. Wade started for the Cavaliers in the first three games, but shot only 7-for-25. After a blowout loss to the Orlando Magic in the third game, Wade volunteered to take a bench role, becoming leader of the second unit.[108]\n\n\n\n### Return to Miami (2018–2019)[edit]\n\n\nOn February 8, 2018, at the NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster.[109] Acquiring guards Jordan Clarkson, George Hill and Rodney Hood, the Cavaliers[109] traded Wade back to the Miami Heat in exchange for a protected 2024 second-round draft pick.[110] At the funeral of Wade's long-time agent Henry Thomas in January, Wade mended relations with Riley. On February 9, in his first game, Wade was garnered a standing ovation and came off the bench in a 91–85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[111] On February 27, Wade scored a season-high 27 points as the Heat rallied to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 102–101. On April 3, in a 101–98 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Wade reached 5,000 assists in a Heat uniform, becoming the ninth player to score 20,000 points and collect 5,000 assists with one team, joining Karl Malone, Bryant, Jordan, James, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West.[112] On April 16, Wade scored 28 points to end the 76ers' 17-game winning streak and lead the Heat to a 113–103 Game 2 win over Philadelphia and even the first-round playoff series. He passed Larry Bird for 10th on the NBA's career postseason scoring list.[113]\n\n\nIn the off-season, Wade announced his intentions to retire after the 2018–19 season,[114][115][116] re-signing with the Heat on September 18.[117] He missed seven games in mid-November due to the birth of his daughter.[118] On November 25, Wade scored a season-high 35 points, the most ever by a Miami bench player.[119] On December 9, he scored 25 points in his 1,000th career game.[120] On January 6, 2019, Wade became the third player in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 5,000 assists, 4,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals, 800 blocks and 500 three-pointers.[121] Wade was named by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver as a special roster addition for the 2019 All-Star game, thus marking his 13th All-Star appearance.[122] Wade had received the second-most fan votes for guards in the Eastern Conference.[123] On April 9, Wade played his last home game in Miami, scoring 30 points.[124] In his final game the following night, Wade recorded his fifth career triple-double with 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.[125][126]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2020, the Heat announced that Wade's No. 3 jersey would be retired on February 22.[127]\n\n\n\n## NBA executive career[edit]\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Miami, Wade had discussed the potential for a future ownership stake in the Heat franchise but Wade was unable to commit at the time, according to Heat owner Micky Arison.[128]\n\n\nOn April 16, 2021, it was announced that Wade had purchased an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz franchise of the NBA, joining an ownership group led by his personal friend and associate, Ryan Smith, the Jazz majority owner and team governor. Wade is a member of a small ownership group that includes Smith, his wife Ashley, investor and Accel partner Ryan Sweeney, Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and the Miller family, which previously owned the team.[4]\n\n\n\n\n> \"This goes way beyond the dream I had to just play basketball in the NBA. I've seen Shaq do it in Sacramento. I've seen Grant Hill do it in Atlanta. I've seen Jordan do it in Charlotte. If this partnership is going to be anything like my relationship is with Ryan, there are going to be a lot of things that I'll want to be involved in. [...] Unfortunately, people in my community don't get this opportunity, and I do not take it lightly to have this opportunity. To make real change, this is where you have to be -- at the top -- and Ryan knows that. I'm thankful for him, and I know too that I bring a lot to this partnership outside of just my basketball knowledge and skills.\n> \n> — Dwyane Wade on purchasing an ownership stake in the Jazz[4]\n> \n\n\nWade said in the announcement of his purchase that he hoped to take a hands-on approach to his involvement, and highlighted his close brother-like relationship with Jazz star Donovan Mitchell, who he called the player most like him and \"2.0\".[4]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade shooting a free-throw against China during the 2008 Olympics\nWade was a member of the 2004 Olympic team, which won a bronze medal in Athens. The team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, in which Wade averaged 19.3 points per game.[129] The U.S. national team won a bronze medal.[130] Wade was named to the national team roster from 2006 to 2008; and, together with James and Anthony, Wade co-captained the 2006 team.[131]\n\n\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics, the United States went undefeated and captured gold medal honors after beating Spain, the 2006 World champions. Wade, who led the team in scoring, tallied a game-high 27 points in 27 minutes on 75% field goal shooting and added 4 steals, 2 assists, and 2 rebounds.[132] Wade averaged a team-high 16 points in 18 minutes on 67% field goal shooting, 4 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2.3 steals, as the U.S. lived up to their Redeem Team moniker and claimed gold medal honors for the first time since 2000.[132][133]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade's pre-game ritual consisted of doing pull-ups at the rim.\nListed at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall and weighing 220 pounds (100 kg), Wade was a shooting guard who could play point as he did during his rookie season and with smaller lineups. On offense, he was one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in NBA history. Wade's signature one-two step allowed him to dash past bigger defenders and draw fouls.[134] Wade ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. Wade was an unselfish player, averaging 5.4 assists for his career.[34] After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the league's premier clutch players.[135]\n\n\nDavid Thorpe, an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players, cited Wade's post-up game as one of his strengths.[136] Thorpe said that Wade's best moves from the post were his turnaround jump shot,[136] double pivot,[136] and what Thorpe termed a \"freeze fake\",[137] a pump fake Wade used to get his opponent to jump, so that he could drive around him.[137] Wade's main weakness was three-point shooting; he averaged 29% for his career.[34]\n\n\nWade was best known for his ability to convert difficult lay-ups, even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders.[134] His style drew concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner,[134] as Wade had hurt his knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players. Wade established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals.[138] He holds the NBA record for blocks by players listed 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and under, which he achieved in only 679 games; this is over 400 games less than the previous record-holder Dennis Johnson (1,100).[139]\n\n\nIn 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Wade as the 28th greatest player in NBA history.[140]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |

girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches in 2002. They split in 2007, and he divorced her in 2010 after an acrimonious court battle.[143] In 2011, Wade was granted sole custody of his two children.[144][145] Wade also raises a nephew, the son of Wade's sister Deanna.[146][147] Wade began dating actress Gabrielle Union in 2008.[148][149] According to Wade, he and Union briefly split up at some point early in 2013 due to career demands.[147] During that time, Wade and Aja Metoyer conceived a child.[150][151] Wade and Union became engaged in December 2013[152] and married on August 30, 2014, in Miami.[153] On November 7, 2018, Wade became a father for the fourth time, when he and Union welcomed their daughter, who was born via surrogate.[154] In 2020, Wade's 12-year-old child came out as a transgender girl and changed her name to Zaya.[155][156][157] During an April 2023 interview, Wade said that he moved his family out of Florida partially due to the state's anti-LGBTQ policies.[158][159]\n\n\nWade's nicknames include D-Wade and Flash, which was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O'Neal who would sing, \"He's the greatest in the Universe\", in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film *Flash Gordon*.[160][161] The Heat's 2005 NBA playoffs run and Wade's performances while O'Neal was hampered by injury, led to media attention and rapid increase in Wade's popularity. During those playoffs, Wade's jersey became the league's top-selling jersey and remained so for nearly two years.[162] After the Heat's success and Wade's memorable performances during the 2006 NBA playoffs, Wade appeared on several talk shows, including *Late Show with David Letterman* and *Live with Regis and Kelly*.[163] He also made a guest star appearance on Disney Channel's *Austin & Ally* as himself, who is an obsessed fan of Austin Moon.[164]\n\n\nWade has been featured in magazine articles and publications. In 2005, he was featured on *People*'s 50 Most Beautiful People,[165] and in 2006 he was named the NBA's best-dressed player by *GQ*.[166] In 2007, *Esquire* named him to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year.[167][168] Wade's endorsement deals included Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials paired him with Charles Barkley), and Topps.[169] He had his own line of shoes with Converse named \"The Wade\" and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile.[170][171] During the 2009–10 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike's Jordan Brand.[172] Wade was chosen by Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining Anthony and Chris Paul, who had their own signature shoes. After his Jordan Brand contract expired in 2012, Wade signed with the Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning.[173] Wade was included in *Time*'s list of the 100 most influential people of 2020.[174] In April 2021, Wade became a minority owner of the Utah Jazz.[175] In October 2021, Wade's eldest son, Zaire Wade got drafted by the Salt Lake City Stars, which is the NBA G League affiliate of the Utah Jazz.\n\n\nIn March 2021, when asked about Michael Jordan, Wade stated that Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. He explained, \"I come from a Jordan era. I am biased and I'm going to be biased until the day I pass away. Michael Jordan will be my GOAT. I'm not taking anything away from LeBron. LeBron is amazing. But Michael Jordan is my GOAT.\" Wade stated that Michael Jordan was his favorite player growing up. He explained, \"For me, from Chicago, where I grew up, I made it out the hood because I seen a dude, No. 23, play the game of basketball at a level that I was like, I just want to do some of that.\"[176][177]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade is active in encouraging youth to develop their talents as seen in this talent search at the Chicago Theatre.\nWade is well known for his philanthropic involvement. In 2003, he founded The Wade's World Foundation, which provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health, and social skills for children in at-risk situations.[178] He hosts a variety of community outreach programs in Chicago and South Florida.[178] In 2008, he announced his partnership with former teammate Alonzo Mourning's charitable foundation and co-hosted ZO's Summer Groove, an annual summer event.[179][180] On December 24, 2008, Wade purchased a new home for a South Florida woman whose nephew accidentally burned down the family home.[181] In addition, Wade donated furnishings, clothing and gifts to the family.[181]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wade giving a present to a U.S. Army reservist during a 2009 pregame ceremony\nAfter breaking his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's victory to 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan who lost his hands and feet due to a bacterial infection.[182] Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia.[182] Wade is known for visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid the media spotlight.[182]\n\n\nIn September 2009, Wade donated money from his foundation to keep the Robbins, Illinois public library from having to shut down.[183] He handed library director Priscilla Coatney a $25,000 check in order to resurrect the building. In January 2010, Wade and Mourning co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti\",[184] which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three days after the fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the \"Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti\" had already raised over $800,000.[184] Wade stated, \"I expected nothing less from my friends and colleagues in the sports community, our commitment to this cause knows no bounds, and we will continue to accept any and all donations throughout the days ahead.\"[184] Wade is also an avid supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and served as an Ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative.[185]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nWade is a Christian and chose the number 3 throughout most of his career because it represents the Holy Trinity.[186][187] His mother, Jolinda, strengthened her ties to Christianity in 2001 after years of drug problems. She served as a minister during her final prison sentence in 2002 and 2003. She was ordained as a Baptist minister in January 2007 and formed the non-denominational Temple of Praise Binding and Loosing Ministry in Chicago. In May 2008, Wade purchased a church building for his mother's ministry.[188] He tithes 10% of his salary to his mother's church.[15]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Wade appeared as a role model on Season 3, Episode 13, of *Supernanny* and gave advice to the family's son.\n\n\nIn 2019, Wade appeared as a guest judge on season 14 of *America's Got Talent* alongside wife Gabrielle Union.[189]\nIn 2021, it was said that Wade will be the host of *The Cube*, which is currently aired on TBS.\n\n\n\n### 2020 tweet[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Wade tweeted in support of Nick Cannon, who was fired from ViacomCBS after making racist remarks and endorsing antisemitic conspiracy theories.[190] Following some backlash, Wade later deleted his tweet and clarified that he had expressed his support of \"[Cannon's ownership of] the content and [the] brand he helped create\", and affirmed that he has \"zero tolerance for any hate speech.\"[191]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Basketball portal\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association franchise career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff free throw scoring leaders\n* List of Olympic medalists in basketball\n* History of the Miami Heat\n* 2002–03 Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"YouTube\". *www.youtube.com*.\n2. **^** \"YouTube\". *www.youtube.com*.\n3. **^** \"Dwyane Wade Stats\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

Hardaway played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Golden State Warriors, Miami Heat, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers. He was a five-time NBA All-Star and All-NBA Team selection. Hardaway won a gold medal with the United States national basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics. He was known for his crossover dribble which was dubbed the \"UTEP two-step\" by television analysts.\n\n\nHe is the father of current NBA player Tim Hardaway Jr.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was born in Chicago, Illinois, and he graduated from Carver Area High School in 1985.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway played college basketball for the UTEP Miners under head coach Don Haskins, a future member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nHardaway was twice named MVP of El Paso's Sun Bowl Invitational Tournament, in 1987 and 1988. He played on teams that went to the NCAA Tournaments in 1988 and 1989. He won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award in 1989 as the best college player in the nation six feet (1.83 m) tall or under. While playing for the Miners, Hardaway developed his crossover dribble move that was called the \"UTEP two-step\".[2]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

In his rookie season, Hardaway wore number *5* on his jersey, as Manute Bol wore Hardaway's *10*. After Bol left the Warriors, Hardaway acquired the number. Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin formed a trio known as Run TMC (the initials of the players' first names and a play on the name of the popular rap group Run-DMC). As part of the Warriors' attack, Hardaway was responsible for leading Run TMC's fast break, displaying his excellent passing and one-on-one skills to complement Richmond's slashing and Mullin's shooting.\n\n\nGolden State made the playoffs during the 1990–91 season, Hardaway's second season and his first season in the playoffs. In the first round, the 7th seeded Warriors defeated the 2nd seeded San Antonio Spurs led by All-Star David Robinson in 4 games to advance to face the 3rd seeded Los Angeles Lakers led by NBA legend Magic Johnson. The Warriors managed to steal a game on the road in game 2, but could not defeat the more experienced Lakers, falling in five games despite Hardaway averaging 26.8 points, 12.8 assists and 3.8 steals for the series.\n\n\nHardaway averaged a career-high 23.4 points a game in the 1991–92 season, as the Warriors fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. The following season Hardaway averaged a career-high 10.6 assists a game to get with his scoring average of 21.5, but the Warriors did not make the playoffs and would not return to postseason action for the remainder of Hardaway's tenure with the team.\n\n\nAs a Warrior, Hardaway made the NBA All-Star Game three straight years, and a knee injury kept him out of the entire 1993–94 season. He reached 5,000 points and 2,500 assists faster than any other NBA player except Oscar Robertson. Hardaway played for the Warriors until the middle of 1995–96 season when he was traded to the Miami Heat along with Chris Gatling in exchange for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1996–2001)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the mid-season trade to Miami, Hardaway started 28 games to finish the season, averaging 17.2 points a game with 10 assists. Miami made the playoffs but were swept in the first round by the 72 win Chicago Bulls. The following season was a huge success for Miami and for Hardaway, as he finished 4th in voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, was selected to the All-NBA First Team as Miami won a franchise record 61 wins.\n\n\nHardaway started in 81 games, averaging 20.3 points, 8.6 assists, while placing fourth in the league with 203 three-point baskets. He also played in the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, scoring 10 points in 14 minutes. In the playoffs, Hardaway averaged 26 points a game as the Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in the first round in 5 games, and then defeated the New York Knicks in 7 games in the semifinals, in which Hardaway scored 38 points in the 7th game. Miami would once again fall to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in 5 games.\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Hardaway averaged 18.9 points and 8.3 assist per game, and was selected to play in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Heat won 55 games and won the Atlantic Division, but lost to the Knicks in 5 games in the first round of the playoffs. In the lockout shortened 1998–99 season, he averaged 17.4 points a game with 7.3 assists, and Miami won the Atlantic Division again but could once again not defeat the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs despite having home court advantage and the Knicks being the 8th seed in the playoffs.\n\n\nHardaway's production slipped in the 1999–2000 season, with Alonzo Mourning and Jamal Mashburn carrying more of the offensive load. Hardaway averaged 13.4 points with 7.4 assists a game, but shot a personal best .367 percent from beyond the three-point arc. After playing just 52 games, Hardaway was further limited in the playoffs, as Miami defeated the Detroit Pistons but once again fell to New York in 7 games.\n\n\nThat summer, Hardaway and Mourning won a gold medal playing for the U.S.A. men's basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Before the 2000–01 season Mourning would be diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, and would be sidelined for much of the season. Hardaway upped his offensive production to 14.9 points a game with 6.3 assists a game as Miami won 50 games and captured the East's third best record, only to be swept in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\n\n\n### Dallas Mavericks (2001–2002)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2000–01 season, and with his skills declining with age, Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on August 22, 2001, for a second-round draft pick. He was at one time Miami's all-time leader in assists. With Dallas, Hardaway was mainly utilized off the bench, starting only two games out of 54 and averaging almost ten points a game. In the middle of the season, he was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for point guard Nick Van Exel.\n\n\n\n### Denver Nuggets (2002)[edit]\n\n\nWith the Nuggets he started all 14 games he played with them before retiring and becoming a basketball analyst for ESPN.\n\n\nWhile playing for the Nuggets, Hardaway was suspended for two games and fined $10,000 by the league when he threw a television monitor onto the court.[3]\n\n\n\n### Indiana Pacers (2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 2003, Hardaway signed a contract with the Indiana Pacers, and in his first game registered a season-high 14 points and seven assists against the Chicago Bulls. By the end of his career, Hardaway competed in five NBA All-Star Games.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### Detroit Pistons (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 7, 2014, it was announced that Hardaway was named an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons.[4]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was the 1989 WAC Player of the Year. He recorded 5,000 points and 2,500 assists, second fastest in NBA history after Oscar Robertson. Hardaway accomplished it in 262 games; Robertson took only 247.[5] He held the record for most assists in Miami Heat franchise history with 1,947,[5] until his total was surpassed by Dwyane Wade on January 16, 2010.\n\n\nHardaway shares the record for second most steals in an NBA playoffs game, with 8 in Game 2 of the 1991 Western Conference Semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers and in Game 4 of the 1992 Western Conference First Round against the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1991–92, Hardaway became the 7th player in NBA history to average 20 points (23.4 ppg) and 10 assists (10.0 apg) in a season, a feat he accomplished again in 1992–93 (21.5 ppg, 10.6 apg).[5]\n\n\nHardaway holds the NBA record for the worst single-game shooting performance in NBA history, going 0-for-17 in a 106–102 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 27, 1991.[6] Hardaway holds the Miami Heat's all-time record in 3-point field goals made, with 806. His number 10 was retired by the Miami Heat on October 28, 2009. On April 2, 2022, Hardaway was announced as one of thirteen members to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame for the Class of 2022 later this year.[7]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was originally selected to play for \"Dream Team II\" in the 1994 FIBA World Championship but was replaced after suffering a torn knee ligament.[8]\n\n\nHe was also selected (as one of the last two players selected) for the 1998 FIBA World Championship team. The team was later replaced with CBA and college players due to the NBA lockout.[9]\n\n\nIn 2000, he played in the Sydney Olympics, scoring 5.5 points/Game and shooting .385 (15–39) from the field.[10]\n\n\nHardaway was a player/head coach of the Florida Pit Bulls of the ABA in 2006.[11][12]\n\n\nIn September 2009, he played for the NBA Generations team in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge, a series of exhibitions against Korean Basketball League and Philippine Basketball Association players.[13]\n\n\n\n## Homophobia controversy[edit]\n\n\nDuring a February 14, 2007, interview on Miami's *The Dan Le Batard Show*, in response to the coming out of former NBA player John Amaechi, Hardaway remarked that he would try to distance himself from a player he knew was homosexual. When asked by the radio show host whether he realized that his remarks were homophobic, Hardaway responded by saying: \"Well, you know I hate gay people, so I let it be known. I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States.\" He also said that if he found out he had one or more gay teammates, he would try to get them fired.[14][15]\n\n\nLater in the day, Hardaway apologized for the remarks during a telephone interview with Fox affiliate WSVN in Miami. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said I hate gay people or anything like that.\"[16] He further apologized on February 15 in a statement released by his agent.[17]\n\n\nOn the same day, the NBA responded to Hardaway's comments by removing him from its All-Star Weekend activities later that week.[17] His employer, Trinity Sports, owner of the Anderson-based CBA Indiana Alley Cats, dismissed him from his position as Chief Basketball Operations Advisor,[18] and the CBA issued a statement distancing itself from Hardaway's remarks.[19]\n\n\nIn a September 2007 interview, Hardaway spoke about his February comments, saying he \"had no idea how much I hurt people. A lot of people.\" He described the controversy as \"the biggest bump [in the road] in my life\", and added, \"I'm going to do whatever I can to correct it. That's all I can do.\"[20]\n\n\nIn an interview on February 11, 2010, on Hardcore Sports Radio on Sirius, Hardaway spoke about his recent work with The Trevor Project and The YES Institute, which he has done to educate himself on LGBT issues.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2013, when Jason Collins came out as the first active openly gay male player in a major American professional team sport, Collins said that Hardaway called him in support of his homosexuality.[21] In July 2013, Hardaway was the symbolic first signer of a petition to put a proposed amendment to the Florida State Constitution overturning Florida Amendment 2 and allowing same-sex marriage in his home state of Florida on the ballot in 2014.[22]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway and his wife Yolanda reside in Michigan. They have a son, Tim Jr., and daughters, Nia and Nina.[5][23] Tim Jr. was drafted by the New York Knicks in 2013, and currently plays for the Dallas Mavericks.[24]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989–90 | Golden State | 79 | 78 | 33.7 | .471 | .274 | .764 | 3.9 | 8.7 | 2.1 | **.2** | 14.7\n |\n| 1990–91 | Golden State | **82** | **82** | 39.2 | **.476** | **.385** | .803 | **4.0** | 9.7 | **2.6** | .1 | 22.9\n |\n| 1991–92 | Golden State | 81 | 81 | **41.1** | .461 | .338 | .766 | 3.8 | 10.0 | 2.0 | **.2** | **23.4** |\n| 1992–93 | Golden State | 66 | 66 | 39.5 | .447 | .330 | .744 | **4.0** | **10.6** | 1.8 | .**2** | 21.5\n |\n| 1994–95 | Golden State | 62 | 62 | 37.4 | .427 | .378 | .760 | 3.1 | 9.3 | 1.4 | **.2** | 20.1\n |\n| 1995–96 | Golden State | 52 | 18 | 28.6 | .421 | .366 | .769 | 2.5 | 6.9 | 1.4 | **.2** | 14.1\n |\n| 1995–96 | Miami | 28 | 28 | 37.4 | .425 | .361 | .821 | 3.5 | 10.0 | 1.0 | **.2** | 17.2\n |\n| 1996–97 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 38.7 | .415 | .344 | .799 | 3.4 | 8.6 | 1.9 | .1 | 20.3\n |\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 37.4 | .431 | .351 | .781 | 3.7 | 8.3 | 1.7 | **.2** | 18.9\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 48 | 48 | 36.9 | .400 | .360 | .812 | 3.2 | 7.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 17.4\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | 52 | 52 | 32.2 | .386 | .367 | .827 | 2.9 | 7.4 | .9 | .1 | 13.4\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 77 | 77 | 33.9 | .392 | .366 | .801 | 2.6 | 6.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 14.9\n |\n| 2001–02 | Dallas | 54 | 2 | 23.6 | .362 | .341 | **.833** | 1.8 | 3.7 | .4 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Denver | 14 | 14 | 23.2 | .373 | .373 | .632 | 1.9 | 5.5 | 1.2 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2002–03 | Indiana | 10 | 0 | 12.7 | .367 | .355 | .500 | 1.5 | 2.4 | .9 | .0 | 4.9\n |\n| Career\n | 867 | 770 | 35.3 | .431 | .355 | .782 | 3.3 | 8.2 | 1.6 | .1 | 17.7\n |\n| All-Star\n | 5 | 0 | 16.8 | .386 | .381 | .786 | 2.6 | 4.6 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 10.6\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1991 | Golden State | 9 | 9 | 44.0 | **.486** | .354 | .789 | 3.7 | **11.2** | 3.1 | **.8** | 25.2\n |\n| 1992 | Golden State | 4 | 4 | 44.0 | .400 | .345 | .649 | 3.8 | 7.3 | **3.3** | .0 | 24.5\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 36.7 | .465 | .364 | .714 | 1.7 | 5.7 | 1.0 | .0 | 17.7\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | **17** | **17** | 41.2 | .359 | .313 | **.795** | **4.1** | 7.0 | 1.6 | .1 | 18.7\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 5 | 5 | **44.4** | .447 | **.436** | .784 | 3.4 | 6.6 | 1.2 | .0 | **26.0** |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 36.4 | .268 | .200 | .625 | 2.8 | 6.4 | 1.0 | .2 | 9.0\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 7 | 7 | 26.0 | .294 | .206 | .700 | 2.1 | 4.7 | .7 | .0 | 7.7\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 2 | 2 | 18.0 | .222 | .333 | .000 | 1.0 | 4.5 | .0 | .0 | 2.5\n |\n| 2003 | Indiana | 4 | 0 | 11.8 | .333 | .300 | .000 | .5 | 2.3 | .3 | .0 | 3.3\n |\n| Career\n | 56 | 52 | 36.6 | .393 | .320 | .751 | 3.1 | 6.8 | 1.6 | .2 | 16.8\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Tim Hardaway Stats\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

His profile on the official National Basketball Association (NBA) website states that \"by acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\"[10] He played fifteen seasons in the NBA, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing the sport of basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,[11] becoming a global cultural icon.[12]\n\n\nJordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick[5][13] and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players.[14] His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"**Air Jordan**\" and \"**His Airness**\".[5][13] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][13] During his professional career, he was also selected to play for the United States national team, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.[15]\n\n\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[13] He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game).[16] In 1999, he was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century.[5] Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career,[17] and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\").[18] He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009,[19] a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010,[20] and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a \"Dream Team\" member in 2017.[21][22] In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[23]\n\n\nOne of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements.[11][24] He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular.[25] He starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film *Space Jam* (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series *The Last Dance* (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. He is also the owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. In 2016, he became the first billionaire player in NBA history.[26] That year, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] As of 2023, his net worth is estimated at $3 billion by *Forbes*.[28]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMichael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in the Fort Greene neighborhood of New York City's Brooklyn borough on February 17, 1963,[29] to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.[29][30] He has two older brothers, James R. Jordan Jr. and fellow basketball player Larry Jordan, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn.[31][32] James Jr. became command sergeant major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the U.S. Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and retired in 2006.[33] In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina.[34] He attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.[35][36]\n\n\nMotivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.[35] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[36] Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, he averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.[37] As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points,[38][39] after averaging 27 ppg,[37] 12 rebounds (rpg),[40][41] and six assists per game (apg) for the season.[41][42][43] He was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[44] In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in cultural geography.[45]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nJordan going in for a slam dunk for the Laney High School varsity basketball team, 1979–80\n![](image)\nJordan in action for North Carolina in 1983\n\nAs a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[46] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[48][49] During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.[13]\n\n\nJordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons.[50][51] After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986,[52] when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.[53] In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[54]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early NBA years (1984–1987)[edit]\n\n\nThe Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.[55] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[56] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.[57]\n\n\nJordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub.[58] During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting,[46] and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.[59][60][61] Roy S. Johnson of *The New York Times* described him as \"the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls\" in November,[61] and Jordan appeared on the cover of *Sports Illustrated* with the heading \"A Star Is Born\" in December.[62][63] The fans also voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.[5] Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[5] This led to a so-called \"freeze-out\" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him.[5] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.[64] The Bulls finished the season 38–44,[65] and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[64]\n\n\nAn often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985,[37][66] when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk.[67][68] The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordan's rise.[68][69] The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers.[70][71] Jordan's 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.[72] The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record,[65] at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.[73] Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA Champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor’s single-game playoff scoring record.[74] A Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history swept the series in three games.[64][74][75]\n\n\nJordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season,[76] and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting.[46][77] In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.[78] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[79] The Bulls reached 40 wins,[65] and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Pistons roadblock (1987–1990)[edit]\n\n\nJordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,[46] and he won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, as he averaged 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg),[80] and led the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league.[81] The Bulls finished 50–32,[65] and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[82] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons,[64] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\".[83]\n\n\nIn the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 apg.[46] During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago's point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games, with averages of 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.[84]\n\n\nThe Bulls finished with a 47–35 record,[65] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way.[85] The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit \"The Shot\" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.[86] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,[64] by utilizing their \"Jordan Rules\" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[5]\n\n\nThe Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson.[87] On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers.[88] He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg,[46] in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.[65] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers;[89] despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[64]\n\n\n\n#### First three-peat (1991–1993)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan being defended by Mookie Blaylock (number 10) during a Bulls–Nets game in 1991\nIn the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.[46] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.[65] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them;[90] this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.[91]\n\n\nThe Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way.[90] Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket.[92] In his first Finals appearance, Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg.[93] Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award,[94] and he cried while holding the Finals trophy.[95]\n\n\nJordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from the 1990–91 campaign.[65] Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg, 6.4 rbg, and 6.1 apg on 52% shooting.[80] After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \"Air\" Jordan and Clyde \"The Glide\" during the pre-Finals hype.[96]\n\n\nIn the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.[97] After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: \"I can't believe I'm doing this.\"[98] The Bulls went on to win Game 1 and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row,[94] and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor.[99]\n\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting,[80][100] Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley,[79] which upset him.[101] Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,[102] and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.[94] He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games.[103] With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.[104]\n\n\n\n#### Gambling[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bulls' 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.[105] The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,[106] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course.[107] David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling,[108][109] but the rumor spread widely.[110]\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of *60 Minutes* and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: \n\n\n> Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.\n> \n> \n\n When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: \"No.\"[111] In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of *Jordan Rides the Bus*, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research \"convinced [him it] was nonsense\".[110]\n\n\n#### First retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1995)[edit]\n\n\nBaseball player\n\n\n\n| Michael Jordan |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Jordan in training with the Scottsdale Scorpions in 1994\n |\n| Birmingham Barons – No. 45, 35 |\n| **Outfielder** |\n| **Batted:** Right\n**Threw:** Right\n |\n| Professional debut |\n| **Southern League:** April 8, 1994, for the Birmingham Barons |\n| **Arizona Fall League:** 1994, for the Scottsdale Scorpions |\n| Last Southern League appearance |\n| March 10, 1995, for the Birmingham Barons |\n| Southern League statistics (through 1994) |\n| Batting average | .202 |\n| Home runs | 3 |\n| Runs batted in | 51 |\n| Arizona Fall League statistics |\n| Batting average | .252 |\n| Runs batted in | 8 |\n|  |\n| Teams |\n| * Birmingham Barons (1994–1995)\n* Scottsdale Scorpions (1994)\n |\n\n\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. Jordan later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision.[112] James R. Jordan Sr. was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus.[113][114] His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3.[114] Green and Demery were found after they made calls on James Jordan's cell phone,[115] convicted, and sentenced to life in prison.[116]\n\n\nJordan was close to his father; as a child, he imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket.[5] In 1996, he founded a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.[117][118] In his 1998 autobiography *For the Love of the Game*, Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.[119] The added exhaustion due to the \"Dream Team\" run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.[120]\n\n\nJordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[121] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31, 1994.[122] Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player.[123] The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.[124]\n\n\nIn 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 bases on balls, and 11 errors.[125][126] His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead. His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady.[127] He also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.[122] On November 1, 1994, his No. 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as *The Spirit* outside the new United Center.[128][129][130]\n\n\n\n#### Return to the NBA (1995)[edit]\n\n\nThe Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup[65] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs.[131] The 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March;[132] the team received help when Jordan decided to return to the Bulls.[133]\n\n\nIn March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike.[134] On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA in a two-word press release: \"I'm back.\"[135] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[136] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975.[137] Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No. 45, his baseball number.[136]\n\n\nDespite his eighteen-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.[64] Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic.[138] At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan \"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\",[139] and said that \"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to\".[140]\n\n\nJordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No. 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.[140] Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black.[141] He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs, but Orlando won the series in six games.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Second three-peat (1996–1998)[edit]\n\n\nJordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season.[143] The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3.[144] The Bulls eventually finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors.[145] Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg,[146] and he won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.[13]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship.[144] Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards;[94] he also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 1969–70 season.[64] Upon winning the championship, his first since his father's murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor.[5][95]\n\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, the Bulls stood at a 69–11 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season.[147] The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz.[148] That team included Karl Malone, who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957).[149][150][151] The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as \"The Flu Game\", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining.[148] The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games.[147] For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award.[94] During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, Jordan posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort, but the MVP award went to Glen Rice.[152]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan with coach Phil Jackson in 1997\nJordan and the Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the 1997–98 season.[65] Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg,[80] securing his fifth regular season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP.[13] The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks.[153][154] After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.[155]\n\n\nThe Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history.[156] With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting Utah's lead to 86–85.[156] The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands.[156]\n\n\nJordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul.[157][158][159][160] With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career,[161] a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead. Afterwards, the Jazz' John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship,[162] achieving a second three-peat in the decade.[163] Once again, Jordan was voted Finals MVP for a record sixth time,[94] having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg, including 45 in the deciding Game 6.[164] The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history,[165] and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.[166]\n\n\n\n#### Second retirement (1999–2001)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque at the United Center that chronicles Jordan's career achievements\nWith Phil Jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.[167][168][169] On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.[170] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.[171][172] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland)[173][174] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.[171][175]\n\n\nDespite his January 1999 claim that he was \"99.9% certain\" he would never play another NBA game,[95] Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team.[176][177] Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter,[178] Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.[179] Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.[176][177]\n\n\n\n### Washington Wizards (2001–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks.[180][181] In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg),[5] and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention;[182][183] he would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot.[184] After suffering torn cartilage in his right knee,[185] and subsequent knee soreness,[186] the Wizards missed the playoffs,[187] and Jordan's season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season.[46] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.[188] The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan as a member of the Washington Wizards, April 14, 2003\nPlaying in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.[189][190] That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them, and coming from off the bench in 15. He averaged 20.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 spg per game.[5] He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free-throw line.[46] Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times.[64] On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game.[191] During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road.[192] Jordan's final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.[193][194] At several points, he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of Kwame Brown, the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft.[193][194]\n\n\n\n#### Final retirement (2003)[edit]\n\n\nWith the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation.[195] The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.[196] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both;[197] in the end, he accepted the spot of Vince Carter.[198] Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia. After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \"We want Mike!\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.[199]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan on the \"Dream Team\" in 1992\nJordan made his debut for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal.[200][201] A year later, he won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.[202]\n\n\nIn 1992, Jordan was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the \"Dream Team\", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team went on to win two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas,[203] and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics. He was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics, averaged 14.9 ppg, and finished second on the team in scoring.[204] Jordan was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, winning all 30 games he took part in.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan dunking the ball, 1987–88\nJordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards,[13] and as a point guard.[84] Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.[205] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic.[206][207][208] Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as \"a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot\".[3] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization at game time.[209]\n\n\nNoted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee.[13][210] Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times.[13] Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.[211][212] Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special \"Love of the Game Clause\" written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.[213]\n\n\nJordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate. His 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history.[214] As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable.[215] Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career, Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg.[46] For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rpg. Defensively, he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg.[46]\n\n\nThree-point field goal was not Jordan's strength, especially in his early years. Later on in Jordan's career, he improved his three-point shooting, and finished his career with a respectable 32% success rate.[46] His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989–90 and 1996–97.[13] Jordan's effective field goal percentage was 50%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which consecutively (1988–1992); he also shot 51% and 50%, and 30% and 33% from the three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Chicago Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting.[13]\n\n\nUnlike NBA players often compared to Jordan, such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, who had a similar three-point percentage, he did not shoot as many threes as they did, as he did not need to rely on the three-pointer in order to be effective on offense. Three-point shooting was only introduced in 1979 and would not be a more fundamental aspect of the game until the first decades of the 21st century,[216] with the NBA having to briefly shorten the line to incentivize more shots.[217] Jordan's three-point shooting was better selected, resulting in three-point field goals made in important games during the playoffs and the Finals, such as hitting six consecutive three-point shots in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals. Jordan shot 37%, 35%, 42%, and 37% in all the seasons he shot over 200 three-pointers, and also shot 38.5%, 38.6%, 38.9%, 40.3%, 19.4%, and 30.2% in the playoffs during his championship runs, improving his shooting even after the three-point line reverted to the original line.[218][219][220]\n\n\nIn 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards, becoming the first NBA player to win both awards in a career let alone season. In addition, he set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard,[221] and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. He ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul.[222] Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.[223] Doc Rivers declared Jordan \"the best superstar defender in the history of the game\".[224]\n\n\nJordan was known to have strong eyesight. Broadcaster Al Michaels said that he was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away.[225] During the 2001 NBA Finals, Phil Jackson compared Jordan's dominance to Shaquille O'Neal, stating: \"Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion.\"[226]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Michael Jordan](image) | This article is part of a series aboutMichael Jordan |\n\n |\n| Career\n* Career achievements\n* The Shot\n* Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals\n* 1982 NCAA Championship Game\n* Air Jordan (Jumpman)\n* Jordan Rules\n |\n| Family\n* James R.

In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time.[230] Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders.[231] He scored 32,292 points in the regular season,[232] placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Bryant.[232]\n\n\nWith five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player in NBA history.[13][233] Jordan finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times.[13] He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[234] and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[23] Jordan is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[235] Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger,[236] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[237] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.[238]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Magic Johnson[5]\n\nMany of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.[223] In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century.[239] Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.[240] In addition, the Associated Press voted him the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.[241] Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of *Sports Illustrated* a record 50 times.[242] In the September 1996 issue of *Sport*, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.[243]\n\n\nJordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players.[244][245] Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while they were growing up.[246][247] In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players \"the next Michael Jordan\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade.[248][249][250] Some analysts, such as The Ringer's Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan's experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NBA; for Devine, it \"inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game's stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers\", such as Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Dončić, and James.[251] Don Nelson stated: \"I would've been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie.\"[252]\n\n\nAlthough Jordan was a well-rounded player, his \"Air Jordan\" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players,[244] a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: \"I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.\"[244] During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.[253] The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title.[253] As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.[254]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 \"Dream Team\"; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordan's short career in the Minor League Baseball.[255] After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.[256] As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack. In September, he was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč.[17] Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan's former coaches, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech when he began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the \"Crying Jordan\" Internet meme.[257][258] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] In October 2021, Jordan was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[23] In September 2022, Jordan's jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history.[259] In December 2022, the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy, named in Jordan's honor, to be awarded beginning with the 2022–23 season. The \"Michael Jordan Trophy\" will replace the original trophy, named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff, with a new Podoloff Trophy set to be awarded to the team with the best overall regular season record.[260][261]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of career achievements by Michael Jordan § NBA career statistics\n\nSee also: List of

He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.[282] Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.[283][284]\n\n\n\n### Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations.[285][286] Despite Jordan's previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.[287] A decade earlier, Jordan had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.[288]\n\n\nIn February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.[289] As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval.[290] On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team.[291] It also made him the league's only African-American majority owner.[292]\n\n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, *The New York Times* wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan had told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin: \"If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team.\"[293] Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan \"a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon\" for wanting \"current players to pay for his incompetence\".[294] He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.[294]\n\n\nDuring the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record. The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.[295] Before the next season, Jordan said: \"I'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating.\"[296]\n\n\nDuring the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim, retaining the majority of the team for himself,[297] as well as the role of chairman.[298] In 2023, Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake of the team to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner of the Hornets, although he is keeping a minority stake.[299] The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately $3 billion, more than 10 times the $275 million Jordan had paid for the team.[300]\n\n\n\n### 23XI Racing[edit]\n\n\nOn September 21, 2020, Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving, beginning competition in the 2021 season.[301] On October 22, the team's name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing (pronounced twenty-three eleven) and the team's entry would bear No. 23.[302] After the team's inaugural season, it added a second car with No. 45, driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023.[303][304] Ty Gibbs, John Hunter Nemechek, and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season.[305][306][307] The team fielded a third car, No. 67, driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500.[308] 23XI Racing has won four races, two by Wallace, one by Busch, and one by Reddick.[309][310]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama at the White House\nJordan's nephew through his brother Larry, Justin Jordan, played NCAA Division I basketball for the UNC Greensboro Spartans and is a scout for the Charlotte Hornets.[311][312]\n\n\nJordan married Juanita Vanoy at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on September 2, 1989.[313][314] They had two sons, Jeffrey and Marcus, and a daughter, Jasmine.[315] The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \"mutually and amicably\".[316][317] It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $254 million in 2023), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.[318][319]\n\n\nIn 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, where he planned to build a 56,000-square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion. It was completed in 1995. He listed the mansion for sale in 2012.[320] He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island, Florida.[321]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim.[322] Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.[323][324][325] Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.[322]\n\n\nJordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011,[326] and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[327][328] It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.[329][330] On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.[331] In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.[332]\n\n\n\n## Media figure and business interests[edit]\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan in 2008\nJordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.[333] Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the \"Be Like Mike\" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.[333][334]\n\n\nNike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984.[335] One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon. In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that \"it's gotta be the shoes\".[333] The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \"shoe-jackings\", in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the \"Jordan Brand\". The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.[336][337] The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.[338][339]\n\n\nJordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992's Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.[340] The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film *Space Jam*, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball.[341] They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.[341] Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Jam\" (1992).[342]\n\n\nSince 2008, Jordan's yearly income from endorsements is estimated to be over $40 million.[343][344] In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.[345] Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US$30 million per season.[346] An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.[347]\n\n\nMost of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.[348] Jordan has described Falk as \"the best at what he does\" and that \"marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan'.\"[349]\n\n\n\n### Business ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Jordan was ranked by *Forbes* as the 20th-most-powerful celebrity in the world, with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to *Forbes*, Jordan Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike.[350] In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.[351][352] On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the *Charlotte Business Journal'*s Business Person of the Year for 2014.[353] In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.[354]\n\n\n*Forbes* designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017.[355] From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan's 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, the most of any retired athlete.[356] As of 2023[update], his net worth is estimated at $3 billion by *Forbes*,[28] making him the fifth-richest African-American, behind Robert F. Smith, David Steward, Oprah Winfrey, and Rihanna.[357]\n\n\nJordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham, North Carolina, acquired in 1990,[358] and formerly had a Lincoln–Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009.[359][360] The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie, Maryland.[359] The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan's. Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York City's Grand Central Terminal, among others;[361] that restaurant closed in 2018.[362] Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course, Grove XXIII, under construction in Hobe Sound, Florida.[363]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings.[364]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational, that raised money for various charities.[365] In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.[366] The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.[367]\n\n\nThe Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008.[365] In 2013, he granted his 200th wish for the organization.[368] As of 2019, he has raised more than $5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.[365] In 2023, Jordan donated $10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday.[369]\n\n\nIn 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities.[370] In 2017, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, by giving $7 million, the biggest donation he had made at the time.[371] In 2018, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts.[372] He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas' recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019.[373]\n\n\nOn June 5, 2020, in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating $100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to \"ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education\".[374] In February 2021, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County, North Carolina, by giving $10 million.[375][376]\n\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\nJordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film *Space Jam*. The film received mixed reviews,[377] but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales.[378]\n\n\nIn 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled *Michael Jordan to the Max*.[379] Two decades later, the same period of Jordan's life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning *The Last Dance*, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020. *The Last Dance* relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's and his teammates' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used.[380][381] He was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir \"there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private\".[382]\n\n\nJordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single \"Franchise\" at his home in Highland Park, Illinois.[383] Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries *The Captain*, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.[384]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nJordan has authored several books focusing on his life, basketball career, and world view.\n\n\n\n* *Rare Air: Michael on Michael*, with Mark Vancil and Walter Iooss (Harper San Francisco, 1993).[385][386]\n* *I Can't Accept Not Trying: Michael Jordan on the Pursuit of Excellence*, with Mark Vancil and Sandro Miller (Harper San Francisco, 1994).[387]\n* *For the Love of the Game: My Story*, with Mark Vancil (Crown Publishers, 1998).[388]\n* *Driven from Within*, with Mark Vancil (Atria Books, 2005).[389]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes\n* List of athletes who came out of retirement\n* List of NBA teams by single season win percentage\n* Michael Jordan's Restaurant\n* *Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City*\n* *Michael Jordan in Flight*\n* *NBA 2K11*\n* *NBA 2K12*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jordan's weight fluctuated from 195 to 218 lb (88 to 99 kg) during the course of his professional career;[1][2][3] his NBA listed weight was 216 lb (98 kg).[4][5][6]\n2. **^** Jordan wore a nameless No. 12 jersey in a February 14, 1990, game against the Orlando Magic because his No. 23 jersey had been stolen.[7] Jordan scored 49 points, setting a franchise record for players wearing that jersey number.[8]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Telander, Rick (February 14, 2018). \"Michael Jordan Put on a Helluva Show at '88 All-Star Weekend\". *Slam*.

Jordan's return from three years of retirement has been remarkable, with five 40-point performances already. He is also rebounding and handing out assists on par with his career averages.

He is a 7-foot-1-inch (2.16 m) and 325-pound (147 kg) center who played for six teams over his 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is a four-time NBA champion. O'Neal is regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nAfter playing college basketball for the LSU Tigers, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid a feud between O'Neal and his teammate Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.[6] O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.[7]\n\n\nO'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award; the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award; 15 All-Star Game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards; three Finals MVP awards; two scoring titles; 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 8th all-time in points scored, 6th in field goals, 15th in rebounds, and 8th in blocks. O'Neal was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996.[8] Due to his ability to dunk the basketball and score from close range, O'Neal also ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%) and led the league in field goal percentage ten times.[9] O'Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.[10] He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017.[11] In October 2021, O'Neal was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[12]\n\n\nIn addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, *Shaq Diesel*, going platinum. O'Neal is also an electronic music producer, and touring DJ, known as DIESEL.[13] He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, *Shaq's Big Challenge* and *Shaq Vs.* He hosts *The Big Podcast with Shaq*.[14] He was a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings from 2013 to 2022 and is the general manager of Kings Guard Gaming of the NBA 2K League.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal playing for the Cole High School varsity basketball team in 1988–89\nO'Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey,[16] to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school basketball (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall. Toney struggled with drug addiction and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's Jamaican stepfather, Phillip Arthur Harrison, a career Army sergeant.[17][18] O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship.[18] On his 1994 rap album, *Shaq Fu: The Return*, O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song \"Biological Didn't Bother\", dismissing him with the line \"Phil is my father.\" However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O'Neal telling him, \"I don't hate you. I had a good life. I had Phil.\"[19]\n\n\nO'Neal came from a tall family. His father and mother were 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall, respectively, and by age 13, O'Neal was already 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall. He credited the Boys & Girls Clubs of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. \"It gave me something to do,\" he said. \"I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team.\"[20] Because of his stepfather's career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to military bases in Germany and Texas.[21]\n\n\nAfter returning from Germany, O'Neal's family settled in San Antonio, Texas. By age 16, O'Neal had grown to 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), and he began playing basketball at Robert G. Cole High School. He led his team to a 68–1 record over two years and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year.[22] His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification.[23] O'Neal's tendency to make hook shots earned comparisons to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, inspiring him to wear the same jersey number as Abdul-Jabbar, No. 33. However, his high school team did not have a *33* jersey, so O'Neal chose to wear No. 32 before college.[24]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school, O'Neal studied business at Louisiana State University (LSU). He had first met Tigers coach Dale Brown years earlier in Europe when O'Neal's stepfather was stationed on a U.S. Army base at Wildflecken, West Germany. While playing for Brown at LSU, O'Neal was a two-time All-American, two-time SEC Player of the Year, and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991; he was also named college player of the year by AP and UPI. O'Neal left LSU early to pursue his NBA career, but continued his education even after becoming a professional player.[25] He was later inducted into the LSU Hall of Fame.[26] A 900-pound (410 kg) bronze statue of O'Neal is located in front of the LSU Basketball Practice Facility.[27]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (1992–1996)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (1992–1993)[edit]\n\n\nThe Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. In the summer before moving to Orlando, he spent time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson.[28] O'Neal wore number 32 because Terry Catledge refused to relinquish the 33 jersey.[24] O'Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA, the first player to do so.[29] During his rookie season, O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season. He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985.[30] The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season, but missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers. On more than one occasion during the year, *Sports Illustrated* writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying, \"We've got to get [head coach] Matty [Guokas] out of here and bring in [assistant] Brian [Hill].\"[31]\n\n\n\n#### First playoff appearance (1993–1994)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993–1994, O'Neal's second season, Hill was the coach and Guokas was reassigned to the front office.[32] O'Neal improved his scoring average to 29.4 points (second in the league to David Robinson) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at 60%. On November 20, 1993, against the New Jersey Nets, O'Neal registered the first triple-double of his career, recording 24 points to go along with career highs of 28 rebounds and 15 blocks.[33] He was voted into the All-Star game and also made the All-NBA 3rd Team. Teamed with newly drafted Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway, the Magic finished with a record of 50–32 and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.[34] In his first playoff series, O'Neal averaged 20.7 points and 13.3 rebounds[35][*unreliable source*] as the Pacers swept the Magic.[36][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n#### First scoring title and NBA Finals (1994–1996)[edit]\n\n\nIn O'Neal's third season, 1994–95, he led the NBA in scoring with a 29.3 point average, while finishing second in MVP voting to David Robinson and entering his third straight All-Star Game along with Hardaway. They formed one of the league's top duos and helped Orlando to a 57–25 record and the Atlantic Division crown. The Magic won their first-ever playoff series against the Boston Celtics in the 1995 NBA Playoffs. They then defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinals. After beating Reggie Miller's Indiana Pacers, the Magic reached the NBA Finals, facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. O'Neal played well in his first Finals appearance, averaging 28 points on 59.5% shooting, 12.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists. Despite this, the Rockets, led by future Hall-of-Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, swept the series in four games.[37]\n\n\nO'Neal was injured for a great deal of the 1995–96 season, missing 28 games. He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game, made the All-NBA 3rd Team, and played in his 4th All-Star Game. Despite O'Neal's injuries, the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60–22, second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls, who finished with an NBA record 72 wins. Orlando easily defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the 1996 NBA Playoffs; however, they were no match for Jordan's Bulls, who swept them in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004)[edit]\n\n\n#### O'Neal–Bryant tandem buildup (1996–1999)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 8 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004), O'Neal won three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 and appeared in the 2004 NBA Finals.\nO'Neal became a free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the *Orlando Sentinel* published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning.[38][39] 82% answered \"no\".[38] O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill.[40][41] He said the team \"just didn't respect [Hill]\".[42] Another question in the poll asked whether O'Neal was worth $115 million, in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer; 91.3% of the response said it was not.[39][40] O'Neal's Olympic teammates teased him over the poll.[39][41] He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry.[38] O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to \"feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond\".[43] He also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him.[44]\n\n\nOn the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, the media announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121 million contract.[45][46] O'Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\"[47][48] The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season.[49] O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games.[50] In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The *Los Angeles Daily News* reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: \"It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.\"[51]\n\n\nThe following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61–21, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4–0 sweep.[52]\n\n\nWith the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar Kobe Bryant, expectations for the Lakers increased; however, personnel changes were a source of instability during the 1998–99 season. Long-time Laker point guard Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets; his former backcourt partner Eddie Jones was packaged with back-up center Elden Campbell for Glen Rice to satisfy a demand by O'Neal for a shooter. Coach Del Harris was fired, and former Lakers forward Kurt Rambis finished the season as head coach. The Lakers finished with a 31–19 record during the lockout-shortened season. Although they made the playoffs, they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs. The Spurs would go on to win their first NBA title in 1999.\n\n\n\n#### MVP and championship seasons (1999–2002)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal during Game 5 of the 2000 NBA Finals\nIn 1999, prior to the 1999–2000 season, the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach, and the team's fortunes soon changed. Jackson immediately challenged O'Neal, telling him \"the [NBA's] MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired.\"[53]\n\n\nIn the November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.[54] On March 6, 2000, O'Neal's 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123–103 win over the LA Clippers.[55] O'Neal's 61-point game is the most recent game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer.[56]\n\n\nO'Neal was also voted the 1999–2000 regular season Most Valuable Player, one vote short of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Fred Hickman, then of CNN, instead chose Allen Iverson, then of the Philadelphia 76ers who would go on to win MVP the next season. O'Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots. Jackson's influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O'Neal to defense, resulting in his first All-Defensive Team selection (second-team) in 2000.[57]\n\n\nIn the 2001 NBA Finals against the 76ers, O'Neal fouled out in Game 3 backing over Dikembe Mutombo, the 2000–2001 Defensive Player of the Year. \"I didn't think the best defensive player in the game would be flopping like that. It's a shame that the referees buy into that\", O'Neal said. \"I wish he'd stand up and play me like a man instead of flopping and crying every time I back him down.[58]\n\n\nA month before the 2001–02 season's training camp, O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot.[59] He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker.[60] He was ready for the start of the 2001–02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him.[59]\n\n\nIn January 2002, he was involved in a spectacular on-court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls. He punched center Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket, resulting in a melee with Miller, forward Charles Oakley, and several other players.[61] O'Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000.[62] For the season, O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, excellent statistics but below his career average; he was less of a defensive force during the season.[59]\n\n\nMatched up against the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 Western Conference finals, O'Neal said, \"There is only one way to beat us. It starts with c and ends with t.\" O'Neal meant \"cheat\" in reference to the alleged flopping of Kings' center Vlade Divac. O'Neal referred to Divac as \"she\", and said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul. \"I'm a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work.\"[63] \nAfter the 2001–2002 season, O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.[59]\n\n\nUsing Jackson's triangle offense, O'Neal and Bryant enjoyed tremendous success, leading the Lakers to three consecutive titles (2000, 2001, and 2002). O'Neal was named MVP of the NBA Finals all three times and had the highest scoring average for a center in NBA Finals history.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Toe surgery to departure (2002–2004)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal missed the first 12 games of the 2002–03 season recovering from toe surgery.[65] He was sidelined with hallux rigidus, a degenerative arthritis in his toe.[66] He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained, \"I got hurt on company time, so I'll heal on company time.\"[67] O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure.[66] The Lakers started the season with a record of 11–19.[68] At the end of the season, the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003.\n\n\nFor the 2003–04 season, the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of two aging stars—forward Karl Malone and guard Gary Payton—but due to salary cap restrictions, could not offer either player nearly as much money as he could have made with some other teams. O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season, O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. During a preseason game, O'Neal had yelled at Lakers owner Jerry Buss, \"Pay me.\"[69] There had been increasing tension between O'Neal and Bryant. The feud climaxed during training camp prior to the 2003–2004 season when Bryant, in an interview with ESPN journalist Jim Gray, criticized O'Neal for being out of shape, a poor leader, and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the team.[70]\n\n\nThe Lakers made the playoffs in 2004 and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter said, \"Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He's always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding\".[71] After the series, O'Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak regarding O'Neal's future with the club, as well as by the departure of Lakers coach Phil Jackson at the request of Buss. O'Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team's decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns, and O'Neal promptly demanded a trade. Kupchak wanted the Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki in return but Mavericks owner Mark Cuban refused to let his 7-footer go. However, Miami showed interest, and eventually the two clubs agreed on a trade.[72] Winter said, \"[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much.\"[73]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2004–2008)[edit]\n\n\n#### MVP runner-up (2004–2005)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Miami in 2007\nOn July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, and a future first-round draft choice (the Lakers used the draft choice to select Jordan Farmar in the 2006 draft). O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star Dwyane Wade, to whom he gave the nickname \"Flash\". With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. O'Neal made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference Player of the Month award for his performance in March. O'Neal also narrowly lost the 2004–05 MVP Award to Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash in one of the closest votes in NBA history.[74]\n\n\nDespite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference Finals and a Game 7 against the defending champion Detroit Pistons, losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O'Neal.[75] \nIn August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100 million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20 million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth championship (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\nIn the second game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities.[67] O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a \"frontrunner\" and a \"master of panic.\"[77] Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview \"Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game.\"[78] During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a .500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.[79]\n\n\n\nOn April 11, 2006, O'Neal recorded his second career triple-double against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists.[80] O'Neal finished the 2005–06 season as the league leader in field goal percentage.[80]\n\n![](image)O'Neal holding the championship ball when the NBA Champion Heat visited the White House\nIn the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2–0 lead in the series. Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3–1 series lead. The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat \nheld on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first-ever NBA Finals.[81]\n\n\nIn the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks led by Dirk Nowitzki, and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion. The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title. With Wade carrying the offensive load, O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Surgery and Wade's injury (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, O'Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery.[82][83] After one of those missed games, a Christmas Day match-up against the Lakers, he ripped Jackson, who O'Neal had once called a second father, referring to his former coach as \"Benedict Arnold\". Jackson had previously said, \"The only person I've ever [coached] that hasn't been a worker... is probably Shaq.\"[84] The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence,[85] but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team.[85] Critics doubted that O'Neal, now in his mid-30s, could carry the team into the playoffs.[86] The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.[85]\n\n\nIn a rematch of the year before, the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006–07 NBA playoffs. The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round.[87] It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006–07 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Career lows and disagreements (2007–2008)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007–08 season, averaging career lows in points, rebounds, and blocks. His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O'Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season.[9] O'Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15–game losing streak.[88] According to O'Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury.[89] During a practice in February 2008, O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal.[90] O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not \"all that good\" by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.[91]\n\n\nO'Neal played 33 games for the Miami Heat in the 2007–08 season prior to being traded to the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal started all 33 games and averaged 14.2 points per game. Following the trade to Phoenix, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points while starting all 28 games with the Suns.\n\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns (2008–2009)[edit]\n\n\nThe Phoenix Suns acquired O'Neal in February 2008 from the league-worst Miami Heat, who had a record at the time of the trade of 9–37, in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[92] O'Neal made his Suns debut on February 20, 2008, against his former Lakers team, scoring 15 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in the process. The Lakers won, 130–124. O'Neal was upbeat in a post-game press conference, stating: \"I will take the blame for this loss because I wasn't in tune with the guys [...] But give me four or five days to really get in tune and I'll get it.\"[93]\n\n\nIn 28 regular season games, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points and 10.6 rebounds,[94] good enough to make the playoffs. One of the reasons for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, especially after the Suns' six-game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs.[95] O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, but they were once again eliminated, in five games. O'Neal averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.[94]\n\n\nO'Neal preferred his new situation with the Suns over the Heat. \"I love playing for this coach and I love playing with these guys\", O'Neal said. \"We have professionals who know what to do. No one is asking me to play with [his former Heat teammates] Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis. I'm actually on a team again.\" Riley felt O'Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates. O'Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley, whom he often referred to as the \"great Pat Riley\" while playing for the Heat.[96] O'Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career.[97] They connected his arthritic toe, which would not bend, to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg. The trainers had him concentrate on building his core strength, flexibility, and balance.[98]\n\n\nThe 2008–09 season improved for O'Neal, who averaged 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks through the first half (41 games) of the season, leading the Suns to a 23–18 record and 2nd place in their division.[99] He returned to the All-Star Game in 2009 and emerged as co-MVP along with ex-teammate Kobe Bryant.\n\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Phoenix teammate Steve Nash\nOn February 27, 2009, O'Neal scored 45 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, his 49th career 40-point game, beating the Toronto Raptors 133–113.\n\n\nIn a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. \"I'm really too old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds\", O'Neal said, referring to the then 23-year-old Howard. \"It's not really my role anymore.\" O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. \"I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool\", said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was \"very disappointed cause [O'Neal] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.\"[100] O'Neal responded, \"Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching.\"[101] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since \"everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back.\"[102] In a 2006 interview in *TIME*, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would \"Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass.\"[103]\n\n\nOn March 6, O'Neal talked about the upcoming game against the Rockets and Yao Ming. \"It's not going to be man-on-man, so don't even try that,\" says O'Neal with an incredulous laugh. \"They're going to double and triple me like everybody else ... I rarely get to play [Yao] one-on-one ... But when I play him (on defense), it's just going to be me down there. So don't try to make it a Yao versus Shaq thing, when it's Shaq versus four other guys.\"[104]\n\n\nThe 2009 NBA Playoffs was also the first time since O'Neal's rookie season in 1992–93 that he did not participate in the playoffs. He was named as a member of the All-NBA Third Team. The Suns notified O'Neal he might be traded to cut costs.[105]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, 2009, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Sasha Pavlovic, Ben Wallace, $500,000, and a 2010 second-round draft pick.[106] Upon arriving in Cleveland, O'Neal said, \"My motto is very simple: Win a Ring for the King\", referring to LeBron James.[107] James was the leader of the team, and O'Neal deferred to him.[108] On February 25, 2010, O'Neal suffered a severe right thumb injury while attempting to go up for a shot against Glen Davis of the Boston Celtics.[109] He had surgery on the thumb on March 1 and returned to play in time for the first round of the playoffs.[110] After defeating the Chicago Bulls in the first round, the Cavaliers went on to lose to the Boston Celtics in the second round. In September 2016, O'Neal said: \"When I was in Cleveland, we were in first place. Big Baby [Glen Davis] breaks my hand and I had to sit out five weeks late in the year. I come back finally in the first round of the playoffs, and we lost to Boston in the second round. I was upset. I know for a fact if I was healthy, we would have gotten it done that year and won a ring.\"[111] O'Neal averaged career lows in almost every major statistical category during the 2009–10 season, taking on a much less significant role than in previous years.\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal finished his career with the Boston Celtics.\nUpon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O'Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Celtics, saw an opportunity to acquire O'Neal.[112] Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O'Neal would not receive preferential treatment, nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami.[113] On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal.[114] The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8 million.[115] O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal.[116] The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands.[117][118] He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.[119]\n\n\nO'Neal said he did not \"compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe.\" O'Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan: \"If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that.\"[120] Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected to be part of the second unit.[120] Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself.[121] O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg[122] including knee,[123] calf,[124] hip,[125] and Achilles injuries.[126] The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,[122] and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[127] After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf.[122][128] It was the last regular season game he would play that year.[129] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.[130][131]\n\n\nOn June 1, 2011, O'Neal announced his retirement via social media.[132][133] On a short video on Twitter, O'Neal tweeted, \"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.\" On June 3, 2011, O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement.[134]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nWhile in college, O'Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner.[135] His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament. While he led the Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup.\n\n\nHe was one of two players (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.[136]\n\n\nAfter his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition. He was angered by being overlooked for the 1999 FIBA AmeriCup squad, saying it was a \"lack of respect\".[137] He forwent an opportunity to participate in the 2000 Olympics, explaining that two gold medals were enough.[138] O'Neal also chose not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[139] He rejected an offer to play in the 2004 Olympics,[140] and although he was initially interested in being named for 2006–2008 US preliminary roster,[141] he eventually declined the invitation.[142]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal's free throw shooting was regarded as one of his major weaknesses.\nO'Neal established himself as an overpowering low post presence, putting up career averages of 23.7 points on .582 field goal accuracy, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game.\n\n\nAt 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m), 330 lb (150 kg)[143] and U.S. shoe size 23,[65] he became famous for his physical stature. His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents. On two occasions during his first season in the NBA, his powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports, prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.[144]\n\n\nO'Neal's \"drop step\", (called the \"Black Tornado\" by O'Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage slam dunk, proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time.[145] He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of nine.[65]\n\n\nOpposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[146]\n\n\nO'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.[147] O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80 percent in practice.[148] In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as \"Hack-a-Shaq\". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,[149] having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.[150]\n\n\nO'Neal only made one three-point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three-point-shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).\n\n\nO'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.[151]\n\n\nPhil Jackson believed O'Neal underachieved in his career, saying he \"could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons.\"[152] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named O'Neal as the 8th greatest player in NBA history.[153]\n\n\nThe Lakers retired his No. 34 jersey on April 2, 2013.[154] On February 26, 2016, the Miami Heat announced that it would retire O'Neal's No. 32 jersey during the 2016–17 season, making O'Neal one of just 32 athletes in American professional sports history to have their jersey retired by multiple teams.[155][156] The Heat eventually retired his jersey on December 22, 2016, during halftime of a game against his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n### Media personality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal in 1998\nO'Neal called himself \"The Big Aristotle\" and \"Hobo Master\" for his composure and insights during interviews. Journalists and others gave O'Neal several nicknames, including \"Shaq\", \"The Diesel\", \"Shaq Fu\", \"The Big Daddy\", \"Superman\", \"The Big Agave\", \"The Big Cactus\", \"The Big Shaqtus\", \"The Big Galactus\", \"Wilt Chamberneezy\", \"The Big Baryshnikov\", \"The Real Deal\", \"The Big Shamrock\", \"The Big Leprechaun\", \"Shaqovic\",[157][158] and \"The Big Conductor\".[159] Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press, O'Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking.[160] When he did not want to speak with the press, he employed an interview technique whereby, sitting in front of his cubicle, he would murmur in his low-pitched voice.[160][161]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike, O'Neal performed in a commercial for Disney. O'Neal was fined by the union for crossing the picket line.[162][163]\n\n\nO'Neal's humorous and sometimes incendiary comments fueled the Los Angeles Lakers' long-standing rivalry with the Sacramento Kings; O'Neal frequently referred to the Sacramento team as the \"Queens\".[164][165][166] During the 2002 victory parade, O'Neal declared that Sacramento would never be the capital of California,[167] after the Lakers beat the Kings in a tough seven-game series en route to its third championship with O'Neal.\n\n\nHe also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O'Neal told a reporter, \"you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so.\"[168] O'Neal later said it was locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but he said many Asians wouldn't see the humor.[169] Yao joked, \"Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with it when I was little.\"[170] O'Neal later expressed regret for the way he treated Yao early in his career.[171]\n\n\nDuring the 2005 NBA playoffs, O'Neal compared his poor play to Erick Dampier,[172] a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games. The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult. The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals.[173]\n\n\nO'Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, he responded, \"I'm sorry, who?\" and continued to pretend that he did not know who Bryant was until well into the 2005–06 season.[174]\n\n\nO'Neal also appeared on television on *Saturday Night Live* (he was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by Kelsey Grammer; however, he did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted *Shaq's Big Challenge*, a reality show on ABC in which he challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape.\n\n\nWhen the Lakers faced the Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify the end of the so-called \"Bryant–O'Neal feud\" that had festered since O'Neal left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend Bill Russell to make peace with Bryant.[175] On June 22, 2008, O'Neal freestyled a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O'Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a vasectomy, as part of a rhyme. He also taunted Bryant for not being able to win a championship without him. O'Neal led the audience to mockingly chant several times \"Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes\".[176] O'Neal justified his act by saying \"I was freestyling. That's all. It was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever. That is what MCs do. They freestyle when called upon. I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all.\"[177] Although even other exponents of hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg, Nas and Cory Gunz, agreed with O'Neal,[178] Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his intention to relieve O'Neal of his Maricopa County sheriff posse badge, due to \"use of a racially derogatory word and other foul language\".

Following his college basketball career at Georgetown University, his tenacity on defense twice earned him the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and twice placed him on the NBA All-Defensive Team. Mourning made a comeback after undergoing a kidney transplant and later won the 2006 NBA championship with the Heat. Mourning also played for the Charlotte Hornets and New Jersey Nets. On March 30, 2009, Mourning became the first Miami Heat player to have his number retired.[3] In 2010, Mourning was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In August 2014, Mourning was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and in August 2019 he was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDuring his time at Indian River High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, he led the team to 51 straight victories and a state title his junior year (1987). As a senior, he averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and 12 blocked shots per game. He was named Player of the Year by USA Today, Parade, Gatorade, and Naismith. He was the #1 recruit of the 1988 class, over Christian Laettner, Shawn Kemp, Billy Owens, Kenny Williams, Stanley Roberts, Rick Fox, and Malik Sealy, among others.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nMourning played college basketball for John Thompson at Georgetown University. He made an immediate impact as a freshman, starting all 34 games for the Hoyas, averaging 13.1 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. But his most notable accomplishment was leading the nation in total blocked shots (169) and blocks per game (5.0); both figures led the nation and set NCAA records for a freshman at that time.\n\n\nMourning's scoring and rebounding improved over the next two seasons, but his shot-blocking declined significantly, as his taller teammate Dikembe Mutombo established himself as starting center for Georgetown, forcing Mourning to play at power forward. After Mutombo entered the NBA draft in 1991, Mourning re-took his place as starting center, and responded with a spectacular senior season in 1991–92. He averaged 21.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 5.0 blocks per game that year, and collected numerous awards, including Consensus First-Team All-American and Big East Conference Player of the Year. He was also named Big East Defensive Player of the Year, which he had won twice previously (as a freshman in 1988–89, and again as a sophomore in 1989–90, sharing the award with Mutombo that season; Mutombo won the award alone in 1990–91).\n\n\nMourning finished his college career with 2,001 points and 1,032 rebounds, reaching the exclusive 2,000-point and 1,000-rebound milestone. More impressively, he finished with 453 blocked shots in his college career, ranking first all-time in NCAA history at that time. Interestingly, Mourning was never listed as the all-time leader in Georgetown history, as the school credits Patrick Ewing with 493 blocks during his college career,[4] but blocked shots were not an official NCAA statistic at that time.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Charlotte Hornets (1992–1995)[edit]\n\n\nMourning was selected second overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, behind Shaquille O'Neal and before Christian Laettner.[5] Mourning was named to the league's all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks. He finished second to Shaquille O'Neal in rookie of the year voting.[6] He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since David Robinson in the 1989–90 season to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104–103 victory in the game and a 3–1 victory in the series. The Hornets lost in the second round to the New York Knicks in five games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in nine playoff games. The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.\n\n\nIn the 1994–95 season, Mourning and teammate Larry Johnson led the Hornets to a 50-win season and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in scoring (21.3 per game), rebounding (9.9 per game), blocked shots (2.92 per game), and field goal percentage (.519), and played in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1995–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn November 3, 1995, after Mourning rejected Charlotte's contract extension offer worth an average of $11.2 million for seven years and knowing they would not be able to re-sign him, the Hornets traded him, along with reserves Pete Myers and LeRon Ellis in exchange for Glen Rice, Matt Geiger, Khalid Reeves and a first-round pick in the 1996 NBA draft.[7]\n\n\nMourning would immediately serve as the centerpiece of the Pat Riley-coached Heat, and in his first season in Miami he averaged 23.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game as Miami made the playoffs before being swept in the first round by the 72-win Bulls. Mourning played in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game and was joined by All-Star point guard Tim Hardaway who arrived through a mid-season trade.\n\n\nIn July 1996, Mourning signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Heat.[8] In the 1996–97 season, the Heat would go on to win a then franchise-record 61 games, finishing second in the Eastern Conference behind the defending champions Bulls, while Mourning averaged 19.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the Orlando Magic in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where the rivalry between the Heat and the New York Knicks intensified. The Knicks took a 3–1 series lead, but following a brawl between Charlie Ward and P. J. Brown late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down. Mourning scored 28 points in Game 6, followed by a 22-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 to help Miami advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, a franchise first, to face Chicago. The Bulls took a 3–0 series lead, and Mourning guaranteed a victory in Game 4 as the Heat won 87–80.[9] However, with a 100–87 loss in Game 5, the Heat were eliminated by the Bulls.\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Mourning played 58 games and averaged 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game as the Heat won 55 games. However, Miami lost in the first round to the Knicks, with Mourning missing the deciding Game 5 due to a suspension caused by a fight between Mourning and former teammate Larry Johnson in Game 4.[10] The brawl also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was seen dangling on Mourning's leg in an attempt to break up the fight.[11] The following season, the Heat won 31 games in a lockout-shortened 50-game schedule, and Mourning won his first of two consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards after leading the league in blocks with 3.9 per game. Despite finishing with the best record in the Eastern Conference, the Heat once again fell short to the Knicks in the first round, with Allan Houston securing the series victory with a last-second jumper in Game 5.[12][13] Mourning again led the NBA in blocks in the 1999–2000 season, this time with a 3.7 average, and won Defensive Player of the Year. Miami finished the regular season with 52 wins and faced the Knicks in the second round. But for a third straight season, the Heat lost to the Knicks in a winner-take-all game, this time in Game 7.[14]\n\n\nShortly after playing for the gold medal-winning U.S. national team in the 2000 Summer Olympics, Mourning was diagnosed with a serious kidney disease.[15] Initially deemed out for the remainder of the season, Mourning returned for the final 13 games, helping the Heat win 50 games despite playing limited minutes. However, Miami was swept 3–0 in the first round by the Hornets.[16] In the 2001–02 season, Mourning played 75 games and averaged 15.7 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game, earning his final All-Star nod. Despite that, the Heat missed the playoffs with a 36–46 record. Mourning missed the entire 2002–03 season as he continued to deal with a serious kidney disorder, and without their star center, the Heat won only 25 games and missed the playoffs again.[17]\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nMourning signed a four-year deal with the New Jersey Nets in July 2003 as a free agent.[18][19] On November 24, 2003, after appearing in 12 games, Mourning retired from the NBA due to complications from his kidney disease.[20][21] On December 19, he underwent a successful kidney transplant.[22] In 2004, he started practicing with the Nets again, and made the team's regular season roster during the 2004–05 season. He did not play a significant role with the Nets, however, and openly complained to the media that he wanted out of New Jersey, especially after the team traded away Kenyon Martin.[23][24] After playing in just 30 total games for New Jersey, Mourning, Eric Williams and Aaron Williams were traded to the Toronto Raptors for Vince Carter on December 17, 2004.[25][26] Mourning never reported to the Raptors, and was bought out of his contract at a remaining $9 million on February 11, 2005. Raptors team officials later said that he did not meet the medical conditions to play for the team.[27][28][29] Mourning then finished the season with the Heat being paid a second salary, the veteran's minimum.[30]\n\n\n\n### Return to the Heat (2005–2008)[edit]\n\n\nMourning re-signed with the Heat on March 1, 2005.[31] His role was reduced as a backup because of superstar Shaquille O'Neal, although he was called upon as a starter due to O'Neal missing stretches due to injury. O'Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning's tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the first seed in Eastern Conference during the 2004–05 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest. Miami swept the Nets in the first round of the playoffs, with Mourning recording 21 points and nine rebounds in just 16 minutes in Game 2. In the second round against the Washington Wizards, Mourning stepped in for the injured O'Neal and scored 14 points with 13 rebounds and blocked four shots in Game 3 as Miami completed another four-game sweep. Miami fell in seven games to the defending champions, the Detroit Pistons, in the Eastern Conference Finals, with Mourning leading the team in blocks with three per game for the series.\n\n\nOn June 17, 2005, the Heat picked up the team option on Mourning,[32] as the Heat once again overhauled their roster, acquiring other veterans seeking a title such as Antoine Walker and Gary Payton.[33][34] Mourning continued to serve as the Heat's backup center, and early on stepped in to serve as the team's starting center after O'Neal suffered an injury. Mourning started in 20 games out of a total of 65 games played, averaging 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds, while finishing third in the league with 2.7 blocks per game despite playing as a reserve. In the playoffs, Mourning continued to shine in his role as a defensive player off the bench, as Miami advanced past the Bulls and the Nets before defeating the Pistons in six games to advance to the 2006 NBA Finals, the first NBA Finals in franchise history and the first for Mourning. After a 2–0 deficit, Miami won all three of its home games led by the spectacular play of Dwyane Wade, and in Game 6 in Dallas, Mourning came off the bench to score eight points with six rebounds and a team-high five blocks to help Miami win its first NBA championship in franchise history.\n\n\nAfter winning the championship, Mourning announced that he would return to the Heat in the 2006–07 season to defend their title, despite receiving offers of more money from other teams, including the San Antonio Spurs.[35] In 2007, Mourning announced he would return for one more year with the Heat and his 15th season. \"It will definitely be my last year\", Mourning said.[36] After starting the season on a solid note averaging 6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.75 blocks in just over 16 minutes played per 24 games,[37] Mourning tore his patellar tendon in his right knee[38] on December 19, 2007, during the first quarter of the 117–111 overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[39][40]\n\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, he became the Heat's all-time leader in points scored (which has since been surpassed by Dwyane Wade).[41]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nMourning announced his retirement from the NBA on January 22, 2009. In his press conference he said, \"At 38 I feel like I've physically done all I can for this game.\"[42][43] One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning's number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored.[3] The jersey retirement ceremony occurred on March 30, 2009, when the Heat hosted the Orlando Magic. During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor Charlie Crist; former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson; Basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing; Heat players Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem; and Heat head coach Pat Riley.[44][45]\n\n\nIn May 2009, he was named to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches, and administrators who contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia. In the following April, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding high school, collegiate, and professional career as well as his commitment to volunteer service in the communities in which he has lived and worked throughout his life.[46]\n\n\nMourning announced his return to the Heat in late June 2009; he holds the position of vice president of player programs and development, which covers community outreach and mentoring young players.[47]\n\n\nMourning played in a basketball game for Barack Obama's 50th birthday at the basketball court at the White House in 2011. In addition to Mourning, the game featured Shane Battier, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Maya Moore, Joakim Noah, Chris Paul and Derrick Rose and Obama's friends from high school. Kobe Bryant and Bill Russell were spectators.[48]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2014, it was announced that Mourning would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 8.[49][50][51]\n\n\nOn March 26, 2019, Mourning was named to the FIBA Hall of Fame,[52] and was inducted on August 30.[53][54]\n\n\nIn 2021, to commemorate the NBA's 75th anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all-time, and named Mourning as the 69th greatest player in NBA history.[55]\n\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* 3-time NBA champion: 2006 (as a player), 2012, 2013 (as vice president of player programs)\n* 7-time NBA All-Star: 1994–1997, 2000–2002\n* All-NBA First Team: 1999\n* All-NBA Second Team: 2000\n* 2-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year: 1999, 2000\n* 2-time NBA All-Defensive First Team: 1999, 2000\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team: 1993\n* J.

Funds are allocated toward research for a cure, education for doctors and the general public, testing for early detection and a fund for those not able to afford medication.\n\n\nIn 2007, Mourning along with Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, and Cal Ripken Jr. founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.[58]\n\n\nIn 2003, he also founded the Overtown Youth Center for underprivileged kids, located in Miami, Florida. The program aims to inspire, empower, and enrich these children while teaching them to become positive contributing citizens.\n\n\nIn 2009, the Miami-Dade school board named a new high school in North Miami, Florida, in his honor, Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMourning and his ex-wife Tracy have three children.[59] Like his father, his oldest son, Trey Mourning played for the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team, wearing his father's signature number 33 jersey. They resided in Pinecrest, Florida, where Mourning purchased a two-story, 9,786-square-foot residence for $4.5 million in 2012.[60] On June 26, 2019, Trey was included on the Miami Heat roster for the 2019 NBA Summer League,[61] and was later selected second overall by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA G League in the 2019 NBA G League draft.[62]\n\n\nIn July 2011, Mourning was sued by Miami-based lawyer Spencer Aronfeld on behalf of Alberto Candoleria for crashing his car into another car and then leaving the scene of the accident. The Florida Highway Patrol later charged Mourning with leaving the scene of a car accident. The accident allegedly occurred after he left Chris Bosh's wedding in Miami Beach after 3:00 a.m. Candoleria had just been in an accident when Mourning struck his car.[63][64][65]\n\n\nIn 2015, Mourning was one of eight Virginians honored in the Library of Virginia's \"Strong Men & Women in Virginia History\" for his charitable work and for his contributions to the sport of basketball.[66]\n\n\n\n### Kidney transplant[edit]\n\n\nOn November 25, 2003, Mourning's cousin and a retired U. S. Marine, Jason Cooper, was visiting Mourning's gravely ill grandmother in the hospital. Mourning's father was present and informed Cooper that Mourning was retiring that day from the NBA because of a life-threatening kidney disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the same problem that Sean Elliott had in 1999. Cooper asked if there was anything he could do, and began to contemplate donating one of his kidneys to his estranged cousin, whom he had not seen in 25 years and whom he only knew through basketball. Cooper was tested for compatibility, along with many other family members and friends (including fellow NBA center and good friend Patrick Ewing); during his grandmother's funeral, Mourning received the news that Jason Cooper was a match.[67][68]\n\n\nMourning received Cooper's left kidney on December 19, 2003.[66][68]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992–93 | Charlotte | 78 | **78** | 33.9 | .511 | .000 | .781 | 10.3 | 1.0 | .3 | 3.5 | 21.0\n |\n| 1993–94 | Charlotte | 60 | 59 | 33.6 | .505 | .000 | .762 | 10.2 | 1.4 | .5 | 3.1 | 21.5\n |\n| 1994–95 | Charlotte | 77 | 77 | **38.2** | .519 | .324 | .761 | 9.9 | 1.4 | .6 | 2.9 | 21.3\n |\n| 1995–96 | Miami | 70 | 70 | **38.2** | .523 | .300 | .685 | 10.4 | **2.3** | **1.0** | 2.7 | **23.2** |\n| 1996–97 | Miami | 66 | 65 | 35.2 | .534 | .111 | .642 | 9.9 | 1.6 | .8 | 2.9 | 19.8\n |\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 58 | 56 | 33.4 | .551 | .000 | .665 | 9.6 | .9 | .7 | 2.2 | 19.2\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 46 | 46 | 38.1 | .511 | .000 | .652 | **11.0** | 1.6 | .7 | **3.9\\*** | 20.1\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | **79** | **78** | 34.8 | .551 | .000 | .711 | 9.5 | 1.6 | .5 | 3.7\\* | 21.7\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 13 | 3 | 23.5 | .518 | .000 | .564 | 7.8 | .9 | .3 | 2.4 | 13.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Miami | 75 | 74 | 32.7 | .516 | **.333** | .657 | 8.4 | 1.2 | .4 | 2.5 | 15.7\n |\n| 2003–04 | New Jersey | 12 | 0 | 17.9 | .465 | .000 | **.882** | 2.3 | .7 | .2 | .5 | 8.0\n |\n| 2004–05 | New Jersey | 18 | 14 | 25.4 | .453 | .000 | .593 | 7.1 | .8 | .3 | 2.3 | 10.4\n |\n| 2004–05 | Miami | 19 | 3 | 12.9 | .516 | .000 | .564 | 3.7 | .2 | .2 | 1.7 | 5.0\n |\n| 2005–06†\n | Miami | 65 | 20 | 20.0 | **.597** | .000 | .594 | 5.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.7 | 7.8\n |\n| 2006–07 | Miami | 77 | 43 | 20.4 | .560 | .000 | .601 | 4.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.3 | 8.6\n |\n| 2007–08 | Miami | 25 | 0 | 15.6 | .547 | .000 | .592 | 3.7 | .3 | .2 | 1.7 | 6.0\n |\n| Career\n | 838 | 686 | 31.0 | .527 | .247 | .692 | 8.5 | 1.1 | .5 | 2.8 | 17.1\n |\n| All-Star\n | 4 | 1 | 18.8 | .545 | .000 | .667 | 4.8 | 1.0 | .8 | 2.0 | 10.0\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993 | Charlotte | 9 | 9 | 40.8 | .480 | .000 | .774 | 9.9 | 1.4 | .7 | **3.4** | **23.8** |\n| 1995 | Charlotte | 4 | 4 | **43.5** | .421 | **.500** | **.837** | **13.3** | **2.8** | .8 | 3.3\\* | 22.0\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 30.7 | .486 | .000 | .714 | 6.0 | 1.3 | .7 | 1.0 | 18.0\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | 17 | **17** | 37.1 | .491 | .375 | .555 | 10.2 | 1.1 | .6 | 2.7\\* | 17.8\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 4 | 4 | 34.5 | .518 | .000 | .655 | 8.5 | 1.3 | .8 | 2.5 | 19.3\n |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 38.8 | .521 | .000 | .653 | 8.2 | .8 | **1.6** | 2.8 | 21.6\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 10 | 10 | 37.6 | .484 | .000 | .667 | 10.0 | 1.4 | .2 | 3.3\\* | 21.6\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 30.3 | .480 | .000 | .579 | 5.3 | 1.0 | .0 | 1.7 | 11.7\n |\n| 2005 | Miami | 15 | 2 | 16.9 | .705 | .000 | .558 | 4.8 | .3 | .3 | 2.2 | 6.1\n |\n| 2006†\n | Miami | **21** | 0 | 10.8 | .703 | .000 | .667 | 2.9 | .1 | .2 | 1.1 | 3.8\n |\n| 2007 | Miami | 4 | 0 | 13.8 | **.909** | .000 | .385 | 2.0 | .3 | .0 | .8 | 6.3\n |\n| Career\n | 95 | 57 | 27.3 | .512 | .368 | .649 | 7.0 | .9 | .5 | 2.3 | 13.6\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Mourning to head player development\". *ESPN.com*.

A Texas Mr. Basketball in high school, he played one season of college basketball for Georgia Tech before declaring for the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\nWhile at Toronto, Bosh became a five-time NBA All-Star, was named to the All-NBA Second Team once, played for the U.S. national team (with whom he won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics), and supplanted former fan favorite Vince Carter as the face and leader of the Raptors franchise. In the 2006–07 season, Bosh led the Raptors to their first playoff appearance in five years and their first-ever division title. He left Toronto in 2010 as the franchise's all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, and minutes played.[1]\n\n\nIn 2010, after seven seasons with the Raptors, Bosh entered into a sign-and-trade deal whereby he was traded to the Miami Heat.[2] In Miami, he joined fellow stars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James; the trio became known as the Big Three. Bosh spent the second half of his career with Miami, appearing in the NBA Finals each year from 2011 to 2014 and winning NBA titles in 2012 and 2013. He made the NBA All-Star team every year during his time in Miami. Bosh's career was cut short by a blood clotting condition that the NBA ruled to be a career-ending illness.[3][4] He played his final NBA game on February 9, 2016.[5] Notwithstanding the NBA's ruling, Bosh fought to resume his playing career for three years[6] before announcing in February 2019 that he intended to retire.[7] The same year, the Heat retired his No. 1 jersey.[8][9] In 2021, Bosh was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\nSeeking to promote sports and education amongst youths in Dallas and Toronto, Bosh set up the Chris Bosh Foundation and regularly speaks to youths about the benefits of reading.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn to Noel and Freida Bosh in Dallas, Texas,[11] Bosh was raised in Hutchins, a suburb of the city.[12] A family-oriented person, Bosh would often play basketball in the house with his younger brother, Joel.[13] At the early age of four years old, he started learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym where his father played pick-up games.[14] Since Bosh was always tall for his age, he was accustomed to out-rebounding his peers whenever he played;[15] but he only started learning the game of basketball seriously around fourth grade, doing so at a playground near his grandmother's house.[13]\n\n\nAs a child, Bosh participated in karate and gymnastics.[16] He also played baseball up until high school, chiefly as a first baseman according to his preference.[13]\n\n\nGrowing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influence on his personality and considers NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, after whom he modeled his play.[15] Academically, Bosh always excelled in school[17] as he was a member of the National Honor Society and several student engineering organizations.[16]\n\n\nBosh began garnering significant attention from college recruiters after he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and to the *USA Today* National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.[18]\n\n\nThe 6-foot-11 teenager helped Lincoln High capture the Class 4A state title as he delivered 23 points and 17 rebounds to go along with 9 blocks. Bosh was subsequently named High School Player of the Year by Basketball America; Powerade Player of the Year in Texas; a first-team All-American by *Parade*, McDonald's, and EA Sports; a second-team all-American by *USA Today* and *SLAM* Magazine; a first-team all-state player; and \"Mr. Basketball\" in Texas by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches.[18] With his combination of grades and basketball skills, Bosh's name was on a number of college recruiting lists. The University of Florida and University of Memphis among them made serious overtures, but it was Paul Hewitt, coach of Georgia Tech, who made the best impression. Bosh felt that Hewitt had his best interests at heart and respected his aspiration to play professionally; moreover, he was sufficiently impressed by what he saw of Georgia Tech's transition offense.[17]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nBosh eventually chose to follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management.[13] There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so.[11] Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, but by the end of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA.[17] He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season[11] and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career.[15]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors (2003–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh shooting a free throw during a game in the 2005–06 season\n#### Rookie year (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nIn what is widely regarded as one of the strongest draft classes in NBA history, which included future All-Stars LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade,[17] Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in the 2003 NBA draft and was signed on July 8, 2003.[19] Prior to his signing, however, other NBA teams made offers for Bosh as they knew Toronto needed a veteran scorer, and Raptors star Vince Carter himself pressed for a trade. General Manager Glen Grunwald turned everyone down.[17]\n\n\nIn his rookie season, Bosh was forced to play out of position as the Raptors' starting center after Antonio Davis was traded to the Chicago Bulls.[20] Night after night, the teenager with the \"slim frame\" battled against opponents who had a significant size and strength advantage over him.[20] Bosh—who cited teammate Michael Curry as his mentor[15]—was often praised by his coaches for his heart, and willingness to play through pain and injuries resulting from his lack of body strength compared to some of the league's strong forwards and centers.[21] Bosh's contributions were not unnoticed by teammates either,[22] as he averaged 11.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and 33.5 minutes in 75 games, leading all rookies in rebounding and blocks, and setting a franchise record for most rebounds in a rookie season with 557.[11] Bosh was rewarded by being selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2003–04 season.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Heralded as the new hope (2004–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh and his teammates in a 2005–06 game against the Milwaukee Bucks. From left: Pape Sow, Bosh, Mike James and Morris Peterson.\nWith the departure of the disenchanted franchise face of the team, Vince Carter, in December 2004, Bosh was simultaneously anointed as the new leader around whom Toronto would build.[23] In the remaining games following Carter's departure, the power forward averaged 18.4 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 38.1 minutes per game, improving in every major statistical category.[11] He was awarded his first ever NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played between January 3 and 9, 2005.[11] As the season drew to a close, analysts predicted that Bosh would become an All-Star one day.[24][25] Bosh ended the 2004–05 season as the leading scorer and leading rebounder for the team on 21 and 46 occasions respectively.[11]\n\n\nPrior to the 2005–06 season, Bosh was named as one of Toronto's team captains. Bosh continued to work on his game as he consistently chalked up double-doubles, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage for the first half of the season.[26] On February 9, 2006, for the first time in his career, Bosh was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference.[11] He was only the third Raptor to make an All-Star game, after Carter and Antonio Davis. Bosh's selection was just three days after he was named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career.[26] In March 2006, following a season-ending injury to Bosh,[27] the Raptors hit a 1–10 skid.[28] This highlighted Bosh's importance as the centerpiece of the offense, as well as the leader of the team. The Raptors finished the season 27–55 and Bosh averaged 22.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.[29]\n\n\n\n#### Leader of the division champions (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh improved his numbers in ppg and rpg in the 2006–07 season and had to lead a vastly different team from the 2005–06 roster.\nDespite a major off-season revamp of the Raptors roster—including the departure of good friends Mike James and Charlie Villanueva—Bosh officially signed a three-year contract extension with a player option for a fourth year on July 14, 2006.[30][31] The deal was reportedly worth US$65 million over four years.[32] Upon signing the contract, Bosh said \"I think the future is very positive for the franchise... change was needed... we have a lot of guys who just want to win and are willing to work hard.\"[32] During the same press conference, Bosh also announced a donation of $1 million to a Toronto charity, known as Community Legacy Programs.[30]\n\n\nAfter a shaky start to the Raptors' 2006–07 campaign, the Raptors managed to surpass the .500 mark as the All-Star break approached.[33] Bosh's play and leadership were pivotal to this run and as an increasing recognition of his abilities, on January 25, 2007, he was named an All-Star starter for the East in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. Bosh received the second highest number of votes among all Eastern Conference forwards.[34] This was his first All-Star start and second overall All-Star appearance, having averaged over 22 points and 11 rebounds in the first half of the season.[34] On January 31, 2007, in a game against the Washington Wizards, Bosh scored a 65-foot (20 m) buzzer-beating shot to end the third quarter of the game.[35] He shot 15-of-15 after missing his first four shots.[36] Bosh's in-form streak enabled him to be selected Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January 2007.[37] He had averaged 25.4 points and 9.1 rebounds while leading the Raptors to a 10–5 record in that month. On February 7, 2007, Bosh's career-high 41 points prompted the home fans to chant \"MVP\"—an unprecedented event in the Air Canada Centre.[38] Two days later, Bosh collected 29 points and 11 rebounds against the Los Angeles Lakers, shooting 10-of-10 in the second half.[39]\n\n\nOn March 28, 2007, Bosh became the new franchise record holder for double-doubles in a home win against the Miami Heat.[40] He was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the third time in his career shortly after,[41] having led Toronto to clinch a playoff berth for the first time in five years. Toronto went on to win its first ever division title, and concluded the regular season with a 47–35 record, including a 30–11 home record, both franchise records.[42] As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in the first round of the 2007 NBA playoffs. The series drew much media attention as Carter, who had left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances, was back at the ACC as a Net.[43] Toronto's inexperience was evident as they struggled offensively throughout the game, to eventually lose 96–91.[43] The Raptors won game 2 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds.[44] The Nets won Games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5.[45] The Nets went on to clinch the series with a win in game 6.[46] Bosh averaged a double-double with 22.6 ppg and 10.7 rpg for the regular season, both career-highs, and posted 17.5 ppg and 9.0 rpg for the playoffs.[29] He was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Struggles (2007–2009)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2007\nBefore the 2007–08 season began, Andrea Bargnani, the number one pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was slated to start at center and Bosh at power forward to form a strong Toronto frontcourt and Jason Kapono, a three-point specialist, was acquired via free agency from the Miami Heat to add offensive firepower; however, as the season unfolded, neither plans materialized as hoped.[48] Bosh himself had a slow start to the season, but as mid-season approached, his form picked up and he was named Player of the Week for the second week of January.[49] On January 31, 2008, he was selected to be on the Eastern Conference team for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game.[50] Bosh missed 15 games throughout the season, but the Raptors still managed to conclude the regular season with a 41–41 record, thus clinching the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 NBA playoffs. However, they were defeated by the Orlando Magic in the first round, losing 4–1.[51]\n\n\nThe first-round series against the Magic was touted as the matchup between two of the league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard.[52] Howard dominated throughout the series, while Bosh had a series-best effort in game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds.[53] General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, \"Whether it's protecting [Bosh] inside the paint, getting a little bit more of a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better\", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul.[54] Bosh said after the loss, \"They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good.\"[51] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.[55]\n\n\nTo provide Bosh with an experienced frontcourt partner, the Raptors pulled a blockbuster trade prior to the 2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers.[56] Bosh—who had won an Olympic gold medal with the national team at Beijing 2008—started the season strong. He averaged 26 points, 10 rebounds and 3.7 assists in his first three games and was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the fifth time in his career.[57] A week later, he became Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds, surpassing Antonio Davis's record.[58] While Bosh and O'Neal formed a formidable partnership in the frontcourt, the Raptors struggled to surpass the .500 mark. The principal deficiency of previous campaigns—wing players—continued to upend Toronto's progress.[59] With the Raptors at 8–9, head coach Sam Mitchell was sacked and replaced by Jay Triano.[60] Despite the move, injuries and weaknesses in the roster meant that the Raptors entered the All-Star break 13 games under .500.[61] On January 29, 2009, Bosh was named an All-Star reserve,[62] but an injury ruled him out of the game. Two weeks later, in a bid to bring in a wing player and create greater salary flexibility, O'Neal and Jamario Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[61] The trade did not improve the team's win–loss record, however, and the Raptors were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining.[63] The bright spark in Bosh's campaign was his career-high 22.7 points per game, as well as his being one of two players in the league that season (the other being Dwight Howard) to average a 20/10 in points and rebounds.[64] On April 20, 2009, Colangelo announced that he would offer Bosh a contract extension during the summer,[65] which Bosh later refused to sign.[66]\n\n\n\n#### Overhauling the roster (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nTo prepare for the 2009–10 season, Bosh worked out under Ken Roberson, looking to add 20 pounds (9 kg) and bring his weight up to 250 lb (110 kg).[66] Following the failure of the 2008–09 campaign, Colangelo knew that he had to shake up the roster to persuade Bosh to stay, and the Raptors were one of the busiest teams in the pre-season market.[67] They opened their season with a win against the heavily favored Cleveland Cavaliers, in which Bosh scored 21 points and pulled down 16 rebounds.[68] Bosh went on a tear, averaging 25.4 points and 11.9 rebounds in the first 16 games, but the Raptors were only able to win seven of those games.[68][69] The Raptors crossed into 2010 with a 16–17 record, and on January 3, 2010, Bosh overtook Vince Carter as Toronto's all-time leader in total points scored.[70] After pulling together a string of wins, Toronto were .500 after 40 games. Bosh was the league leader in double-doubles at the time, being only one of two players in the league who averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game.[71] On January 20, 2010, he scored a career-high 44 points in a loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, while collecting his 220th career double-double.[72] That same month, Bosh was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team,[73] and was Eastern Conference Player of the Week.[74] After the All-Star break, the Raptors went on several losing streaks and an injury to Bosh exacerbated the situation. As the regular season came to a close, the Raptors went from being the fifth seed before the All-Star break to fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot with the Chicago Bulls. After recording his 44th double-double on March 22, 2010, Bosh became the Raptors' all-time leader in number of double-doubles in a season. On April 5, 2010, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, winning the honor for the seventh time in his career (tying Carter for the most in franchise history).[75] However, Bosh was unable to play in a pivotal match against the Bulls on April 11, 2010. The blowout loss cost Toronto their tie-breaker and ultimately the eighth seed, as the Bulls finished with 41 wins to Toronto's 40.[76]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2010–2017)[edit]\n\n\n#### Joining the Heat and debut season (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2010\nAfter the 2009–10 season was over, there was much speculation over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. Bosh signed with the Miami Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal, which sent two 2011 first-round draft picks to the Raptors (Norris Cole and Jonas Valančiūnas were later selected).[77][78] Bosh was a part of the first player-created NBA superteam.[79] Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, \"[K]now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me. I've loved every minute here and I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart...\"[80] Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, he was one of only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.[81]\n\n\nDespite being widely tipped as contenders, the Heat got off to a tentative 9–8 start. The Heat managed to go on to compile a 21–1 record, however, and were jostling with the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls for pole position in the Eastern Conference as mid-season approached.[82] Miami finished the regular season with 58 wins and faced Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs. Miami won the series in five games, and also prevailed in five games in the semi-finals against Boston. In the Conference Finals against Chicago, Bosh was particularly instrumental, averaging 23.2 points in the 4–1 series win. He was slow off the blocks in the Finals against Dallas, shooting below .300 in the first two games, but scored the winning shot in game 3 to give Miami a 2–1 lead. That was the last game Miami won, as Dallas won the next three to win its first-ever championship. Bosh was seen sobbing as he walked to the locker room following the loss.\n\n\n\n#### Consecutive NBA championships (2011–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in a layup line before a game against the Dallas Mavericks in 2012\nOn January 5, 2012, Bosh led the Heat to a 116–109 triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks, highlighted by a three-point shot he made to force the game into overtime with 0.6 seconds left to play in the fourth quarter. Bosh finished the game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocked shots.[83] By season's end, the Heat had embraced a small-ball strategy that featured Bosh at the center position. In the playoffs, Bosh averaged 14.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a game. In game 1 of the Conference Semi-finals against the Indiana Pacers, he suffered a lower abdominal strain that forced him to miss the rest of the series and the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston. Bosh returned in the Conference Finals against the Celtics. He was moved to center for the remainder of the playoffs, while James, who had filled in at power forward during his absence, remained at that position.[84][85] Boston pushed Miami to seven games, and in the final game, Bosh scored 19 points, including 3-of-4 shooting from three-point range, to help the Heat advance to their second straight NBA Finals, this time against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder won the first game of the series before Miami rolled to a 4–1 victory, giving Bosh his first NBA championship. Bosh scored 24 points in the deciding game 5 and averaged 14.6 points and 9.4 rebounds in the Finals.\n\n\nBosh remained the Heat's starting center during the 2012–13 season. On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra.[86] The Heat achieved the league's best record and swept through the first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in five games, with Bosh scoring 20 points to go with 19 rebounds in a crucial game 3 win in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs, as the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven-game series against Indiana. The Heat and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs blew out Miami in game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead. In game 4, Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to complement Wade's 32 points and James's 33 points to bolster the Heat's win, tying the series. San Antonio would bounce back in game 5 to force the Heat to win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide-open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA championship.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Coming up short (2013–2014)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Bosh played and started in 79 games, averaging 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He also hit a career-high 74 three-point shots on 33 percent shooting from beyond the arc. In the playoffs, Bosh helped the Heat return to the NBA Finals, where they faced the San Antonio Spurs once again. This time, however, the Heat were outclassed by the Spurs, as they lost the series in five games.\n\n\n\n#### Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 30, 2014, after wide speculation that he would join the Houston Rockets, Bosh re-signed with the Heat to a five-year, $118 million contract after LeBron James announced he was leaving Miami to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[88][89] After averaging 21.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals over the first 23 games of the 2014–15 season, Bosh was ruled out indefinitely on December 15 with a strained calf.[90] He went on to miss eight games before returning on December 29 against the Orlando Magic.[91] After playing in the 2015 All-Star Game, Bosh was admitted to a Miami hospital for lung tests during the All-Star break.[92][93] On February 21, 2015, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a blood clot in one of his lungs.[94]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2015, Bosh made his return to the court in the Heat's season opener against the Charlotte Hornets, recording 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 104–94 win.[95] On November 10, 2015, he scored a then season-high 30 points in a 101–88 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[96] On December 28, 2015, he recorded 24 points and 12 rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets, and hit a career-best 5-of-5 from three-point range.[97] On January 4, 2016, he recorded a season-high 31 points and 11 rebounds in a 103–100 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers.[98] Though he was voted to play in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, and selected to compete in the Three-Point Contest, due to a calf injury, Bosh was forced to withdraw from both.[99]\n\n\nA blood clot in his leg again forced Bosh to miss time following the 2016 All-Star break. He faced increasing pressure from physicians and the Heat organization to sit out the rest of the season because of the potential dangers of the recurring medical condition.[100] Following the Heat's February 9 game against San Antonio, Bosh did not play any regular-season or playoff games for Miami in 2016.[3][101][102] On May 4, 2016, the Heat announced that Bosh would be held out for the remainder of the playoffs.[3]\n\n\n\n#### Comeback attempts and retirement (2016–2019)[edit]\n\n\nBosh was initially optimistic about a return to the Heat for the 2016–17 season, and the organization had become increasingly hopeful that he would be cleared for camp. Those hopes quickly faded due to Bosh's continued issues with blood clotting.[103] In September 2016, Bosh failed his physical exam and was not cleared by the team to participate in training camp.[104] On September 26, 2016, Heat president Pat Riley said that the team viewed Bosh's career with the team as over.[105] In May 2017, Bosh and the Heat reportedly reached a unique agreement in which Bosh would leave the Heat without his salary taking up the team's salary cap space for the 2017–18 season.[106]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2017, the NBA ruled that Bosh's blood clotting issues were a career-ending illness, meaning the Heat would be allowed to remove his contract from their salary cap once they officially released him.[4] Two days later, the Heat announced that they had waived Bosh, ending a seven-year stint with the organization.[107] Following Bosh's release, Heat President Pat Riley said, \"The number '1' will never be worn by another player and we can't wait to someday hang his jersey in the rafters\".[108] In February 2018, Bosh declared himself on the comeback trail, having refused to rule out a return to the NBA.[6][109]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2019, Bosh announced that he was no longer pursuing his NBA career[110] and that he planned to retire from the NBA when his jersey was retired by the Heat.[111] The Heat retired Bosh's No. 1 jersey on March 26 before a regular season game against the Orlando Magic.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|

when he was selected as a member of the 2002 USA Basketball Junior World Championship Qualifying Team that finished with a 4–1 record and the bronze medal.[112]\n\n\nAfter his NBA career began, Bosh was named in March 2006 to the 2006–2008 United States men's national basketball team program, and helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour.[112] In August 2006, Bosh was named as a member of the 2006 USA World Championship Team.[112] Together with fellow 2003 draftees Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kirk Hinrich, this team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal, defeating former 2004 Olympic champion Argentina.[113] Bosh was ranked sixth in field goal percentage.[112]\n\n\nFollowing the 2006–07 season, Bosh was named to the team that would compete in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. However, he sustained a foot injury and withdrew from the squad.[114] On June 23, 2008, he was named to the team that would compete in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.[115] During the tournament itself, Bosh operated as the main backup to center Dwight Howard as Team USA went unbeaten in all eight games en route to the gold medal, defeating Spain in the final.[116] He averaged 9.1 points per game, and led the team in rebounds with 6.1 a game.[117]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Bosh withdrew his name from consideration for the 2012 Olympics in London to recover from a lower abdominal strain that kept him out of some playoff games.[118]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> You are not going to see a whole lot of screaming and hollering at guys... He is a guy that is going to pull somebody aside and say it in a positive way, and I think it goes a lot farther that way.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAnthony Parker on Bosh's leadership[119]\n\n![](image)The mid-range jump shot was one of Bosh's trademark moves.\nBosh traditionally played the power forward position, including during his first season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) and 235 pounds (107 kg),[29] Bosh possessed excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size.[120] He was particularly noted for his ability to drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he was also proficient, but he was also known for his well-developed jump shot.[121] Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: \"We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work either. I don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth.\"[122] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions.[123] He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left.[124] It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his \"arrival\" to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime.[11] When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot .343 from the three-point arc for the season; he improved to .400 the following season.[29] Because of his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.\n\n\nBosh was noted for his leadership. When he was the leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to maintain his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic.[121] However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who made bad calls on the court.[125] Throughout his career, comparisons were made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.\n\n\n\n## Honors and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* **NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Month**: January 2007\n* **9× NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week**: January 3, 2005; January 30, 2006; March 26, 2007; January 7, 2008; October 28, 2008; February 1, 2010; April 5, 2010; December 23, 2013; October 28, 2014\n* **NBA Atlantic Division champion**: 2007\n* **4× NBA Southeast Division champion**: 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n* **2× NBA champion**: 2012, 2013\n* **11× NBA All-Star**: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016\n* **All-NBA Second Team**: 2007\n* **NBA All-Rookie Team**: 2004\n* **2× NBA Rookie All-Star Game**: 2004, 2005\n* **3× NBA Shooting Stars champion** (with Swin Cash and Dominique Wilkins) 2013, 2014, 2015[126]\n* Bronze medal winner with Team USA at the 2006 FIBA World Championship\n* Gold medal winner with Team USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics\n* Third-youngest player in NBA history to record 1,000 rebounds[11]\n* Fourth-youngest player in NBA history to record 20 points and 20 rebounds in a game[11]\n* Toronto's first player to achieve 10,000 points\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in defensive rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds per game\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds per game in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in blocks\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws made[127]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws made in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws attempted[127]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws attempted in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in double-doubles[40]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in double-doubles in a season\n* NBA Sportsmanship Award (divisional winner): 2007–08[128]\n* Elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh at the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards\nBesides his on-the-court exploits, Bosh was a National Honor Society member and graduated with honors from Lincoln.[14] He is also a member of the National Society of Black Engineers and the Dallas Association of Minority Engineers.[14] Following his success in the NBA, Bosh soon had his own YouTube channel,[129] and has since made various TV appearances. In December 2009, First Ink, a DVD featuring comedic digital shorts and a documentary about Bosh, was released. The DVD was filmed during the summer of 2009.[130] A fan of the *X-Men* television series as a child, Bosh voiced the Marvel Comics character Heimdall in an episode of *Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.* in 2014.[131][132] He also made appearances on episodes of *Entourage* and *Parks and Recreation*.[133]\n\n\nIn the field of philanthropy, Bosh established the Chris Bosh Foundation in 2004. Remembering the challenges he faced as a youth,[14] Bosh founded the organization to help younger people in academics and athletics.[134] The Foundation, with programs in Toronto and Dallas, has worked closely with organizations such as the Toronto Special Olympics to raise important funding for community projects.[14] Bosh's mother, Freida, has served as CEO of the Foundation.[134] As an avid reader, Bosh also regularly speaks to groups of children about the benefits of reading,[12] and has received the NBA Community Assist Award for his active contributions for the Raptors community development program in Toronto and Dallas during the course of the NBA campaign.[135] In November 2008, Bosh pledged to donate $75,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada.[136] He is also an advocate for increased computer literacy in schools, supporting the non-profit code.org.[137]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2011, Bosh married Adrienne Williams.[138][139] They renewed their vows on July 16, 2011.[140] The couple have five children, three sons and two daughters.[141][142]\n\n\nBosh has dabbled in hip-hop production. In 2017, alongside record producer, songwriter, and singer Rico Love, Bosh co-produced a song titled \"Miss My Woe\" by Gucci Mane.[143] The song is featured on Gucci's 11th studio album titled, *Mr. Davis*.\n\n\nIn June 2021, Bosh published his book, *Letters to a Young Athlete.*[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n### Paternity lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nOn March 24, 2009, it was reported that Bosh's former girlfriend, Allison Mathis, was seeking child support and sole custody of their daughter, Trinity (born November 2, 2008). Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home.[147] Three days later, it was reported that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid.[148] Mathis' lawyer also told the press, \"My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything on our side... She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to have a good relationship with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult.\"[148]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* Toronto Raptors accomplishments and records\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chiari, Mike. \"Chris Bosh on NBA Career: 'I've Made the Decision Not to Pursue It Anymore'\". *Bleacher Report*.

A Texas Mr. Basketball in high school, he played one season of college basketball for Georgia Tech before declaring for the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\nWhile at Toronto, Bosh became a five-time NBA All-Star, was named to the All-NBA Second Team once, played for the U.S. national team (with whom he won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics), and supplanted former fan favorite Vince Carter as the face and leader of the Raptors franchise. In the 2006–07 season, Bosh led the Raptors to their first playoff appearance in five years and their first-ever division title. He left Toronto in 2010 as the franchise's all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, and minutes played.[1]\n\n\nIn 2010, after seven seasons with the Raptors, Bosh entered into a sign-and-trade deal whereby he was traded to the Miami Heat.[2] In Miami, he joined fellow stars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James; the trio became known as the Big Three. Bosh spent the second half of his career with Miami, appearing in the NBA Finals each year from 2011 to 2014 and winning NBA titles in 2012 and 2013. He made the NBA All-Star team every year during his time in Miami. Bosh's career was cut short by a blood clotting condition that the NBA ruled to be a career-ending illness.[3][4] He played his final NBA game on February 9, 2016.[5] Notwithstanding the NBA's ruling, Bosh fought to resume his playing career for three years[6] before announcing in February 2019 that he intended to retire.[7] The same year, the Heat retired his No. 1 jersey.[8][9] In 2021, Bosh was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\nSeeking to promote sports and education amongst youths in Dallas and Toronto, Bosh set up the Chris Bosh Foundation and regularly speaks to youths about the benefits of reading.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn to Noel and Freida Bosh in Dallas, Texas,[11] Bosh was raised in Hutchins, a suburb of the city.[12] A family-oriented person, Bosh would often play basketball in the house with his younger brother, Joel.[13] At the early age of four years old, he started learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym where his father played pick-up games.[14] Since Bosh was always tall for his age, he was accustomed to out-rebounding his peers whenever he played;[15] but he only started learning the game of basketball seriously around fourth grade, doing so at a playground near his grandmother's house.[13]\n\n\nAs a child, Bosh participated in karate and gymnastics.[16] He also played baseball up until high school, chiefly as a first baseman according to his preference.[13]\n\n\nGrowing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influence on his personality and considers NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, after whom he modeled his play.[15] Academically, Bosh always excelled in school[17] as he was a member of the National Honor Society and several student engineering organizations.[16]\n\n\nBosh began garnering significant attention from college recruiters after he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and to the *USA Today* National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.[18]\n\n\nThe 6-foot-11 teenager helped Lincoln High capture the Class 4A state title as he delivered 23 points and 17 rebounds to go along with 9 blocks. Bosh was subsequently named High School Player of the Year by Basketball America; Powerade Player of the Year in Texas; a first-team All-American by *Parade*, McDonald's, and EA Sports; a second-team all-American by *USA Today* and *SLAM* Magazine; a first-team all-state player; and \"Mr. Basketball\" in Texas by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches.[18] With his combination of grades and basketball skills, Bosh's name was on a number of college recruiting lists. The University of Florida and University of Memphis among them made serious overtures, but it was Paul Hewitt, coach of Georgia Tech, who made the best impression. Bosh felt that Hewitt had his best interests at heart and respected his aspiration to play professionally; moreover, he was sufficiently impressed by what he saw of Georgia Tech's transition offense.[17]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nBosh eventually chose to follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management.[13] There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so.[11] Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, but by the end of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA.[17] He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season[11] and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career.[15]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors (2003–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh shooting a free throw during a game in the 2005–06 season\n#### Rookie year (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nIn what is widely regarded as one of the strongest draft classes in NBA history, which included future All-Stars LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade,[17] Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in the 2003 NBA draft and was signed on July 8, 2003.[19] Prior to his signing, however, other NBA teams made offers for Bosh as they knew Toronto needed a veteran scorer, and Raptors star Vince Carter himself pressed for a trade. General Manager Glen Grunwald turned everyone down.[17]\n\n\nIn his rookie season, Bosh was forced to play out of position as the Raptors' starting center after Antonio Davis was traded to the Chicago Bulls.[20] Night after night, the teenager with the \"slim frame\" battled against opponents who had a significant size and strength advantage over him.[20] Bosh—who cited teammate Michael Curry as his mentor[15]—was often praised by his coaches for his heart, and willingness to play through pain and injuries resulting from his lack of body strength compared to some of the league's strong forwards and centers.[21] Bosh's contributions were not unnoticed by teammates either,[22] as he averaged 11.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and 33.5 minutes in 75 games, leading all rookies in rebounding and blocks, and setting a franchise record for most rebounds in a rookie season with 557.[11] Bosh was rewarded by being selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2003–04 season.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Heralded as the new hope (2004–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh and his teammates in a 2005–06 game against the Milwaukee Bucks. From left: Pape Sow, Bosh, Mike James and Morris Peterson.\nWith the departure of the disenchanted franchise face of the team, Vince Carter, in December 2004, Bosh was simultaneously anointed as the new leader around whom Toronto would build.[23] In the remaining games following Carter's departure, the power forward averaged 18.4 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 38.1 minutes per game, improving in every major statistical category.[11] He was awarded his first ever NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played between January 3 and 9, 2005.[11] As the season drew to a close, analysts predicted that Bosh would become an All-Star one day.[24][25] Bosh ended the 2004–05 season as the leading scorer and leading rebounder for the team on 21 and 46 occasions respectively.[11]\n\n\nPrior to the 2005–06 season, Bosh was named as one of Toronto's team captains. Bosh continued to work on his game as he consistently chalked up double-doubles, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage for the first half of the season.[26] On February 9, 2006, for the first time in his career, Bosh was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference.[11] He was only the third Raptor to make an All-Star game, after Carter and Antonio Davis. Bosh's selection was just three days after he was named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career.[26] In March 2006, following a season-ending injury to Bosh,[27] the Raptors hit a 1–10 skid.[28] This highlighted Bosh's importance as the centerpiece of the offense, as well as the leader of the team. The Raptors finished the season 27–55 and Bosh averaged 22.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.[29]\n\n\n\n#### Leader of the division champions (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh improved his numbers in ppg and rpg in the 2006–07 season and had to lead a vastly different team from the 2005–06 roster.\nDespite a major off-season revamp of the Raptors roster—including the departure of good friends Mike James and Charlie Villanueva—Bosh officially signed a three-year contract extension with a player option for a fourth year on July 14, 2006.[30][31] The deal was reportedly worth US$65 million over four years.[32] Upon signing the contract, Bosh said \"I think the future is very positive for the franchise... change was needed... we have a lot of guys who just want to win and are willing to work hard.\"[32] During the same press conference, Bosh also announced a donation of $1 million to a Toronto charity, known as Community Legacy Programs.[30]\n\n\nAfter a shaky start to the Raptors' 2006–07 campaign, the Raptors managed to surpass the .500 mark as the All-Star break approached.[33] Bosh's play and leadership were pivotal to this run and as an increasing recognition of his abilities, on January 25, 2007, he was named an All-Star starter for the East in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. Bosh received the second highest number of votes among all Eastern Conference forwards.[34] This was his first All-Star start and second overall All-Star appearance, having averaged over 22 points and 11 rebounds in the first half of the season.[34] On January 31, 2007, in a game against the Washington Wizards, Bosh scored a 65-foot (20 m) buzzer-beating shot to end the third quarter of the game.[35] He shot 15-of-15 after missing his first four shots.[36] Bosh's in-form streak enabled him to be selected Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January 2007.[37] He had averaged 25.4 points and 9.1 rebounds while leading the Raptors to a 10–5 record in that month. On February 7, 2007, Bosh's career-high 41 points prompted the home fans to chant \"MVP\"—an unprecedented event in the Air Canada Centre.[38] Two days later, Bosh collected 29 points and 11 rebounds against the Los Angeles Lakers, shooting 10-of-10 in the second half.[39]\n\n\nOn March 28, 2007, Bosh became the new franchise record holder for double-doubles in a home win against the Miami Heat.[40] He was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the third time in his career shortly after,[41] having led Toronto to clinch a playoff berth for the first time in five years. Toronto went on to win its first ever division title, and concluded the regular season with a 47–35 record, including a 30–11 home record, both franchise records.[42] As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in the first round of the 2007 NBA playoffs. The series drew much media attention as Carter, who had left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances, was back at the ACC as a Net.[43] Toronto's inexperience was evident as they struggled offensively throughout the game, to eventually lose 96–91.[43] The Raptors won game 2 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds.[44] The Nets won Games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5.[45] The Nets went on to clinch the series with a win in game 6.[46] Bosh averaged a double-double with 22.6 ppg and 10.7 rpg for the regular season, both career-highs, and posted 17.5 ppg and 9.0 rpg for the playoffs.[29] He was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Struggles (2007–2009)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2007\nBefore the 2007–08 season began, Andrea Bargnani, the number one pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was slated to start at center and Bosh at power forward to form a strong Toronto frontcourt and Jason Kapono, a three-point specialist, was acquired via free agency from the Miami Heat to add offensive firepower; however, as the season unfolded, neither plans materialized as hoped.[48] Bosh himself had a slow start to the season, but as mid-season approached, his form picked up and he was named Player of the Week for the second week of January.[49] On January 31, 2008, he was selected to be on the Eastern Conference team for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game.[50] Bosh missed 15 games throughout the season, but the Raptors still managed to conclude the regular season with a 41–41 record, thus clinching the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 NBA playoffs. However, they were defeated by the Orlando Magic in the first round, losing 4–1.[51]\n\n\nThe first-round series against the Magic was touted as the matchup between two of the league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard.[52] Howard dominated throughout the series, while Bosh had a series-best effort in game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds.[53] General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, \"Whether it's protecting [Bosh] inside the paint, getting a little bit more of a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better\", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul.[54] Bosh said after the loss, \"They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good.\"[51] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.[55]\n\n\nTo provide Bosh with an experienced frontcourt partner, the Raptors pulled a blockbuster trade prior to the 2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers.[56] Bosh—who had won an Olympic gold medal with the national team at Beijing 2008—started the season strong. He averaged 26 points, 10 rebounds and 3.7 assists in his first three games and was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the fifth time in his career.[57] A week later, he became Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds, surpassing Antonio Davis's record.[58] While Bosh and O'Neal formed a formidable partnership in the frontcourt, the Raptors struggled to surpass the .500 mark. The principal deficiency of previous campaigns—wing players—continued to upend Toronto's progress.[59] With the Raptors at 8–9, head coach Sam Mitchell was sacked and replaced by Jay Triano.[60] Despite the move, injuries and weaknesses in the roster meant that the Raptors entered the All-Star break 13 games under .500.[61] On January 29, 2009, Bosh was named an All-Star reserve,[62] but an injury ruled him out of the game. Two weeks later, in a bid to bring in a wing player and create greater salary flexibility, O'Neal and Jamario Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[61] The trade did not improve the team's win–loss record, however, and the Raptors were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining.[63] The bright spark in Bosh's campaign was his career-high 22.7 points per game, as well as his being one of two players in the league that season (the other being Dwight Howard) to average a 20/10 in points and rebounds.[64] On April 20, 2009, Colangelo announced that he would offer Bosh a contract extension during the summer,[65] which Bosh later refused to sign.[66]\n\n\n\n#### Overhauling the roster (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nTo prepare for the 2009–10 season, Bosh worked out under Ken Roberson, looking to add 20 pounds (9 kg) and bring his weight up to 250 lb (110 kg).[66] Following the failure of the 2008–09 campaign, Colangelo knew that he had to shake up the roster to persuade Bosh to stay, and the Raptors were one of the busiest teams in the pre-season market.[67] They opened their season with a win against the heavily favored Cleveland Cavaliers, in which Bosh scored 21 points and pulled down 16 rebounds.[68] Bosh went on a tear, averaging 25.4 points and 11.9 rebounds in the first 16 games, but the Raptors were only able to win seven of those games.[68][69] The Raptors crossed into 2010 with a 16–17 record, and on January 3, 2010, Bosh overtook Vince Carter as Toronto's all-time leader in total points scored.[70] After pulling together a string of wins, Toronto were .500 after 40 games. Bosh was the league leader in double-doubles at the time, being only one of two players in the league who averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game.[71] On January 20, 2010, he scored a career-high 44 points in a loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, while collecting his 220th career double-double.[72] That same month, Bosh was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team,[73] and was Eastern Conference Player of the Week.[74] After the All-Star break, the Raptors went on several losing streaks and an injury to Bosh exacerbated the situation. As the regular season came to a close, the Raptors went from being the fifth seed before the All-Star break to fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot with the Chicago Bulls. After recording his 44th double-double on March 22, 2010, Bosh became the Raptors' all-time leader in number of double-doubles in a season. On April 5, 2010, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, winning the honor for the seventh time in his career (tying Carter for the most in franchise history).[75] However, Bosh was unable to play in a pivotal match against the Bulls on April 11, 2010. The blowout loss cost Toronto their tie-breaker and ultimately the eighth seed, as the Bulls finished with 41 wins to Toronto's 40.[76]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2010–2017)[edit]\n\n\n#### Joining the Heat and debut season (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2010\nAfter the 2009–10 season was over, there was much speculation over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. Bosh signed with the Miami Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal, which sent two 2011 first-round draft picks to the Raptors (Norris Cole and Jonas Valančiūnas were later selected).[77][78] Bosh was a part of the first player-created NBA superteam.[79] Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, \"[K]now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me. I've loved every minute here and I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart...\"[80] Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, he was one of only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.[81]\n\n\nDespite being widely tipped as contenders, the Heat got off to a tentative 9–8 start. The Heat managed to go on to compile a 21–1 record, however, and were jostling with the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls for pole position in the Eastern Conference as mid-season approached.[82] Miami finished the regular season with 58 wins and faced Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs. Miami won the series in five games, and also prevailed in five games in the semi-finals against Boston. In the Conference Finals against Chicago, Bosh was particularly instrumental, averaging 23.2 points in the 4–1 series win. He was slow off the blocks in the Finals against Dallas, shooting below .300 in the first two games, but scored the winning shot in game 3 to give Miami a 2–1 lead. That was the last game Miami won, as Dallas won the next three to win its first-ever championship. Bosh was seen sobbing as he walked to the locker room following the loss.\n\n\n\n#### Consecutive NBA championships (2011–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in a layup line before a game against the Dallas Mavericks in 2012\nOn January 5, 2012, Bosh led the Heat to a 116–109 triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks, highlighted by a three-point shot he made to force the game into overtime with 0.6 seconds left to play in the fourth quarter. Bosh finished the game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocked shots.[83] By season's end, the Heat had embraced a small-ball strategy that featured Bosh at the center position. In the playoffs, Bosh averaged 14.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a game. In game 1 of the Conference Semi-finals against the Indiana Pacers, he suffered a lower abdominal strain that forced him to miss the rest of the series and the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston. Bosh returned in the Conference Finals against the Celtics. He was moved to center for the remainder of the playoffs, while James, who had filled in at power forward during his absence, remained at that position.[84][85] Boston pushed Miami to seven games, and in the final game, Bosh scored 19 points, including 3-of-4 shooting from three-point range, to help the Heat advance to their second straight NBA Finals, this time against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder won the first game of the series before Miami rolled to a 4–1 victory, giving Bosh his first NBA championship. Bosh scored 24 points in the deciding game 5 and averaged 14.6 points and 9.4 rebounds in the Finals.\n\n\nBosh remained the Heat's starting center during the 2012–13 season. On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra.[86] The Heat achieved the league's best record and swept through the first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in five games, with Bosh scoring 20 points to go with 19 rebounds in a crucial game 3 win in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs, as the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven-game series against Indiana. The Heat and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs blew out Miami in game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead. In game 4, Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to complement Wade's 32 points and James's 33 points to bolster the Heat's win, tying the series. San Antonio would bounce back in game 5 to force the Heat to win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide-open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA championship.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Coming up short (2013–2014)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Bosh played and started in 79 games, averaging 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He also hit a career-high 74 three-point shots on 33 percent shooting from beyond the arc. In the playoffs, Bosh helped the Heat return to the NBA Finals, where they faced the San Antonio Spurs once again. This time, however, the Heat were outclassed by the Spurs, as they lost the series in five games.\n\n\n\n#### Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 30, 2014, after wide speculation that he would join the Houston Rockets, Bosh re-signed with the Heat to a five-year, $118 million contract after LeBron James announced he was leaving Miami to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[88][89] After averaging 21.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals over the first 23 games of the 2014–15 season, Bosh was ruled out indefinitely on December 15 with a strained calf.[90] He went on to miss eight games before returning on December 29 against the Orlando Magic.[91] After playing in the 2015 All-Star Game, Bosh was admitted to a Miami hospital for lung tests during the All-Star break.[92][93] On February 21, 2015, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a blood clot in one of his lungs.[94]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2015, Bosh made his return to the court in the Heat's season opener against the Charlotte Hornets, recording 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 104–94 win.[95] On November 10, 2015, he scored a then season-high 30 points in a 101–88 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[96] On December 28, 2015, he recorded 24 points and 12 rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets, and hit a career-best 5-of-5 from three-point range.[97] On January 4, 2016, he recorded a season-high 31 points and 11 rebounds in a 103–100 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers.[98] Though he was voted to play in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, and selected to compete in the Three-Point Contest, due to a calf injury, Bosh was forced to withdraw from both.[99]\n\n\nA blood clot in his leg again forced Bosh to miss time following the 2016 All-Star break. He faced increasing pressure from physicians and the Heat organization to sit out the rest of the season because of the potential dangers of the recurring medical condition.[100] Following the Heat's February 9 game against San Antonio, Bosh did not play any regular-season or playoff games for Miami in 2016.[3][101][102] On May 4, 2016, the Heat announced that Bosh would be held out for the remainder of the playoffs.[3]\n\n\n\n#### Comeback attempts and retirement (2016–2019)[edit]\n\n\nBosh was initially optimistic about a return to the Heat for the 2016–17 season, and the organization had become increasingly hopeful that he would be cleared for camp. Those hopes quickly faded due to Bosh's continued issues with blood clotting.[103] In September 2016, Bosh failed his physical exam and was not cleared by the team to participate in training camp.[104] On September 26, 2016, Heat president Pat Riley said that the team viewed Bosh's career with the team as over.[105] In May 2017, Bosh and the Heat reportedly reached a unique agreement in which Bosh would leave the Heat without his salary taking up the team's salary cap space for the 2017–18 season.[106]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2017, the NBA ruled that Bosh's blood clotting issues were a career-ending illness, meaning the Heat would be allowed to remove his contract from their salary cap once they officially released him.[4] Two days later, the Heat announced that they had waived Bosh, ending a seven-year stint with the organization.[107] Following Bosh's release, Heat President Pat Riley said, \"The number '1' will never be worn by another player and we can't wait to someday hang his jersey in the rafters\".[108] In February 2018, Bosh declared himself on the comeback trail, having refused to rule out a return to the NBA.[6][109]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2019, Bosh announced that he was no longer pursuing his NBA career[110] and that he planned to retire from the NBA when his jersey was retired by the Heat.[111] The Heat retired Bosh's No. 1 jersey on March 26 before a regular season game against the Orlando Magic.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|

when he was selected as a member of the 2002 USA Basketball Junior World Championship Qualifying Team that finished with a 4–1 record and the bronze medal.[112]\n\n\nAfter his NBA career began, Bosh was named in March 2006 to the 2006–2008 United States men's national basketball team program, and helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour.[112] In August 2006, Bosh was named as a member of the 2006 USA World Championship Team.[112] Together with fellow 2003 draftees Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kirk Hinrich, this team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal, defeating former 2004 Olympic champion Argentina.[113] Bosh was ranked sixth in field goal percentage.[112]\n\n\nFollowing the 2006–07 season, Bosh was named to the team that would compete in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. However, he sustained a foot injury and withdrew from the squad.[114] On June 23, 2008, he was named to the team that would compete in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.[115] During the tournament itself, Bosh operated as the main backup to center Dwight Howard as Team USA went unbeaten in all eight games en route to the gold medal, defeating Spain in the final.[116] He averaged 9.1 points per game, and led the team in rebounds with 6.1 a game.[117]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Bosh withdrew his name from consideration for the 2012 Olympics in London to recover from a lower abdominal strain that kept him out of some playoff games.[118]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> You are not going to see a whole lot of screaming and hollering at guys... He is a guy that is going to pull somebody aside and say it in a positive way, and I think it goes a lot farther that way.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAnthony Parker on Bosh's leadership[119]\n\n![](image)The mid-range jump shot was one of Bosh's trademark moves.\nBosh traditionally played the power forward position, including during his first season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) and 235 pounds (107 kg),[29] Bosh possessed excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size.[120] He was particularly noted for his ability to drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he was also proficient, but he was also known for his well-developed jump shot.[121] Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: \"We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work either. I don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth.\"[122] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions.[123] He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left.[124] It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his \"arrival\" to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime.[11] When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot .343 from the three-point arc for the season; he improved to .400 the following season.[29] Because of his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.\n\n\nBosh was noted for his leadership. When he was the leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to maintain his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic.[121] However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who made bad calls on the court.[125] Throughout his career, comparisons were made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.\n\n\n\n## Honors and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* **NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Month**: January 2007\n* **9× NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week**: January 3, 2005; January 30, 2006; March 26, 2007; January 7, 2008; October 28, 2008; February 1, 2010; April 5, 2010; December 23, 2013; October 28, 2014\n* **NBA Atlantic Division champion**: 2007\n* **4× NBA Southeast Division champion**: 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n* **2× NBA champion**: 2012, 2013\n* **11× NBA All-Star**: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016\n* **All-NBA Second Team**: 2007\n* **NBA All-Rookie Team**: 2004\n* **2× NBA Rookie All-Star Game**: 2004, 2005\n* **3× NBA Shooting Stars champion** (with Swin Cash and Dominique Wilkins) 2013, 2014, 2015[126]\n* Bronze medal winner with Team USA at the 2006 FIBA World Championship\n* Gold medal winner with Team USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics\n* Third-youngest player in NBA history to record 1,000 rebounds[11]\n* Fourth-youngest player in NBA history to record 20 points and 20 rebounds in a game[11]\n* Toronto's first player to achieve 10,000 points\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in defensive rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds per game\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds per game in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in blocks\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws made[127]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws made in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws attempted[127]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws attempted in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in double-doubles[40]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in double-doubles in a season\n* NBA Sportsmanship Award (divisional winner): 2007–08[128]\n* Elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh at the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards\nBesides his on-the-court exploits, Bosh was a National Honor Society member and graduated with honors from Lincoln.[14] He is also a member of the National Society of Black Engineers and the Dallas Association of Minority Engineers.[14] Following his success in the NBA, Bosh soon had his own YouTube channel,[129] and has since made various TV appearances. In December 2009, First Ink, a DVD featuring comedic digital shorts and a documentary about Bosh, was released. The DVD was filmed during the summer of 2009.[130] A fan of the *X-Men* television series as a child, Bosh voiced the Marvel Comics character Heimdall in an episode of *Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.* in 2014.[131][132] He also made appearances on episodes of *Entourage* and *Parks and Recreation*.[133]\n\n\nIn the field of philanthropy, Bosh established the Chris Bosh Foundation in 2004. Remembering the challenges he faced as a youth,[14] Bosh founded the organization to help younger people in academics and athletics.[134] The Foundation, with programs in Toronto and Dallas, has worked closely with organizations such as the Toronto Special Olympics to raise important funding for community projects.[14] Bosh's mother, Freida, has served as CEO of the Foundation.[134] As an avid reader, Bosh also regularly speaks to groups of children about the benefits of reading,[12] and has received the NBA Community Assist Award for his active contributions for the Raptors community development program in Toronto and Dallas during the course of the NBA campaign.[135] In November 2008, Bosh pledged to donate $75,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada.[136] He is also an advocate for increased computer literacy in schools, supporting the non-profit code.org.[137]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2011, Bosh married Adrienne Williams.[138][139] They renewed their vows on July 16, 2011.[140] The couple have five children, three sons and two daughters.[141][142]\n\n\nBosh has dabbled in hip-hop production. In 2017, alongside record producer, songwriter, and singer Rico Love, Bosh co-produced a song titled \"Miss My Woe\" by Gucci Mane.[143] The song is featured on Gucci's 11th studio album titled, *Mr. Davis*.\n\n\nIn June 2021, Bosh published his book, *Letters to a Young Athlete.*[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n### Paternity lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nOn March 24, 2009, it was reported that Bosh's former girlfriend, Allison Mathis, was seeking child support and sole custody of their daughter, Trinity (born November 2, 2008). Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home.[147] Three days later, it was reported that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid.[148] Mathis' lawyer also told the press, \"My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything on our side... She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to have a good relationship with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult.\"[148]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* Toronto Raptors accomplishments and records\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chiari, Mike. \"Chris Bosh on NBA Career: 'I've Made the Decision Not to Pursue It Anymore'\". *Bleacher Report*.

Wade is also Miami's all-time leader in points, games, assists, steals, shots made, and shots taken.[5] Wade is widely regarded as one of the greatest shooting guards in NBA history.[6][7][8] Wade is currently the host of the American adaptation of *The Cube*.\n\n\nAfter a successful college basketball career with the Marquette Golden Eagles, including leading the team to the Final Four in 2003, Wade was drafted fifth overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Heat. In his third season, Wade led the Heat to their first NBA Championship and was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Wade led the United States men's basketball team, commonly known as the \"Redeem Team\", in scoring and helped them capture the gold medal. In the 2008–09 season, Wade led the league in both total points (2,386) and points per game (30.2), the latter stat earning him his sole NBA scoring title. Wade was selected as the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 2010. With LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Wade helped guide Miami to four consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 to 2014, and won back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. Wade briefly left Miami to play for the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers throughout 2016–2018 before returning to Miami to finish his playing career and retire with the Heat in 2019. The Heat retired his #3 jersey in 2020. He purchased a minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz in 2021. In October 2021, Wade was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[9] In 2023, it was announced that Wade would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nWade was born the second of two children to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr. in Chicago, Illinois, on January 17, 1982. Wade attributes the uncommon spelling of his and his father's first name to his grandmother.[11] JoLinda already had two children when she married Wade's father, and with him she had Dwyane and his older sister Tragil. The pair separated when Wade was four months old. Wade described his early childhood in the South Side of Chicago as trying.[12]\n\n\nWhen his parents divorced, JoLinda was given custody of the two children. JoLinda struggled with drug addiction and often committed crimes that sent her to prison. At eight years old, Tragil tricked her brother Dwyane into thinking they were going to the movies, only to take him to live with his father and stepmother. Wade visited his mother on occasion until his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois, after which Wade would not see her for two years.[13]\n\n\nWade turned to basketball and football, avoiding the temptations of drugs and gangs. Wade credited Tragil as the person most responsible for pointing him in the right direction.[14] Wade grew up idolizing Michael Jordan and modeled his game after him.[15] On October 14, 2001, as Wade's basketball career blossomed, JoLinda vowed to turn her life around. She says that she has not used drugs since 2003.[16]\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\nWade played basketball and football for Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. He immediately excelled as a wide receiver and also played as a backup quarterback, but success in basketball took longer.[14] He grew four inches by the start of his junior year and emerged as the team leader, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds.[17]\n\n\nWade's improvement continued into his senior year, when he averaged 27 points and 11 rebounds.[18] He led the Bulldogs to a 24–5 record and to a Class AA Eisenhower Sectional appearance. Wade set school records for points scored (676) and steals made (106).[19] He credited coach Jack Fitzgerald as a seminal and positive influence. Wade was recruited to play basketball only by Marquette, Illinois State, and DePaul, due to disqualifyingly low ACT scores.[13]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nWade committed to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to play under coach Tom Crean. In his freshman year, Wade was sidelined by NCAA Proposition 48, which set academic eligibility requirements for participation in Division I sports. Effort and tutoring[20] sufficiently raised his academic standing so that he became eligible by the start of his sophomore year.[21]\n\n\n\n### 2001–02 season[edit]\n\n\nWade led the Marquette Golden Eagles in scoring with 17.8 points (ppg) and led Conference USA in both steals per game with 2.47 and 2-point field goals made with 205;[22] he averaged 6.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists.[23] Marquette finished with a 26–7 record, their best since the 1993–94 season.[19]\n\n\n\n### 2002–03 season[edit]\n\n\nWade again led the school in scoring with 21.5 points and the Golden Eagles finished with a 27–6 record.[24] Three days after JoLinda was released from prison, she saw Wade play basketball for the first time in five years as Marquette upset the Cincinnati Bearcats, 70–61, to capture the Conference USA title on March 8, 2003. He helped bring the Golden Eagles to the Final Four for the first time since their 1977 national championship season. Wade was subsequently named to the All-America First Team by the Associated Press (AP), making him the first basketball player from Marquette to receive the distinction since 1978.[19]\n\n\nWade's performance during the Midwest Regional final drew national attention. Against a top-seeded Kentucky team, he delivered 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists, including a memorable breakaway dunk, as Marquette upset the Wildcats, 83–69, and advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1977. Wade's triple double was the fourth ever recorded in NCAA tournament history. The Golden Eagles finished their season as No.6 in the AP Poll, Marquette's highest ranking since 1976–77. Wade was named the MVP of the Midwest Regional. His performance earned him a high NBA draft projection.[25] As a result, Wade skipped his senior year to enter the 2003 NBA draft.\n\n\nMarquette retired his jersey on February 3, 2007. It ordinarily requires student-athletes to have graduated for jersey retirement, but made an exception for Wade.[26]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2003–2016)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie year (2003–04)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade dunking the ball during the 2004 Rookie Challenge game for the Rookies team\nSelected fifth in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, Wade became the highest ranked of only four Marquette first round draft picks.[27] Wade quickly emerged as a productive player, averaging 16.2 points on 46.5% shooting as well as 4 rebounds and 4.5 assists.[28] After a 5–15 start, the Heat gradually improved to finish 42–40 and qualify for the playoffs.[29] Wade served up outstanding postseason performances, particularly against the Indiana Pacers during the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[27] Wade earned a unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team[27] and finished third in Rookie of the Year voting (after LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony).[27] He placed among the top five rookies in several statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played.[27]\n\n\nIn the first playoff game, Wade hit a running jumper with 1.3 seconds left in the final quarter to give the Heat an 81–79 victory over the New Orleans Hornets. Winning that series 4–3, the Heat faced the Indiana Pacers, who were the top-seeded team with the best record in the NBA. The Heat lost the series 4–2. Wade became only the fourth rookie in the shot clock era to lead his team in points and assists during the postseason.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Breakthrough year (2004–05)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with the ball versus the Milwaukee Bucks in 2005\nThe Heat traded with the Los Angeles Lakers for center Shaquille O'Neal. Improving on their previous season's 42–40 record by 17 games, Miami went 59–23, leading the Eastern Conference.[30] Wade earned a reserve slot in the season's All-Star Game; adding 14 points in 24 minutes of play.[28]\n\n\nIn the first round of the 2005 playoffs, Wade averaged 26.3 points, 8.8 assists, and 6 rebounds a night while maintaining a 50% field-goal percentage as the Heat swept the New Jersey Nets.[31] In the second round he averaged 31 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists per game as the Heat swept the Washington Wizards.[31] The Heat lost the Eastern Conference Finals 4–3 to the Detroit Pistons, the previous season's champions. Wade scored 42 points in Game 2 and 36 in Game 3 despite playing with sinusitis, the flu, and a knee strain. He suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 that prevented him from playing in the sixth game and limited him in the seventh.[32][30]\n\n\n\n#### NBA champion and Finals MVP (2005–06)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade at the free throw line\nIn the 2005–06 season, Wade was elected to the All-Star Game as a starter. During 30 minutes of play, he put up 20 points on 9-of-11 field goals.[33] Wade finished the regular season averaging 27.2 points, 6.7 assists, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.95 steals.[34]\n\n\nIn the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Miami played the Chicago Bulls. Wade incurred several injuries, including a severely bruised hip during Game 5.[35] He scored 15 of his 28 points while suffering intense pain, to give the Heat a 3–2 series lead. Wade led Miami past the Detroit Pistons despite experiencing flu-like symptoms in Game 6.[36] In the series-clinching contest, he landed 14 points and 10 assists.[36]\n\n\nDuring the 2006 NBA Finals, Miami faced the Dallas Mavericks. Wade's 42, 36, and 43 points in Games 3, 4, and 5, respectively, helped the Heat go from a 0–2 deficit to a 3–2 series lead.[37] In Game 3, Wade's 42 points tied his playoff-high and his 13 rebounds were a career-high.[38][39] The Heat took Game 6 behind Wade's 36 points, taking the series 4–2, earning Wade the Finals MVP trophy.[40] He became the fifth-youngest player in NBA history to capture the Finals MVP award, and his 34.7 points were the Finals' third-highest among players in their first NBA Finals.[41] His 33.8 player efficiency rating (PER) over the NBA Finals was ranked by John Hollinger of ESPN as the best since the NBA-ABA merger.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Injuries and missing playoffs (2006–2008)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, Wade missed 31 games due to injury; even so, he was elected to his third consecutive All-Star Game and received All-NBA honors. He became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing 31 or more games since Pete Maravich.[27] The Heat struggled with injuries in general and were 20–25 on February 1, 2007.[43] Playing the Houston Rockets on February 21, 2007, Wade dislocated his left shoulder and left the court in a wheelchair.[44] Wade chose to delay surgery and instead rehabilitate his shoulder in time for the postseason.[45] After missing 23 games, Wade returned to the active roster. Sporting a black shoulder sleeve, Wade played 27 minutes and notched 12 points and 8 assists in the 111–103 overtime loss.[46] For the season, Wade averaged 27.4 points, 7.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.1 steals, while shooting 50% from the field; further, he finished the season as the NBA PER leader.[47]\n\n\nDuring the 2007 playoffs, Wade averaged 23.5 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.8 rebounds per contest, but were swept in the first round by the Chicago Bulls.[48] Post-playoffs, Wade underwent a pair of surgeries to repair his dislocated left shoulder and left knee, both of which proved successful. However, the knee ailment, commonly called \"jumper's knee\", prevented Wade from joining USA Basketball in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament over that summer.[49]\n\n\nAfter missing the Tournament of Americas' Olympic Qualifiers as well as the preseason and the first seven games, Wade began the 2007–08 season on November 14, 2007.[50] Despite battling pain in his injured knee throughout the season,[51] Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance.[52] However, the Heat held the worst record in the NBA. Wade's knee problems led Riley sit Wade for the final 21 games to undergo long overdue OssaTron treatment.[53] Wade averaged 24.6 points, 6.9 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.7 steals.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Scoring champion and playoff defeats (2008–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade dribbling the ball in 2009\nAfter months of rehab, he helped the U.S. National Team win gold at the 2008 Olympics, leading the team in scoring. Wade returned to the starting lineup to begin the 2008–09 campaign.[54][55] Early that season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to post at least 40 points, 10 assists and 5 blocks in one game since Alvan Adams in 1976–77.[56] Wade was elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star Game.[57]\n\n\nAfter the All-Star break, Wade recorded 50 points on 56.6% shooting along with 5 rebounds and 5 assists during a blow-out loss to the Orlando Magic;[58] making him the fourth in NBA history to score at least 50 points in a game that his team lost by at least 20.[58] In the very next contest, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and 7 rebounds.[59] Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring 50-plus points since Wilt Chamberlain.[60] Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record, scoring 24 points in the final quarter to secure a 120–115 win over the New York Knicks.[61] For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, plus 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocked shots.[61] In the next game he banked 40-points versus the Cleveland Cavaliers.[62] Wade put up 41 points on 53% shooting along with 9 assists, 7 steals, 7 rebounds and a block in the 107–100 loss.[62] The following game, Wade tied his career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, plus a steal and a block, as the Heat beat the Phoenix Suns 135–129.[63] Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with 30-plus points and 15 or more assists.[63] Less than a week later, Wade hit the buzzer-beater and tied his earlier franchise record with his 78th straight double-digit scoring game in double-overtime against the Chicago Bulls.[64] Wade finished the game with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes of play.[64] Wade joined Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to record that many points and that many assists in a single game while having as high of a field goal percentage.[65] Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning to become the Heat's all-time leading scorer in triple overtime versus the Utah Jazz.[66] Wade finished that 140–129 victory with 50 points to go along with his 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals and 2 blocks.[66]\n\n\nWade became the only player to reach 2,000 points, 500 assists, 150 steals, and 100 blocks as well as the only player under 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) to block upwards of 100 shots in a single season.[67][68] He became the fifth player to accumulate 2,000 points, 500 assists, and 150 steals in a season.[69] Wade helped the Heat clinch a playoff berth and become only the second team to make the postseason after winning 15 or fewer games the season before.[70] In a 122–105 victory over the New York Knicks, Wade recorded a career-high 55 points on 63% field goal shooting and added 9 rebounds and 4 assists.[71] Wade recorded 50 points in only three quarters and was pulled out of the game, one point shy of eclipsing Glen Rice's 56-point franchise record.[71] Wade averaged a league-leading 30.2 points for his first NBA scoring title. He added 7.5 assists, 5 rebounds, 2.2 steals, and 1.3 blocks.[47] Wade wrapped up the season with higher point, assist, steal, and block averages than James and Kobe Bryant, both of whom finished ahead of Wade in the MVP race.\n\n\nOn November 1, in what was only his third game of the 2009–10 season, Wade recorded his 10,000th career point during a 95–87 win against the Chicago Bulls.[72] On November 12, Wade made a spectacular dunk over Cavalier Anderson Varejão. James regarded the dunk as \"great, probably top 10 all-time\".[73] Two days later against the New Jersey Nets, Wade hit another buzzer beater for a one-point win at 81–80.[74] On January 6, Wade scored a season-high 44 points during an overtime loss to the Boston Celtics, the most in a losing effort that season.[75] Wade appeared in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game.[76] Wade was named the game's MVP with 28 points, 11 assists, 5 steals and 6 rebounds.[77]\n\n\nOn February 17, Wade strained his calf. He left the game, ending his personal and the Heat's franchise-record streak of 148 consecutive games with at least 10 points.[78] Wade was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for the fifth time and Player of the Week twice for his play in the month of March. He averaged 26.9 and 7.5 assists, both of which ranked third in the Eastern Conference, and 2.3 steals per game, which ranked first. Wade recorded six 30-point games and had six double-doubles in the month, including a season-high 14 assists.[79]\n\n\nFor the season, Wade averaged 26.6 points on 47.6% field goal shooting to go with 6.5 assists, 4.8 rebounds, 1.8 steals and 1.1 blocks; doing so, he led his team to a 47–35 record and the fifth playoff seed.[47] In the first round, down 0–3 against the Boston Celtics, Wade recorded a career playoff and franchise record with 46 points; he outscored the entire Celtics team in the fourth quarter.[80] It was Wade's sixth career playoff game with at least 40 points.[47] Despite his averaging 33.2 points on 56.4% shooting, 6.8 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1.6 blocks per contest, the Heat fell to Boston in five games.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Big Three era and back-to-back championships (2010–2014)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with his teammate LeBron James\nDuring the off-season, the Miami-Dade County commission renamed the area \"Miami-Wade County\" from July 1 to 7, a week that coincided with the start of free agency, intended to help convince Wade to stay with the Heat.[82] On July 7, it was announced that Wade would sign with Miami, along with Toronto Raptor star Chris Bosh.[83] The following day, LeBron James announced he would join the Heat.[84]\n\n\nIn the first year of the Big 3 Era, the Heat finished with a 58–24 record and earned the second seed in the Eastern Conference. Wade averaged 25.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 1.5 steals while shooting 50%. After defeating the Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics, and Chicago Bulls, the Heat reached the NBA Finals but ultimately fell to the Dallas Mavericks in six games. Wade averaged 26.5 points, 7 rebounds, and 5.2 assists for the Finals and 24.5 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.4 assists for the playoffs.[85]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2012, Wade recorded the third triple-double in the history of the All-Star Game, posting 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, joining Jordan and James. On March 10, 2012, Wade made the game-winning shot against the Indiana Pacers, giving the Heat a 93–91 overtime win. Wade finished the season averaging 22.1 points, 4.8 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals. The Heat defeated the New York Knicks in 5 games and the Indiana Pacers in six games. In Game 6 of the second round, Wade recorded 41 points and 10 rebounds.[86] The Heat prevailed in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals, beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games. Wade averaged 22.6 points. The Heat became the first team in NBA history to win a championship after trailing in three playoff series.\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2012–13 season, Wade underwent left knee surgery, missing the 2012 Summer Olympics.[87][88] On December 26, 2012, playing the Charlotte Bobcats, Wade kicked guard Ramon Sessions in the groin. The following day, Wade was suspended by the NBA for one game.[89] Wade finished the 2012–2013 season with averages of 21.2 points, 5 rebounds and 5.1 assists.\n\n\nIn the playoffs, injuries limited Wade to a career-low scoring average of 15.9 points per game, but he upped his average to 19.6 points during the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. After the teams split the first two games in Miami, the Spurs took Game 3. In Game 4, Wade scored 32 points on 56 percent shooting to go with 6 steals as the Heat won 109–93. The Spurs took Game 5 despite Wade's 25 points and 10 assists. Wade scored 14 points in Miami's overtime win in Game 6, followed by 23 points and 10 rebounds in Game 7 as the Heat clinched their second straight championship and Wade's third title.[90][91]\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Wade missed 28 games from injuries and the team's decision to rest him during \"back-to-back\" games. Wade averaged 19 points and posted a career-high 54% field goal percentage. In the playoffs, the team increased Wade's minutes, highlighted by a 28-point performance in Miami's second-round victory over the Brooklyn Nets and a 23-point outing in a road victory against Indiana in the Eastern Finals. The Heat won the series in six games, advancing to their fourth straight NBA Finals. Wade averaged 19.1 points on 52 percent shooting, his best playoff percentage since 2010. The Heat lost to the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 NBA Finals in five games.\n\n\n\n#### Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade making a lay-up for the Heat in 2015\nOn June 28, 2014, Wade and teammates James and Bosh all opted out of their contracts in order to cut costs, but intended to re-sign.[92] James then announced that he was returning to Cleveland. Wade re-signed with the Heat,[93] joined by Bosh, Udonis Haslem, Chris Andersen and Mario Chalmers as well as former rivals Danny Granger and Luol Deng.\n\n\nIn the 2014–15 season, Wade missed seven consecutive games due to a hamstring injury.[94] On December 17, 2014, he scored a season-high 42 points, his highest total in almost four years, but Miami lost 105–87 to Utah.[95] He was again named an All-Star but pulled out due to another hamstring injury.[96] The Heat finished the season with a 37–45 record, as Wade missed the postseason for just the second time.\n\n\nOn June 29, 2015, Wade opted out of his contract,[97] but then signed a one-year, $20 million contract.[98] Wade hit just seven 3-point shots during the 2015–16 regular season. However, in the 2016 postseason, Wade converted on his first seven three-point shot attempts. Wade had never made more than five three-pointers in a row.[99]\n\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls (2016–2017)[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Wade joined his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls, on a two-year deal worth approximately $47 million.[100][101] Initially, the Heat offered a two-year, $20 million contract,[102] before increasing it to a two-year, $40 million offer, both of which Wade felt were unacceptable.[103][104] The relationship ended badly with Wade and the Heat squabbling.\n\n\nWade teamed with Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo in Chicago.[105] In January 2017, the trio were all fined for criticizing their young teammates' effort. In March 2017, Wade sustained a fractured elbow,[105] returning for the playoffs,[105] but the Bulls were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics in the first round.[106]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2017–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with the Cavs in 2017\nOn September 24, 2017, three months after trading Butler and waiving Rondo, the Bulls reached an agreement on a buyout with Wade.[105] Three days later, Wade signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, reuniting him with Miami Heat teammate LeBron James.[107] During the season, Wade objected to coach Tyronn Lue's plan to play him off the bench. Wade started for the Cavaliers in the first three games, but shot only 7-for-25. After a blowout loss to the Orlando Magic in the third game, Wade volunteered to take a bench role, becoming leader of the second unit.[108]\n\n\n\n### Return to Miami (2018–2019)[edit]\n\n\nOn February 8, 2018, at the NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster.[109] Acquiring guards Jordan Clarkson, George Hill and Rodney Hood, the Cavaliers[109] traded Wade back to the Miami Heat in exchange for a protected 2024 second-round draft pick.[110] At the funeral of Wade's long-time agent Henry Thomas in January, Wade mended relations with Riley. On February 9, in his first game, Wade was garnered a standing ovation and came off the bench in a 91–85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[111] On February 27, Wade scored a season-high 27 points as the Heat rallied to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 102–101. On April 3, in a 101–98 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Wade reached 5,000 assists in a Heat uniform, becoming the ninth player to score 20,000 points and collect 5,000 assists with one team, joining Karl Malone, Bryant, Jordan, James, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West.[112] On April 16, Wade scored 28 points to end the 76ers' 17-game winning streak and lead the Heat to a 113–103 Game 2 win over Philadelphia and even the first-round playoff series. He passed Larry Bird for 10th on the NBA's career postseason scoring list.[113]\n\n\nIn the off-season, Wade announced his intentions to retire after the 2018–19 season,[114][115][116] re-signing with the Heat on September 18.[117] He missed seven games in mid-November due to the birth of his daughter.[118] On November 25, Wade scored a season-high 35 points, the most ever by a Miami bench player.[119] On December 9, he scored 25 points in his 1,000th career game.[120] On January 6, 2019, Wade became the third player in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 5,000 assists, 4,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals, 800 blocks and 500 three-pointers.[121] Wade was named by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver as a special roster addition for the 2019 All-Star game, thus marking his 13th All-Star appearance.[122] Wade had received the second-most fan votes for guards in the Eastern Conference.[123] On April 9, Wade played his last home game in Miami, scoring 30 points.[124] In his final game the following night, Wade recorded his fifth career triple-double with 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.[125][126]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2020, the Heat announced that Wade's No. 3 jersey would be retired on February 22.[127]\n\n\n\n## NBA executive career[edit]\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Miami, Wade had discussed the potential for a future ownership stake in the Heat franchise but Wade was unable to commit at the time, according to Heat owner Micky Arison.[128]\n\n\nOn April 16, 2021, it was announced that Wade had purchased an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz franchise of the NBA, joining an ownership group led by his personal friend and associate, Ryan Smith, the Jazz majority owner and team governor. Wade is a member of a small ownership group that includes Smith, his wife Ashley, investor and Accel partner Ryan Sweeney, Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and the Miller family, which previously owned the team.[4]\n\n\n\n\n> \"This goes way beyond the dream I had to just play basketball in the NBA. I've seen Shaq do it in Sacramento. I've seen Grant Hill do it in Atlanta. I've seen Jordan do it in Charlotte. If this partnership is going to be anything like my relationship is with Ryan, there are going to be a lot of things that I'll want to be involved in. [...] Unfortunately, people in my community don't get this opportunity, and I do not take it lightly to have this opportunity. To make real change, this is where you have to be -- at the top -- and Ryan knows that. I'm thankful for him, and I know too that I bring a lot to this partnership outside of just my basketball knowledge and skills.\n> \n> — Dwyane Wade on purchasing an ownership stake in the Jazz[4]\n> \n\n\nWade said in the announcement of his purchase that he hoped to take a hands-on approach to his involvement, and highlighted his close brother-like relationship with Jazz star Donovan Mitchell, who he called the player most like him and \"2.0\".[4]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade shooting a free-throw against China during the 2008 Olympics\nWade was a member of the 2004 Olympic team, which won a bronze medal in Athens. The team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, in which Wade averaged 19.3 points per game.[129] The U.S. national team won a bronze medal.[130] Wade was named to the national team roster from 2006 to 2008; and, together with James and Anthony, Wade co-captained the 2006 team.[131]\n\n\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics, the United States went undefeated and captured gold medal honors after beating Spain, the 2006 World champions. Wade, who led the team in scoring, tallied a game-high 27 points in 27 minutes on 75% field goal shooting and added 4 steals, 2 assists, and 2 rebounds.[132] Wade averaged a team-high 16 points in 18 minutes on 67% field goal shooting, 4 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2.3 steals, as the U.S. lived up to their Redeem Team moniker and claimed gold medal honors for the first time since 2000.[132][133]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade's pre-game ritual consisted of doing pull-ups at the rim.\nListed at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall and weighing 220 pounds (100 kg), Wade was a shooting guard who could play point as he did during his rookie season and with smaller lineups. On offense, he was one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in NBA history. Wade's signature one-two step allowed him to dash past bigger defenders and draw fouls.[134] Wade ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. Wade was an unselfish player, averaging 5.4 assists for his career.[34] After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the league's premier clutch players.[135]\n\n\nDavid Thorpe, an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players, cited Wade's post-up game as one of his strengths.[136] Thorpe said that Wade's best moves from the post were his turnaround jump shot,[136] double pivot,[136] and what Thorpe termed a \"freeze fake\",[137] a pump fake Wade used to get his opponent to jump, so that he could drive around him.[137] Wade's main weakness was three-point shooting; he averaged 29% for his career.[34]\n\n\nWade was best known for his ability to convert difficult lay-ups, even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders.[134] His style drew concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner,[134] as Wade had hurt his knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players. Wade established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals.[138] He holds the NBA record for blocks by players listed 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and under, which he achieved in only 679 games; this is over 400 games less than the previous record-holder Dennis Johnson (1,100).[139]\n\n\nIn 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Wade as the 28th greatest player in NBA history.[140]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |

girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches in 2002. They split in 2007, and he divorced her in 2010 after an acrimonious court battle.[143] In 2011, Wade was granted sole custody of his two children.[144][145] Wade also raises a nephew, the son of Wade's sister Deanna.[146][147] Wade began dating actress Gabrielle Union in 2008.[148][149] According to Wade, he and Union briefly split up at some point early in 2013 due to career demands.[147] During that time, Wade and Aja Metoyer conceived a child.[150][151] Wade and Union became engaged in December 2013[152] and married on August 30, 2014, in Miami.[153] On November 7, 2018, Wade became a father for the fourth time, when he and Union welcomed their daughter, who was born via surrogate.[154] In 2020, Wade's 12-year-old child came out as a transgender girl and changed her name to Zaya.[155][156][157] During an April 2023 interview, Wade said that he moved his family out of Florida partially due to the state's anti-LGBTQ policies.[158][159]\n\n\nWade's nicknames include D-Wade and Flash, which was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O'Neal who would sing, \"He's the greatest in the Universe\", in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film *Flash Gordon*.[160][161] The Heat's 2005 NBA playoffs run and Wade's performances while O'Neal was hampered by injury, led to media attention and rapid increase in Wade's popularity. During those playoffs, Wade's jersey became the league's top-selling jersey and remained so for nearly two years.[162] After the Heat's success and Wade's memorable performances during the 2006 NBA playoffs, Wade appeared on several talk shows, including *Late Show with David Letterman* and *Live with Regis and Kelly*.[163] He also made a guest star appearance on Disney Channel's *Austin & Ally* as himself, who is an obsessed fan of Austin Moon.[164]\n\n\nWade has been featured in magazine articles and publications. In 2005, he was featured on *People*'s 50 Most Beautiful People,[165] and in 2006 he was named the NBA's best-dressed player by *GQ*.[166] In 2007, *Esquire* named him to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year.[167][168] Wade's endorsement deals included Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials paired him with Charles Barkley), and Topps.[169] He had his own line of shoes with Converse named \"The Wade\" and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile.[170][171] During the 2009–10 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike's Jordan Brand.[172] Wade was chosen by Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining Anthony and Chris Paul, who had their own signature shoes. After his Jordan Brand contract expired in 2012, Wade signed with the Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning.[173] Wade was included in *Time*'s list of the 100 most influential people of 2020.[174] In April 2021, Wade became a minority owner of the Utah Jazz.[175] In October 2021, Wade's eldest son, Zaire Wade got drafted by the Salt Lake City Stars, which is the NBA G League affiliate of the Utah Jazz.\n\n\nIn March 2021, when asked about Michael Jordan, Wade stated that Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. He explained, \"I come from a Jordan era. I am biased and I'm going to be biased until the day I pass away. Michael Jordan will be my GOAT. I'm not taking anything away from LeBron. LeBron is amazing. But Michael Jordan is my GOAT.\" Wade stated that Michael Jordan was his favorite player growing up. He explained, \"For me, from Chicago, where I grew up, I made it out the hood because I seen a dude, No. 23, play the game of basketball at a level that I was like, I just want to do some of that.\"[176][177]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade is active in encouraging youth to develop their talents as seen in this talent search at the Chicago Theatre.\nWade is well known for his philanthropic involvement. In 2003, he founded The Wade's World Foundation, which provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health, and social skills for children in at-risk situations.[178] He hosts a variety of community outreach programs in Chicago and South Florida.[178] In 2008, he announced his partnership with former teammate Alonzo Mourning's charitable foundation and co-hosted ZO's Summer Groove, an annual summer event.[179][180] On December 24, 2008, Wade purchased a new home for a South Florida woman whose nephew accidentally burned down the family home.[181] In addition, Wade donated furnishings, clothing and gifts to the family.[181]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wade giving a present to a U.S. Army reservist during a 2009 pregame ceremony\nAfter breaking his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's victory to 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan who lost his hands and feet due to a bacterial infection.[182] Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia.[182] Wade is known for visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid the media spotlight.[182]\n\n\nIn September 2009, Wade donated money from his foundation to keep the Robbins, Illinois public library from having to shut down.[183] He handed library director Priscilla Coatney a $25,000 check in order to resurrect the building. In January 2010, Wade and Mourning co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti\",[184] which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three days after the fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the \"Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti\" had already raised over $800,000.[184] Wade stated, \"I expected nothing less from my friends and colleagues in the sports community, our commitment to this cause knows no bounds, and we will continue to accept any and all donations throughout the days ahead.\"[184] Wade is also an avid supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and served as an Ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative.[185]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nWade is a Christian and chose the number 3 throughout most of his career because it represents the Holy Trinity.[186][187] His mother, Jolinda, strengthened her ties to Christianity in 2001 after years of drug problems. She served as a minister during her final prison sentence in 2002 and 2003. She was ordained as a Baptist minister in January 2007 and formed the non-denominational Temple of Praise Binding and Loosing Ministry in Chicago. In May 2008, Wade purchased a church building for his mother's ministry.[188] He tithes 10% of his salary to his mother's church.[15]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Wade appeared as a role model on Season 3, Episode 13, of *Supernanny* and gave advice to the family's son.\n\n\nIn 2019, Wade appeared as a guest judge on season 14 of *America's Got Talent* alongside wife Gabrielle Union.[189]\nIn 2021, it was said that Wade will be the host of *The Cube*, which is currently aired on TBS.\n\n\n\n### 2020 tweet[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Wade tweeted in support of Nick Cannon, who was fired from ViacomCBS after making racist remarks and endorsing antisemitic conspiracy theories.[190] Following some backlash, Wade later deleted his tweet and clarified that he had expressed his support of \"[Cannon's ownership of] the content and [the] brand he helped create\", and affirmed that he has \"zero tolerance for any hate speech.\"[191]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Basketball portal\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association franchise career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff free throw scoring leaders\n* List of Olympic medalists in basketball\n* History of the Miami Heat\n* 2002–03 Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"YouTube\". *www.youtube.com*.\n2. **^** \"YouTube\". *www.youtube.com*.\n3. **^** \"Dwyane Wade Stats\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

If he was someone who I thought would never finish his degree, or someone who I thought didn't take his education seriously, then I would take issue with the jersey retiring,' said Paula Gillespie, associate professor of English.\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"Dwyane Wade: Biography.\" Archived January 17, 2007, at the Wayback Machine NBA.com.

Wade is also Miami's all-time leader in points, games, assists, steals, shots made, and shots taken.[5] Wade is widely regarded as one of the greatest shooting guards in NBA history.[6][7][8] Wade is currently the host of the American adaptation of *The Cube*.\n\n\nAfter a successful college basketball career with the Marquette Golden Eagles, including leading the team to the Final Four in 2003, Wade was drafted fifth overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Heat. In his third season, Wade led the Heat to their first NBA Championship and was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Wade led the United States men's basketball team, commonly known as the \"Redeem Team\", in scoring and helped them capture the gold medal. In the 2008–09 season, Wade led the league in both total points (2,386) and points per game (30.2), the latter stat earning him his sole NBA scoring title. Wade was selected as the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 2010. With LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Wade helped guide Miami to four consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 to 2014, and won back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. Wade briefly left Miami to play for the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers throughout 2016–2018 before returning to Miami to finish his playing career and retire with the Heat in 2019. The Heat retired his #3 jersey in 2020. He purchased a minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz in 2021. In October 2021, Wade was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[9] In 2023, it was announced that Wade would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nWade was born the second of two children to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr. in Chicago, Illinois, on January 17, 1982. Wade attributes the uncommon spelling of his and his father's first name to his grandmother.[11] JoLinda already had two children when she married Wade's father, and with him she had Dwyane and his older sister Tragil. The pair separated when Wade was four months old. Wade described his early childhood in the South Side of Chicago as trying.[12]\n\n\nWhen his parents divorced, JoLinda was given custody of the two children. JoLinda struggled with drug addiction and often committed crimes that sent her to prison. At eight years old, Tragil tricked her brother Dwyane into thinking they were going to the movies, only to take him to live with his father and stepmother. Wade visited his mother on occasion until his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois, after which Wade would not see her for two years.[13]\n\n\nWade turned to basketball and football, avoiding the temptations of drugs and gangs. Wade credited Tragil as the person most responsible for pointing him in the right direction.[14] Wade grew up idolizing Michael Jordan and modeled his game after him.[15] On October 14, 2001, as Wade's basketball career blossomed, JoLinda vowed to turn her life around. She says that she has not used drugs since 2003.[16]\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\nWade played basketball and football for Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. He immediately excelled as a wide receiver and also played as a backup quarterback, but success in basketball took longer.[14] He grew four inches by the start of his junior year and emerged as the team leader, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds.[17]\n\n\nWade's improvement continued into his senior year, when he averaged 27 points and 11 rebounds.[18] He led the Bulldogs to a 24–5 record and to a Class AA Eisenhower Sectional appearance. Wade set school records for points scored (676) and steals made (106).[19] He credited coach Jack Fitzgerald as a seminal and positive influence. Wade was recruited to play basketball only by Marquette, Illinois State, and DePaul, due to disqualifyingly low ACT scores.[13]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nWade committed to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to play under coach Tom Crean. In his freshman year, Wade was sidelined by NCAA Proposition 48, which set academic eligibility requirements for participation in Division I sports. Effort and tutoring[20] sufficiently raised his academic standing so that he became eligible by the start of his sophomore year.[21]\n\n\n\n### 2001–02 season[edit]\n\n\nWade led the Marquette Golden Eagles in scoring with 17.8 points (ppg) and led Conference USA in both steals per game with 2.47 and 2-point field goals made with 205;[22] he averaged 6.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists.[23] Marquette finished with a 26–7 record, their best since the 1993–94 season.[19]\n\n\n\n### 2002–03 season[edit]\n\n\nWade again led the school in scoring with 21.5 points and the Golden Eagles finished with a 27–6 record.[24] Three days after JoLinda was released from prison, she saw Wade play basketball for the first time in five years as Marquette upset the Cincinnati Bearcats, 70–61, to capture the Conference USA title on March 8, 2003. He helped bring the Golden Eagles to the Final Four for the first time since their 1977 national championship season. Wade was subsequently named to the All-America First Team by the Associated Press (AP), making him the first basketball player from Marquette to receive the distinction since 1978.[19]\n\n\nWade's performance during the Midwest Regional final drew national attention. Against a top-seeded Kentucky team, he delivered 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists, including a memorable breakaway dunk, as Marquette upset the Wildcats, 83–69, and advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1977. Wade's triple double was the fourth ever recorded in NCAA tournament history. The Golden Eagles finished their season as No.6 in the AP Poll, Marquette's highest ranking since 1976–77. Wade was named the MVP of the Midwest Regional. His performance earned him a high NBA draft projection.[25] As a result, Wade skipped his senior year to enter the 2003 NBA draft.\n\n\nMarquette retired his jersey on February 3, 2007. It ordinarily requires student-athletes to have graduated for jersey retirement, but made an exception for Wade.[26]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2003–2016)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie year (2003–04)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade dunking the ball during the 2004 Rookie Challenge game for the Rookies team\nSelected fifth in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, Wade became the highest ranked of only four Marquette first round draft picks.[27] Wade quickly emerged as a productive player, averaging 16.2 points on 46.5% shooting as well as 4 rebounds and 4.5 assists.[28] After a 5–15 start, the Heat gradually improved to finish 42–40 and qualify for the playoffs.[29] Wade served up outstanding postseason performances, particularly against the Indiana Pacers during the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[27] Wade earned a unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team[27] and finished third in Rookie of the Year voting (after LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony).[27] He placed among the top five rookies in several statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played.[27]\n\n\nIn the first playoff game, Wade hit a running jumper with 1.3 seconds left in the final quarter to give the Heat an 81–79 victory over the New Orleans Hornets. Winning that series 4–3, the Heat faced the Indiana Pacers, who were the top-seeded team with the best record in the NBA. The Heat lost the series 4–2. Wade became only the fourth rookie in the shot clock era to lead his team in points and assists during the postseason.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Breakthrough year (2004–05)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with the ball versus the Milwaukee Bucks in 2005\nThe Heat traded with the Los Angeles Lakers for center Shaquille O'Neal. Improving on their previous season's 42–40 record by 17 games, Miami went 59–23, leading the Eastern Conference.[30] Wade earned a reserve slot in the season's All-Star Game; adding 14 points in 24 minutes of play.[28]\n\n\nIn the first round of the 2005 playoffs, Wade averaged 26.3 points, 8.8 assists, and 6 rebounds a night while maintaining a 50% field-goal percentage as the Heat swept the New Jersey Nets.[31] In the second round he averaged 31 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists per game as the Heat swept the Washington Wizards.[31] The Heat lost the Eastern Conference Finals 4–3 to the Detroit Pistons, the previous season's champions. Wade scored 42 points in Game 2 and 36 in Game 3 despite playing with sinusitis, the flu, and a knee strain. He suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 that prevented him from playing in the sixth game and limited him in the seventh.[32][30]\n\n\n\n#### NBA champion and Finals MVP (2005–06)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade at the free throw line\nIn the 2005–06 season, Wade was elected to the All-Star Game as a starter. During 30 minutes of play, he put up 20 points on 9-of-11 field goals.[33] Wade finished the regular season averaging 27.2 points, 6.7 assists, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.95 steals.[34]\n\n\nIn the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Miami played the Chicago Bulls. Wade incurred several injuries, including a severely bruised hip during Game 5.[35] He scored 15 of his 28 points while suffering intense pain, to give the Heat a 3–2 series lead. Wade led Miami past the Detroit Pistons despite experiencing flu-like symptoms in Game 6.[36] In the series-clinching contest, he landed 14 points and 10 assists.[36]\n\n\nDuring the 2006 NBA Finals, Miami faced the Dallas Mavericks. Wade's 42, 36, and 43 points in Games 3, 4, and 5, respectively, helped the Heat go from a 0–2 deficit to a 3–2 series lead.[37] In Game 3, Wade's 42 points tied his playoff-high and his 13 rebounds were a career-high.[38][39] The Heat took Game 6 behind Wade's 36 points, taking the series 4–2, earning Wade the Finals MVP trophy.[40] He became the fifth-youngest player in NBA history to capture the Finals MVP award, and his 34.7 points were the Finals' third-highest among players in their first NBA Finals.[41] His 33.8 player efficiency rating (PER) over the NBA Finals was ranked by John Hollinger of ESPN as the best since the NBA-ABA merger.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Injuries and missing playoffs (2006–2008)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, Wade missed 31 games due to injury; even so, he was elected to his third consecutive All-Star Game and received All-NBA honors. He became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing 31 or more games since Pete Maravich.[27] The Heat struggled with injuries in general and were 20–25 on February 1, 2007.[43] Playing the Houston Rockets on February 21, 2007, Wade dislocated his left shoulder and left the court in a wheelchair.[44] Wade chose to delay surgery and instead rehabilitate his shoulder in time for the postseason.[45] After missing 23 games, Wade returned to the active roster. Sporting a black shoulder sleeve, Wade played 27 minutes and notched 12 points and 8 assists in the 111–103 overtime loss.[46] For the season, Wade averaged 27.4 points, 7.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.1 steals, while shooting 50% from the field; further, he finished the season as the NBA PER leader.[47]\n\n\nDuring the 2007 playoffs, Wade averaged 23.5 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.8 rebounds per contest, but were swept in the first round by the Chicago Bulls.[48] Post-playoffs, Wade underwent a pair of surgeries to repair his dislocated left shoulder and left knee, both of which proved successful. However, the knee ailment, commonly called \"jumper's knee\", prevented Wade from joining USA Basketball in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament over that summer.[49]\n\n\nAfter missing the Tournament of Americas' Olympic Qualifiers as well as the preseason and the first seven games, Wade began the 2007–08 season on November 14, 2007.[50] Despite battling pain in his injured knee throughout the season,[51] Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance.[52] However, the Heat held the worst record in the NBA. Wade's knee problems led Riley sit Wade for the final 21 games to undergo long overdue OssaTron treatment.[53] Wade averaged 24.6 points, 6.9 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.7 steals.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Scoring champion and playoff defeats (2008–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade dribbling the ball in 2009\nAfter months of rehab, he helped the U.S. National Team win gold at the 2008 Olympics, leading the team in scoring. Wade returned to the starting lineup to begin the 2008–09 campaign.[54][55] Early that season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to post at least 40 points, 10 assists and 5 blocks in one game since Alvan Adams in 1976–77.[56] Wade was elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star Game.[57]\n\n\nAfter the All-Star break, Wade recorded 50 points on 56.6% shooting along with 5 rebounds and 5 assists during a blow-out loss to the Orlando Magic;[58] making him the fourth in NBA history to score at least 50 points in a game that his team lost by at least 20.[58] In the very next contest, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and 7 rebounds.[59] Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring 50-plus points since Wilt Chamberlain.[60] Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record, scoring 24 points in the final quarter to secure a 120–115 win over the New York Knicks.[61] For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, plus 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocked shots.[61] In the next game he banked 40-points versus the Cleveland Cavaliers.[62] Wade put up 41 points on 53% shooting along with 9 assists, 7 steals, 7 rebounds and a block in the 107–100 loss.[62] The following game, Wade tied his career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, plus a steal and a block, as the Heat beat the Phoenix Suns 135–129.[63] Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with 30-plus points and 15 or more assists.[63] Less than a week later, Wade hit the buzzer-beater and tied his earlier franchise record with his 78th straight double-digit scoring game in double-overtime against the Chicago Bulls.[64] Wade finished the game with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes of play.[64] Wade joined Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to record that many points and that many assists in a single game while having as high of a field goal percentage.[65] Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning to become the Heat's all-time leading scorer in triple overtime versus the Utah Jazz.[66] Wade finished that 140–129 victory with 50 points to go along with his 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals and 2 blocks.[66]\n\n\nWade became the only player to reach 2,000 points, 500 assists, 150 steals, and 100 blocks as well as the only player under 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) to block upwards of 100 shots in a single season.[67][68] He became the fifth player to accumulate 2,000 points, 500 assists, and 150 steals in a season.[69] Wade helped the Heat clinch a playoff berth and become only the second team to make the postseason after winning 15 or fewer games the season before.[70] In a 122–105 victory over the New York Knicks, Wade recorded a career-high 55 points on 63% field goal shooting and added 9 rebounds and 4 assists.[71] Wade recorded 50 points in only three quarters and was pulled out of the game, one point shy of eclipsing Glen Rice's 56-point franchise record.[71] Wade averaged a league-leading 30.2 points for his first NBA scoring title. He added 7.5 assists, 5 rebounds, 2.2 steals, and 1.3 blocks.[47] Wade wrapped up the season with higher point, assist, steal, and block averages than James and Kobe Bryant, both of whom finished ahead of Wade in the MVP race.\n\n\nOn November 1, in what was only his third game of the 2009–10 season, Wade recorded his 10,000th career point during a 95–87 win against the Chicago Bulls.[72] On November 12, Wade made a spectacular dunk over Cavalier Anderson Varejão. James regarded the dunk as \"great, probably top 10 all-time\".[73] Two days later against the New Jersey Nets, Wade hit another buzzer beater for a one-point win at 81–80.[74] On January 6, Wade scored a season-high 44 points during an overtime loss to the Boston Celtics, the most in a losing effort that season.[75] Wade appeared in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game.[76] Wade was named the game's MVP with 28 points, 11 assists, 5 steals and 6 rebounds.[77]\n\n\nOn February 17, Wade strained his calf. He left the game, ending his personal and the Heat's franchise-record streak of 148 consecutive games with at least 10 points.[78] Wade was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for the fifth time and Player of the Week twice for his play in the month of March. He averaged 26.9 and 7.5 assists, both of which ranked third in the Eastern Conference, and 2.3 steals per game, which ranked first. Wade recorded six 30-point games and had six double-doubles in the month, including a season-high 14 assists.[79]\n\n\nFor the season, Wade averaged 26.6 points on 47.6% field goal shooting to go with 6.5 assists, 4.8 rebounds, 1.8 steals and 1.1 blocks; doing so, he led his team to a 47–35 record and the fifth playoff seed.[47] In the first round, down 0–3 against the Boston Celtics, Wade recorded a career playoff and franchise record with 46 points; he outscored the entire Celtics team in the fourth quarter.[80] It was Wade's sixth career playoff game with at least 40 points.[47] Despite his averaging 33.2 points on 56.4% shooting, 6.8 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1.6 blocks per contest, the Heat fell to Boston in five games.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Big Three era and back-to-back championships (2010–2014)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with his teammate LeBron James\nDuring the off-season, the Miami-Dade County commission renamed the area \"Miami-Wade County\" from July 1 to 7, a week that coincided with the start of free agency, intended to help convince Wade to stay with the Heat.[82] On July 7, it was announced that Wade would sign with Miami, along with Toronto Raptor star Chris Bosh.[83] The following day, LeBron James announced he would join the Heat.[84]\n\n\nIn the first year of the Big 3 Era, the Heat finished with a 58–24 record and earned the second seed in the Eastern Conference. Wade averaged 25.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 1.5 steals while shooting 50%. After defeating the Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics, and Chicago Bulls, the Heat reached the NBA Finals but ultimately fell to the Dallas Mavericks in six games. Wade averaged 26.5 points, 7 rebounds, and 5.2 assists for the Finals and 24.5 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.4 assists for the playoffs.[85]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2012, Wade recorded the third triple-double in the history of the All-Star Game, posting 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, joining Jordan and James. On March 10, 2012, Wade made the game-winning shot against the Indiana Pacers, giving the Heat a 93–91 overtime win. Wade finished the season averaging 22.1 points, 4.8 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals. The Heat defeated the New York Knicks in 5 games and the Indiana Pacers in six games. In Game 6 of the second round, Wade recorded 41 points and 10 rebounds.[86] The Heat prevailed in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals, beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games. Wade averaged 22.6 points. The Heat became the first team in NBA history to win a championship after trailing in three playoff series.\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2012–13 season, Wade underwent left knee surgery, missing the 2012 Summer Olympics.[87][88] On December 26, 2012, playing the Charlotte Bobcats, Wade kicked guard Ramon Sessions in the groin. The following day, Wade was suspended by the NBA for one game.[89] Wade finished the 2012–2013 season with averages of 21.2 points, 5 rebounds and 5.1 assists.\n\n\nIn the playoffs, injuries limited Wade to a career-low scoring average of 15.9 points per game, but he upped his average to 19.6 points during the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. After the teams split the first two games in Miami, the Spurs took Game 3. In Game 4, Wade scored 32 points on 56 percent shooting to go with 6 steals as the Heat won 109–93. The Spurs took Game 5 despite Wade's 25 points and 10 assists. Wade scored 14 points in Miami's overtime win in Game 6, followed by 23 points and 10 rebounds in Game 7 as the Heat clinched their second straight championship and Wade's third title.[90][91]\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Wade missed 28 games from injuries and the team's decision to rest him during \"back-to-back\" games. Wade averaged 19 points and posted a career-high 54% field goal percentage. In the playoffs, the team increased Wade's minutes, highlighted by a 28-point performance in Miami's second-round victory over the Brooklyn Nets and a 23-point outing in a road victory against Indiana in the Eastern Finals. The Heat won the series in six games, advancing to their fourth straight NBA Finals. Wade averaged 19.1 points on 52 percent shooting, his best playoff percentage since 2010. The Heat lost to the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 NBA Finals in five games.\n\n\n\n#### Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade making a lay-up for the Heat in 2015\nOn June 28, 2014, Wade and teammates James and Bosh all opted out of their contracts in order to cut costs, but intended to re-sign.[92] James then announced that he was returning to Cleveland. Wade re-signed with the Heat,[93] joined by Bosh, Udonis Haslem, Chris Andersen and Mario Chalmers as well as former rivals Danny Granger and Luol Deng.\n\n\nIn the 2014–15 season, Wade missed seven consecutive games due to a hamstring injury.[94] On December 17, 2014, he scored a season-high 42 points, his highest total in almost four years, but Miami lost 105–87 to Utah.[95] He was again named an All-Star but pulled out due to another hamstring injury.[96] The Heat finished the season with a 37–45 record, as Wade missed the postseason for just the second time.\n\n\nOn June 29, 2015, Wade opted out of his contract,[97] but then signed a one-year, $20 million contract.[98] Wade hit just seven 3-point shots during the 2015–16 regular season. However, in the 2016 postseason, Wade converted on his first seven three-point shot attempts. Wade had never made more than five three-pointers in a row.[99]\n\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls (2016–2017)[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Wade joined his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls, on a two-year deal worth approximately $47 million.[100][101] Initially, the Heat offered a two-year, $20 million contract,[102] before increasing it to a two-year, $40 million offer, both of which Wade felt were unacceptable.[103][104] The relationship ended badly with Wade and the Heat squabbling.\n\n\nWade teamed with Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo in Chicago.[105] In January 2017, the trio were all fined for criticizing their young teammates' effort. In March 2017, Wade sustained a fractured elbow,[105] returning for the playoffs,[105] but the Bulls were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics in the first round.[106]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2017–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade with the Cavs in 2017\nOn September 24, 2017, three months after trading Butler and waiving Rondo, the Bulls reached an agreement on a buyout with Wade.[105] Three days later, Wade signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, reuniting him with Miami Heat teammate LeBron James.[107] During the season, Wade objected to coach Tyronn Lue's plan to play him off the bench. Wade started for the Cavaliers in the first three games, but shot only 7-for-25. After a blowout loss to the Orlando Magic in the third game, Wade volunteered to take a bench role, becoming leader of the second unit.[108]\n\n\n\n### Return to Miami (2018–2019)[edit]\n\n\nOn February 8, 2018, at the NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster.[109] Acquiring guards Jordan Clarkson, George Hill and Rodney Hood, the Cavaliers[109] traded Wade back to the Miami Heat in exchange for a protected 2024 second-round draft pick.[110] At the funeral of Wade's long-time agent Henry Thomas in January, Wade mended relations with Riley. On February 9, in his first game, Wade was garnered a standing ovation and came off the bench in a 91–85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[111] On February 27, Wade scored a season-high 27 points as the Heat rallied to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 102–101. On April 3, in a 101–98 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Wade reached 5,000 assists in a Heat uniform, becoming the ninth player to score 20,000 points and collect 5,000 assists with one team, joining Karl Malone, Bryant, Jordan, James, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West.[112] On April 16, Wade scored 28 points to end the 76ers' 17-game winning streak and lead the Heat to a 113–103 Game 2 win over Philadelphia and even the first-round playoff series. He passed Larry Bird for 10th on the NBA's career postseason scoring list.[113]\n\n\nIn the off-season, Wade announced his intentions to retire after the 2018–19 season,[114][115][116] re-signing with the Heat on September 18.[117] He missed seven games in mid-November due to the birth of his daughter.[118] On November 25, Wade scored a season-high 35 points, the most ever by a Miami bench player.[119] On December 9, he scored 25 points in his 1,000th career game.[120] On January 6, 2019, Wade became the third player in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 5,000 assists, 4,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals, 800 blocks and 500 three-pointers.[121] Wade was named by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver as a special roster addition for the 2019 All-Star game, thus marking his 13th All-Star appearance.[122] Wade had received the second-most fan votes for guards in the Eastern Conference.[123] On April 9, Wade played his last home game in Miami, scoring 30 points.[124] In his final game the following night, Wade recorded his fifth career triple-double with 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.[125][126]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2020, the Heat announced that Wade's No. 3 jersey would be retired on February 22.[127]\n\n\n\n## NBA executive career[edit]\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Miami, Wade had discussed the potential for a future ownership stake in the Heat franchise but Wade was unable to commit at the time, according to Heat owner Micky Arison.[128]\n\n\nOn April 16, 2021, it was announced that Wade had purchased an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz franchise of the NBA, joining an ownership group led by his personal friend and associate, Ryan Smith, the Jazz majority owner and team governor. Wade is a member of a small ownership group that includes Smith, his wife Ashley, investor and Accel partner Ryan Sweeney, Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and the Miller family, which previously owned the team.[4]\n\n\n\n\n> \"This goes way beyond the dream I had to just play basketball in the NBA. I've seen Shaq do it in Sacramento. I've seen Grant Hill do it in Atlanta. I've seen Jordan do it in Charlotte. If this partnership is going to be anything like my relationship is with Ryan, there are going to be a lot of things that I'll want to be involved in. [...] Unfortunately, people in my community don't get this opportunity, and I do not take it lightly to have this opportunity. To make real change, this is where you have to be -- at the top -- and Ryan knows that. I'm thankful for him, and I know too that I bring a lot to this partnership outside of just my basketball knowledge and skills.\n> \n> — Dwyane Wade on purchasing an ownership stake in the Jazz[4]\n> \n\n\nWade said in the announcement of his purchase that he hoped to take a hands-on approach to his involvement, and highlighted his close brother-like relationship with Jazz star Donovan Mitchell, who he called the player most like him and \"2.0\".[4]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade shooting a free-throw against China during the 2008 Olympics\nWade was a member of the 2004 Olympic team, which won a bronze medal in Athens. The team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, in which Wade averaged 19.3 points per game.[129] The U.S. national team won a bronze medal.[130] Wade was named to the national team roster from 2006 to 2008; and, together with James and Anthony, Wade co-captained the 2006 team.[131]\n\n\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics, the United States went undefeated and captured gold medal honors after beating Spain, the 2006 World champions. Wade, who led the team in scoring, tallied a game-high 27 points in 27 minutes on 75% field goal shooting and added 4 steals, 2 assists, and 2 rebounds.[132] Wade averaged a team-high 16 points in 18 minutes on 67% field goal shooting, 4 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2.3 steals, as the U.S. lived up to their Redeem Team moniker and claimed gold medal honors for the first time since 2000.[132][133]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade's pre-game ritual consisted of doing pull-ups at the rim.\nListed at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall and weighing 220 pounds (100 kg), Wade was a shooting guard who could play point as he did during his rookie season and with smaller lineups. On offense, he was one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in NBA history. Wade's signature one-two step allowed him to dash past bigger defenders and draw fouls.[134] Wade ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. Wade was an unselfish player, averaging 5.4 assists for his career.[34] After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the league's premier clutch players.[135]\n\n\nDavid Thorpe, an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players, cited Wade's post-up game as one of his strengths.[136] Thorpe said that Wade's best moves from the post were his turnaround jump shot,[136] double pivot,[136] and what Thorpe termed a \"freeze fake\",[137] a pump fake Wade used to get his opponent to jump, so that he could drive around him.[137] Wade's main weakness was three-point shooting; he averaged 29% for his career.[34]\n\n\nWade was best known for his ability to convert difficult lay-ups, even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders.[134] His style drew concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner,[134] as Wade had hurt his knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players. Wade established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals.[138] He holds the NBA record for blocks by players listed 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and under, which he achieved in only 679 games; this is over 400 games less than the previous record-holder Dennis Johnson (1,100).[139]\n\n\nIn 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Wade as the 28th greatest player in NBA history.[140]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |

girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches in 2002. They split in 2007, and he divorced her in 2010 after an acrimonious court battle.[143] In 2011, Wade was granted sole custody of his two children.[144][145] Wade also raises a nephew, the son of Wade's sister Deanna.[146][147] Wade began dating actress Gabrielle Union in 2008.[148][149] According to Wade, he and Union briefly split up at some point early in 2013 due to career demands.[147] During that time, Wade and Aja Metoyer conceived a child.[150][151] Wade and Union became engaged in December 2013[152] and married on August 30, 2014, in Miami.[153] On November 7, 2018, Wade became a father for the fourth time, when he and Union welcomed their daughter, who was born via surrogate.[154] In 2020, Wade's 12-year-old child came out as a transgender girl and changed her name to Zaya.[155][156][157] During an April 2023 interview, Wade said that he moved his family out of Florida partially due to the state's anti-LGBTQ policies.[158][159]\n\n\nWade's nicknames include D-Wade and Flash, which was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O'Neal who would sing, \"He's the greatest in the Universe\", in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film *Flash Gordon*.[160][161] The Heat's 2005 NBA playoffs run and Wade's performances while O'Neal was hampered by injury, led to media attention and rapid increase in Wade's popularity. During those playoffs, Wade's jersey became the league's top-selling jersey and remained so for nearly two years.[162] After the Heat's success and Wade's memorable performances during the 2006 NBA playoffs, Wade appeared on several talk shows, including *Late Show with David Letterman* and *Live with Regis and Kelly*.[163] He also made a guest star appearance on Disney Channel's *Austin & Ally* as himself, who is an obsessed fan of Austin Moon.[164]\n\n\nWade has been featured in magazine articles and publications. In 2005, he was featured on *People*'s 50 Most Beautiful People,[165] and in 2006 he was named the NBA's best-dressed player by *GQ*.[166] In 2007, *Esquire* named him to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year.[167][168] Wade's endorsement deals included Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials paired him with Charles Barkley), and Topps.[169] He had his own line of shoes with Converse named \"The Wade\" and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile.[170][171] During the 2009–10 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike's Jordan Brand.[172] Wade was chosen by Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining Anthony and Chris Paul, who had their own signature shoes.

He explained, \"I come from a Jordan era. I am biased and I'm going to be biased until the day I pass away. Michael Jordan will be my GOAT. I'm not taking anything away from LeBron. LeBron is amazing. But Michael Jordan is my GOAT.\" Wade stated that Michael Jordan was his favorite player growing up. He explained, \"For me, from Chicago, where I grew up, I made it out the hood because I seen a dude, No. 23, play the game of basketball at a level that I was like, I just want to do some of that.\"[176][177]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade is active in encouraging youth to develop their talents as seen in this talent search at the Chicago Theatre.\nWade is well known for his philanthropic involvement.

Hardaway played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Golden State Warriors, Miami Heat, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers. He was a five-time NBA All-Star and All-NBA Team selection. Hardaway won a gold medal with the United States national basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics. He was known for his crossover dribble which was dubbed the \"UTEP two-step\" by television analysts.\n\n\nHe is the father of current NBA player Tim Hardaway Jr.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was born in Chicago, Illinois, and he graduated from Carver Area High School in 1985.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway played college basketball for the UTEP Miners under head coach Don Haskins, a future member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nHardaway was twice named MVP of El Paso's Sun Bowl Invitational Tournament, in 1987 and 1988. He played on teams that went to the NCAA Tournaments in 1988 and 1989. He won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award in 1989 as the best college player in the nation six feet (1.83 m) tall or under. While playing for the Miners, Hardaway developed his crossover dribble move that was called the \"UTEP two-step\".[2]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

In his rookie season, Hardaway wore number *5* on his jersey, as Manute Bol wore Hardaway's *10*. After Bol left the Warriors, Hardaway acquired the number. Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin formed a trio known as Run TMC (the initials of the players' first names and a play on the name of the popular rap group Run-DMC). As part of the Warriors' attack, Hardaway was responsible for leading Run TMC's fast break, displaying his excellent passing and one-on-one skills to complement Richmond's slashing and Mullin's shooting.\n\n\nGolden State made the playoffs during the 1990–91 season, Hardaway's second season and his first season in the playoffs. In the first round, the 7th seeded Warriors defeated the 2nd seeded San Antonio Spurs led by All-Star David Robinson in 4 games to advance to face the 3rd seeded Los Angeles Lakers led by NBA legend Magic Johnson. The Warriors managed to steal a game on the road in game 2, but could not defeat the more experienced Lakers, falling in five games despite Hardaway averaging 26.8 points, 12.8 assists and 3.8 steals for the series.\n\n\nHardaway averaged a career-high 23.4 points a game in the 1991–92 season, as the Warriors fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. The following season Hardaway averaged a career-high 10.6 assists a game to get with his scoring average of 21.5, but the Warriors did not make the playoffs and would not return to postseason action for the remainder of Hardaway's tenure with the team.\n\n\nAs a Warrior, Hardaway made the NBA All-Star Game three straight years, and a knee injury kept him out of the entire 1993–94 season. He reached 5,000 points and 2,500 assists faster than any other NBA player except Oscar Robertson. Hardaway played for the Warriors until the middle of 1995–96 season when he was traded to the Miami Heat along with Chris Gatling in exchange for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1996–2001)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the mid-season trade to Miami, Hardaway started 28 games to finish the season, averaging 17.2 points a game with 10 assists. Miami made the playoffs but were swept in the first round by the 72 win Chicago Bulls. The following season was a huge success for Miami and for Hardaway, as he finished 4th in voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, was selected to the All-NBA First Team as Miami won a franchise record 61 wins.\n\n\nHardaway started in 81 games, averaging 20.3 points, 8.6 assists, while placing fourth in the league with 203 three-point baskets. He also played in the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, scoring 10 points in 14 minutes. In the playoffs, Hardaway averaged 26 points a game as the Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in the first round in 5 games, and then defeated the New York Knicks in 7 games in the semifinals, in which Hardaway scored 38 points in the 7th game. Miami would once again fall to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in 5 games.\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Hardaway averaged 18.9 points and 8.3 assist per game, and was selected to play in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Heat won 55 games and won the Atlantic Division, but lost to the Knicks in 5 games in the first round of the playoffs. In the lockout shortened 1998–99 season, he averaged 17.4 points a game with 7.3 assists, and Miami won the Atlantic Division again but could once again not defeat the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs despite having home court advantage and the Knicks being the 8th seed in the playoffs.\n\n\nHardaway's production slipped in the 1999–2000 season, with Alonzo Mourning and Jamal Mashburn carrying more of the offensive load. Hardaway averaged 13.4 points with 7.4 assists a game, but shot a personal best .367 percent from beyond the three-point arc. After playing just 52 games, Hardaway was further limited in the playoffs, as Miami defeated the Detroit Pistons but once again fell to New York in 7 games.\n\n\nThat summer, Hardaway and Mourning won a gold medal playing for the U.S.A. men's basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Before the 2000–01 season Mourning would be diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, and would be sidelined for much of the season. Hardaway upped his offensive production to 14.9 points a game with 6.3 assists a game as Miami won 50 games and captured the East's third best record, only to be swept in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\n\n\n### Dallas Mavericks (2001–2002)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2000–01 season, and with his skills declining with age, Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on August 22, 2001, for a second-round draft pick. He was at one time Miami's all-time leader in assists. With Dallas, Hardaway was mainly utilized off the bench, starting only two games out of 54 and averaging almost ten points a game. In the middle of the season, he was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for point guard Nick Van Exel.\n\n\n\n### Denver Nuggets (2002)[edit]\n\n\nWith the Nuggets he started all 14 games he played with them before retiring and becoming a basketball analyst for ESPN.\n\n\nWhile playing for the Nuggets, Hardaway was suspended for two games and fined $10,000 by the league when he threw a television monitor onto the court.[3]\n\n\n\n### Indiana Pacers (2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 2003, Hardaway signed a contract with the Indiana Pacers, and in his first game registered a season-high 14 points and seven assists against the Chicago Bulls. By the end of his career, Hardaway competed in five NBA All-Star Games.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### Detroit Pistons (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 7, 2014, it was announced that Hardaway was named an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons.[4]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was the 1989 WAC Player of the Year. He recorded 5,000 points and 2,500 assists, second fastest in NBA history after Oscar Robertson. Hardaway accomplished it in 262 games; Robertson took only 247.[5] He held the record for most assists in Miami Heat franchise history with 1,947,[5] until his total was surpassed by Dwyane Wade on January 16, 2010.\n\n\nHardaway shares the record for second most steals in an NBA playoffs game, with 8 in Game 2 of the 1991 Western Conference Semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers and in Game 4 of the 1992 Western Conference First Round against the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1991–92, Hardaway became the 7th player in NBA history to average 20 points (23.4 ppg) and 10 assists (10.0 apg) in a season, a feat he accomplished again in 1992–93 (21.5 ppg, 10.6 apg).[5]\n\n\nHardaway holds the NBA record for the worst single-game shooting performance in NBA history, going 0-for-17 in a 106–102 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 27, 1991.[6] Hardaway holds the Miami Heat's all-time record in 3-point field goals made, with 806. His number 10 was retired by the Miami Heat on October 28, 2009. On April 2, 2022, Hardaway was announced as one of thirteen members to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame for the Class of 2022 later this year.[7]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was originally selected to play for \"Dream Team II\" in the 1994 FIBA World Championship but was replaced after suffering a torn knee ligament.[8]\n\n\nHe was also selected (as one of the last two players selected) for the 1998 FIBA World Championship team. The team was later replaced with CBA and college players due to the NBA lockout.[9]\n\n\nIn 2000, he played in the Sydney Olympics, scoring 5.5 points/Game and shooting .385 (15–39) from the field.[10]\n\n\nHardaway was a player/head coach of the Florida Pit Bulls of the ABA in 2006.[11][12]\n\n\nIn September 2009, he played for the NBA Generations team in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge, a series of exhibitions against Korean Basketball League and Philippine Basketball Association players.[13]\n\n\n\n## Homophobia controversy[edit]\n\n\nDuring a February 14, 2007, interview on Miami's *The Dan Le Batard Show*, in response to the coming out of former NBA player John Amaechi, Hardaway remarked that he would try to distance himself from a player he knew was homosexual. When asked by the radio show host whether he realized that his remarks were homophobic, Hardaway responded by saying: \"Well, you know I hate gay people, so I let it be known. I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States.\" He also said that if he found out he had one or more gay teammates, he would try to get them fired.[14][15]\n\n\nLater in the day, Hardaway apologized for the remarks during a telephone interview with Fox affiliate WSVN in Miami. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said I hate gay people or anything like that.\"[16] He further apologized on February 15 in a statement released by his agent.[17]\n\n\nOn the same day, the NBA responded to Hardaway's comments by removing him from its All-Star Weekend activities later that week.[17] His employer, Trinity Sports, owner of the Anderson-based CBA Indiana Alley Cats, dismissed him from his position as Chief Basketball Operations Advisor,[18] and the CBA issued a statement distancing itself from Hardaway's remarks.[19]\n\n\nIn a September 2007 interview, Hardaway spoke about his February comments, saying he \"had no idea how much I hurt people. A lot of people.\" He described the controversy as \"the biggest bump [in the road] in my life\", and added, \"I'm going to do whatever I can to correct it. That's all I can do.\"[20]\n\n\nIn an interview on February 11, 2010, on Hardcore Sports Radio on Sirius, Hardaway spoke about his recent work with The Trevor Project and The YES Institute, which he has done to educate himself on LGBT issues.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2013, when Jason Collins came out as the first active openly gay male player in a major American professional team sport, Collins said that Hardaway called him in support of his homosexuality.[21] In July 2013, Hardaway was the symbolic first signer of a petition to put a proposed amendment to the Florida State Constitution overturning Florida Amendment 2 and allowing same-sex marriage in his home state of Florida on the ballot in 2014.[22]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway and his wife Yolanda reside in Michigan. They have a son, Tim Jr., and daughters, Nia and Nina.[5][23] Tim Jr. was drafted by the New York Knicks in 2013, and currently plays for the Dallas Mavericks.[24]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989–90 | Golden State | 79 | 78 | 33.7 | .471 | .274 | .764 | 3.9 | 8.7 | 2.1 | **.2** | 14.7\n |\n| 1990–91 | Golden State | **82** | **82** | 39.2 | **.476** | **.385** | .803 | **4.0** | 9.7 | **2.6** | .1 | 22.9\n |\n| 1991–92 | Golden State | 81 | 81 | **41.1** | .461 | .338 | .766 | 3.8 | 10.0 | 2.0 | **.2** | **23.4** |\n| 1992–93 | Golden State | 66 | 66 | 39.5 | .447 | .330 | .744 | **4.0** | **10.6** | 1.8 | .**2** | 21.5\n |\n| 1994–95 | Golden State | 62 | 62 | 37.4 | .427 | .378 | .760 | 3.1 | 9.3 | 1.4 | **.2** | 20.1\n |\n| 1995–96 | Golden State | 52 | 18 | 28.6 | .421 | .366 | .769 | 2.5 | 6.9 | 1.4 | **.2** | 14.1\n |\n| 1995–96 | Miami | 28 | 28 | 37.4 | .425 | .361 | .821 | 3.5 | 10.0 | 1.0 | **.2** | 17.2\n |\n| 1996–97 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 38.7 | .415 | .344 | .799 | 3.4 | 8.6 | 1.9 | .1 | 20.3\n |\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 37.4 | .431 | .351 | .781 | 3.7 | 8.3 | 1.7 | **.2** | 18.9\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 48 | 48 | 36.9 | .400 | .360 | .812 | 3.2 | 7.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 17.4\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | 52 | 52 | 32.2 | .386 | .367 | .827 | 2.9 | 7.4 | .9 | .1 | 13.4\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 77 | 77 | 33.9 | .392 | .366 | .801 | 2.6 | 6.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 14.9\n |\n| 2001–02 | Dallas | 54 | 2 | 23.6 | .362 | .341 | **.833** | 1.8 | 3.7 | .4 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Denver | 14 | 14 | 23.2 | .373 | .373 | .632 | 1.9 | 5.5 | 1.2 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2002–03 | Indiana | 10 | 0 | 12.7 | .367 | .355 | .500 | 1.5 | 2.4 | .9 | .0 | 4.9\n |\n| Career\n | 867 | 770 | 35.3 | .431 | .355 | .782 | 3.3 | 8.2 | 1.6 | .1 | 17.7\n |\n| All-Star\n | 5 | 0 | 16.8 | .386 | .381 | .786 | 2.6 | 4.6 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 10.6\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1991 | Golden State | 9 | 9 | 44.0 | **.486** | .354 | .789 | 3.7 | **11.2** | 3.1 | **.8** | 25.2\n |\n| 1992 | Golden State | 4 | 4 | 44.0 | .400 | .345 | .649 | 3.8 | 7.3 | **3.3** | .0 | 24.5\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 36.7 | .465 | .364 | .714 | 1.7 | 5.7 | 1.0 | .0 | 17.7\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | **17** | **17** | 41.2 | .359 | .313 | **.795** | **4.1** | 7.0 | 1.6 | .1 | 18.7\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 5 | 5 | **44.4** | .447 | **.436** | .784 | 3.4 | 6.6 | 1.2 | .0 | **26.0** |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 36.4 | .268 | .200 | .625 | 2.8 | 6.4 | 1.0 | .2 | 9.0\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 7 | 7 | 26.0 | .294 | .206 | .700 | 2.1 | 4.7 | .7 | .0 | 7.7\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 2 | 2 | 18.0 | .222 | .333 | .000 | 1.0 | 4.5 | .0 | .0 | 2.5\n |\n| 2003 | Indiana | 4 | 0 | 11.8 | .333 | .300 | .000 | .5 | 2.3 | .3 | .0 | 3.3\n |\n| Career\n | 56 | 52 | 36.6 | .393 | .320 | .751 | 3.1 | 6.8 | 1.6 | .2 | 16.8\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Tim Hardaway Stats\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

Hardaway played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Golden State Warriors, Miami Heat, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers. He was a five-time NBA All-Star and All-NBA Team selection. Hardaway won a gold medal with the United States national basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics. He was known for his crossover dribble which was dubbed the \"UTEP two-step\" by television analysts.\n\n\nHe is the father of current NBA player Tim Hardaway Jr.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was born in Chicago, Illinois, and he graduated from Carver Area High School in 1985.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway played college basketball for the UTEP Miners under head coach Don Haskins, a future member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nHardaway was twice named MVP of El Paso's Sun Bowl Invitational Tournament, in 1987 and 1988. He played on teams that went to the NCAA Tournaments in 1988 and 1989. He won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award in 1989 as the best college player in the nation six feet (1.83 m) tall or under. While playing for the Miners, Hardaway developed his crossover dribble move that was called the \"UTEP two-step\".[2]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

In his rookie season, Hardaway wore number *5* on his jersey, as Manute Bol wore Hardaway's *10*. After Bol left the Warriors, Hardaway acquired the number. Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin formed a trio known as Run TMC (the initials of the players' first names and a play on the name of the popular rap group Run-DMC). As part of the Warriors' attack, Hardaway was responsible for leading Run TMC's fast break, displaying his excellent passing and one-on-one skills to complement Richmond's slashing and Mullin's shooting.\n\n\nGolden State made the playoffs during the 1990–91 season, Hardaway's second season and his first season in the playoffs. In the first round, the 7th seeded Warriors defeated the 2nd seeded San Antonio Spurs led by All-Star David Robinson in 4 games to advance to face the 3rd seeded Los Angeles Lakers led by NBA legend Magic Johnson. The Warriors managed to steal a game on the road in game 2, but could not defeat the more experienced Lakers, falling in five games despite Hardaway averaging 26.8 points, 12.8 assists and 3.8 steals for the series.\n\n\nHardaway averaged a career-high 23.4 points a game in the 1991–92 season, as the Warriors fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. The following season Hardaway averaged a career-high 10.6 assists a game to get with his scoring average of 21.5, but the Warriors did not make the playoffs and would not return to postseason action for the remainder of Hardaway's tenure with the team.\n\n\nAs a Warrior, Hardaway made the NBA All-Star Game three straight years, and a knee injury kept him out of the entire 1993–94 season. He reached 5,000 points and 2,500 assists faster than any other NBA player except Oscar Robertson. Hardaway played for the Warriors until the middle of 1995–96 season when he was traded to the Miami Heat along with Chris Gatling in exchange for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1996–2001)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the mid-season trade to Miami, Hardaway started 28 games to finish the season, averaging 17.2 points a game with 10 assists. Miami made the playoffs but were swept in the first round by the 72 win Chicago Bulls. The following season was a huge success for Miami and for Hardaway, as he finished 4th in voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, was selected to the All-NBA First Team as Miami won a franchise record 61 wins.\n\n\nHardaway started in 81 games, averaging 20.3 points, 8.6 assists, while placing fourth in the league with 203 three-point baskets. He also played in the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, scoring 10 points in 14 minutes. In the playoffs, Hardaway averaged 26 points a game as the Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in the first round in 5 games, and then defeated the New York Knicks in 7 games in the semifinals, in which Hardaway scored 38 points in the 7th game. Miami would once again fall to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in 5 games.\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Hardaway averaged 18.9 points and 8.3 assist per game, and was selected to play in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Heat won 55 games and won the Atlantic Division, but lost to the Knicks in 5 games in the first round of the playoffs. In the lockout shortened 1998–99 season, he averaged 17.4 points a game with 7.3 assists, and Miami won the Atlantic Division again but could once again not defeat the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs despite having home court advantage and the Knicks being the 8th seed in the playoffs.\n\n\nHardaway's production slipped in the 1999–2000 season, with Alonzo Mourning and Jamal Mashburn carrying more of the offensive load. Hardaway averaged 13.4 points with 7.4 assists a game, but shot a personal best .367 percent from beyond the three-point arc. After playing just 52 games, Hardaway was further limited in the playoffs, as Miami defeated the Detroit Pistons but once again fell to New York in 7 games.\n\n\nThat summer, Hardaway and Mourning won a gold medal playing for the U.S.A. men's basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Before the 2000–01 season Mourning would be diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, and would be sidelined for much of the season. Hardaway upped his offensive production to 14.9 points a game with 6.3 assists a game as Miami won 50 games and captured the East's third best record, only to be swept in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\n\n\n### Dallas Mavericks (2001–2002)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2000–01 season, and with his skills declining with age, Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on August 22, 2001, for a second-round draft pick. He was at one time Miami's all-time leader in assists. With Dallas, Hardaway was mainly utilized off the bench, starting only two games out of 54 and averaging almost ten points a game. In the middle of the season, he was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for point guard Nick Van Exel.\n\n\n\n### Denver Nuggets (2002)[edit]\n\n\nWith the Nuggets he started all 14 games he played with them before retiring and becoming a basketball analyst for ESPN.\n\n\nWhile playing for the Nuggets, Hardaway was suspended for two games and fined $10,000 by the league when he threw a television monitor onto the court.[3]\n\n\n\n### Indiana Pacers (2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 2003, Hardaway signed a contract with the Indiana Pacers, and in his first game registered a season-high 14 points and seven assists against the Chicago Bulls. By the end of his career, Hardaway competed in five NBA All-Star Games.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### Detroit Pistons (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 7, 2014, it was announced that Hardaway was named an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons.[4]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was the 1989 WAC Player of the Year. He recorded 5,000 points and 2,500 assists, second fastest in NBA history after Oscar Robertson. Hardaway accomplished it in 262 games; Robertson took only 247.[5] He held the record for most assists in Miami Heat franchise history with 1,947,[5] until his total was surpassed by Dwyane Wade on January 16, 2010.\n\n\nHardaway shares the record for second most steals in an NBA playoffs game, with 8 in Game 2 of the 1991 Western Conference Semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers and in Game 4 of the 1992 Western Conference First Round against the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1991–92, Hardaway became the 7th player in NBA history to average 20 points (23.4 ppg) and 10 assists (10.0 apg) in a season, a feat he accomplished again in 1992–93 (21.5 ppg, 10.6 apg).[5]\n\n\nHardaway holds the NBA record for the worst single-game shooting performance in NBA history, going 0-for-17 in a 106–102 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 27, 1991.[6] Hardaway holds the Miami Heat's all-time record in 3-point field goals made, with 806. His number 10 was retired by the Miami Heat on October 28, 2009. On April 2, 2022, Hardaway was announced as one of thirteen members to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame for the Class of 2022 later this year.[7]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was originally selected to play for \"Dream Team II\" in the 1994 FIBA World Championship but was replaced after suffering a torn knee ligament.[8]\n\n\nHe was also selected (as one of the last two players selected) for the 1998 FIBA World Championship team. The team was later replaced with CBA and college players due to the NBA lockout.[9]\n\n\nIn 2000, he played in the Sydney Olympics, scoring 5.5 points/Game and shooting .385 (15–39) from the field.[10]\n\n\nHardaway was a player/head coach of the Florida Pit Bulls of the ABA in 2006.[11][12]\n\n\nIn September 2009, he played for the NBA Generations team in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge, a series of exhibitions against Korean Basketball League and Philippine Basketball Association players.[13]\n\n\n\n## Homophobia controversy[edit]\n\n\nDuring a February 14, 2007, interview on Miami's *The Dan Le Batard Show*, in response to the coming out of former NBA player John Amaechi, Hardaway remarked that he would try to distance himself from a player he knew was homosexual. When asked by the radio show host whether he realized that his remarks were homophobic, Hardaway responded by saying: \"Well, you know I hate gay people, so I let it be known. I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States.\" He also said that if he found out he had one or more gay teammates, he would try to get them fired.[14][15]\n\n\nLater in the day, Hardaway apologized for the remarks during a telephone interview with Fox affiliate WSVN in Miami. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said I hate gay people or anything like that.\"[16] He further apologized on February 15 in a statement released by his agent.[17]\n\n\nOn the same day, the NBA responded to Hardaway's comments by removing him from its All-Star Weekend activities later that week.[17] His employer, Trinity Sports, owner of the Anderson-based CBA Indiana Alley Cats, dismissed him from his position as Chief Basketball Operations Advisor,[18] and the CBA issued a statement distancing itself from Hardaway's remarks.[19]\n\n\nIn a September 2007 interview, Hardaway spoke about his February comments, saying he \"had no idea how much I hurt people. A lot of people.\" He described the controversy as \"the biggest bump [in the road] in my life\", and added, \"I'm going to do whatever I can to correct it. That's all I can do.\"[20]\n\n\nIn an interview on February 11, 2010, on Hardcore Sports Radio on Sirius, Hardaway spoke about his recent work with The Trevor Project and The YES Institute, which he has done to educate himself on LGBT issues.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2013, when Jason Collins came out as the first active openly gay male player in a major American professional team sport, Collins said that Hardaway called him in support of his homosexuality.[21] In July 2013, Hardaway was the symbolic first signer of a petition to put a proposed amendment to the Florida State Constitution overturning Florida Amendment 2 and allowing same-sex marriage in his home state of Florida on the ballot in 2014.[22]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway and his wife Yolanda reside in Michigan. They have a son, Tim Jr., and daughters, Nia and Nina.[5][23] Tim Jr. was drafted by the New York Knicks in 2013, and currently plays for the Dallas Mavericks.[24]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989–90 | Golden State | 79 | 78 | 33.7 | .471 | .274 | .764 | 3.9 | 8.7 | 2.1 | **.2** | 14.7\n |\n| 1990–91 | Golden State | **82** | **82** | 39.2 | **.476** | **.385** | .803 | **4.0** | 9.7 | **2.6** | .1 | 22.9\n |\n| 1991–92 | Golden State | 81 | 81 | **41.1** | .461 | .338 | .766 | 3.8 | 10.0 | 2.0 | **.2** | **23.4** |\n| 1992–93 | Golden State | 66 | 66 | 39.5 | .447 | .330 | .744 | **4.0** | **10.6** | 1.8 | .**2** | 21.5\n |\n| 1994–95 | Golden State | 62 | 62 | 37.4 | .427 | .378 | .760 | 3.1 | 9.3 | 1.4 | **.2** | 20.1\n |\n| 1995–96 | Golden State | 52 | 18 | 28.6 | .421 | .366 | .769 | 2.5 | 6.9 | 1.4 | **.2** | 14.1\n |\n| 1995–96 | Miami | 28 | 28 | 37.4 | .425 | .361 | .821 | 3.5 | 10.0 | 1.0 | **.2** | 17.2\n |\n| 1996–97 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 38.7 | .415 | .344 | .799 | 3.4 | 8.6 | 1.9 | .1 | 20.3\n |\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 37.4 | .431 | .351 | .781 | 3.7 | 8.3 | 1.7 | **.2** | 18.9\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 48 | 48 | 36.9 | .400 | .360 | .812 | 3.2 | 7.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 17.4\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | 52 | 52 | 32.2 | .386 | .367 | .827 | 2.9 | 7.4 | .9 | .1 | 13.4\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 77 | 77 | 33.9 | .392 | .366 | .801 | 2.6 | 6.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 14.9\n |\n| 2001–02 | Dallas | 54 | 2 | 23.6 | .362 | .341 | **.833** | 1.8 | 3.7 | .4 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Denver | 14 | 14 | 23.2 | .373 | .373 | .632 | 1.9 | 5.5 | 1.2 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2002–03 | Indiana | 10 | 0 | 12.7 | .367 | .355 | .500 | 1.5 | 2.4 | .9 | .0 | 4.9\n |\n| Career\n | 867 | 770 | 35.3 | .431 | .355 | .782 | 3.3 | 8.2 | 1.6 | .1 | 17.7\n |\n| All-Star\n | 5 | 0 | 16.8 | .386 | .381 | .786 | 2.6 | 4.6 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 10.6\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1991 | Golden State | 9 | 9 | 44.0 | **.486** | .354 | .789 | 3.7 | **11.2** | 3.1 | **.8** | 25.2\n |\n| 1992 | Golden State | 4 | 4 | 44.0 | .400 | .345 | .649 | 3.8 | 7.3 | **3.3** | .0 | 24.5\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 36.7 | .465 | .364 | .714 | 1.7 | 5.7 | 1.0 | .0 | 17.7\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | **17** | **17** | 41.2 | .359 | .313 | **.795** | **4.1** | 7.0 | 1.6 | .1 | 18.7\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 5 | 5 | **44.4** | .447 | **.436** | .784 | 3.4 | 6.6 | 1.2 | .0 | **26.0** |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 36.4 | .268 | .200 | .625 | 2.8 | 6.4 | 1.0 | .2 | 9.0\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 7 | 7 | 26.0 | .294 | .206 | .700 | 2.1 | 4.7 | .7 | .0 | 7.7\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 2 | 2 | 18.0 | .222 | .333 | .000 | 1.0 | 4.5 | .0 | .0 | 2.5\n |\n| 2003 | Indiana | 4 | 0 | 11.8 | .333 | .300 | .000 | .5 | 2.3 | .3 | .0 | 3.3\n |\n| Career\n | 56 | 52 | 36.6 | .393 | .320 | .751 | 3.1 | 6.8 | 1.6 | .2 | 16.8\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Tim Hardaway Stats\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

His profile on the official National Basketball Association (NBA) website states that \"by acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\"[10] He played fifteen seasons in the NBA, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing the sport of basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,[11] becoming a global cultural icon.[12]\n\n\nJordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick[5][13] and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players.[14] His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"**Air Jordan**\" and \"**His Airness**\".[5][13] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][13] During his professional career, he was also selected to play for the United States national team, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.[15]\n\n\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[13] He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game).[16] In 1999, he was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century.[5] Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career,[17] and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\").[18] He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009,[19] a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010,[20] and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a \"Dream Team\" member in 2017.[21][22] In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[23]\n\n\nOne of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements.[11][24] He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular.[25] He starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film *Space Jam* (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series *The Last Dance* (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. He is also the owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. In 2016, he became the first billionaire player in NBA history.[26] That year, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] As of 2023, his net worth is estimated at $3 billion by *Forbes*.[28]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMichael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in the Fort Greene neighborhood of New York City's Brooklyn borough on February 17, 1963,[29] to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.[29][30] He has two older brothers, James R. Jordan Jr. and fellow basketball player Larry Jordan, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn.[31][32] James Jr. became command sergeant major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the U.S. Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and retired in 2006.[33] In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina.[34] He attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.[35][36]\n\n\nMotivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.[35] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[36] Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, he averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.[37] As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points,[38][39] after averaging 27 ppg,[37] 12 rebounds (rpg),[40][41] and six assists per game (apg) for the season.[41][42][43] He was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[44] In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in cultural geography.[45]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nJordan going in for a slam dunk for the Laney High School varsity basketball team, 1979–80\n![](image)\nJordan in action for North Carolina in 1983\n\nAs a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[46] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[48][49] During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.[13]\n\n\nJordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons.[50][51] After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986,[52] when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.[53] In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[54]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early NBA years (1984–1987)[edit]\n\n\nThe Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.[55] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[56] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.[57]\n\n\nJordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub.[58] During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting,[46] and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.[59][60][61] Roy S. Johnson of *The New York Times* described him as \"the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls\" in November,[61] and Jordan appeared on the cover of *Sports Illustrated* with the heading \"A Star Is Born\" in December.[62][63] The fans also voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.[5] Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[5] This led to a so-called \"freeze-out\" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him.[5] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.[64] The Bulls finished the season 38–44,[65] and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[64]\n\n\nAn often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985,[37][66] when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk.[67][68] The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordan's rise.[68][69] The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers.[70][71] Jordan's 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.[72] The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record,[65] at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.[73] Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA Champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor’s single-game playoff scoring record.[74] A Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history swept the series in three games.[64][74][75]\n\n\nJordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season,[76] and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting.[46][77] In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.[78] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[79] The Bulls reached 40 wins,[65] and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Pistons roadblock (1987–1990)[edit]\n\n\nJordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,[46] and he won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, as he averaged 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg),[80] and led the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league.[81] The Bulls finished 50–32,[65] and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[82] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons,[64] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\".[83]\n\n\nIn the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 apg.[46] During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago's point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games, with averages of 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.[84]\n\n\nThe Bulls finished with a 47–35 record,[65] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way.[85] The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit \"The Shot\" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.[86] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,[64] by utilizing their \"Jordan Rules\" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[5]\n\n\nThe Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson.[87] On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers.[88] He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg,[46] in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.[65] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers;[89] despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[64]\n\n\n\n#### First three-peat (1991–1993)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan being defended by Mookie Blaylock (number 10) during a Bulls–Nets game in 1991\nIn the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.[46] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.[65] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them;[90] this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.[91]\n\n\nThe Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way.[90] Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket.[92] In his first Finals appearance, Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg.[93] Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award,[94] and he cried while holding the Finals trophy.[95]\n\n\nJordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from the 1990–91 campaign.[65] Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg, 6.4 rbg, and 6.1 apg on 52% shooting.[80] After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \"Air\" Jordan and Clyde \"The Glide\" during the pre-Finals hype.[96]\n\n\nIn the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.[97] After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: \"I can't believe I'm doing this.\"[98] The Bulls went on to win Game 1 and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row,[94] and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor.[99]\n\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting,[80][100] Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley,[79] which upset him.[101] Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,[102] and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.[94] He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games.[103] With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.[104]\n\n\n\n#### Gambling[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bulls' 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.[105] The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,[106] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course.[107] David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling,[108][109] but the rumor spread widely.[110]\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of *60 Minutes* and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: \n\n\n> Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.\n> \n> \n\n When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: \"No.\"[111] In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of *Jordan Rides the Bus*, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research \"convinced [him it] was nonsense\".[110]\n\n\n#### First retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1995)[edit]\n\n\nBaseball player\n\n\n\n| Michael Jordan |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Jordan in training with the Scottsdale Scorpions in 1994\n |\n| Birmingham Barons – No. 45, 35 |\n| **Outfielder** |\n| **Batted:** Right\n**Threw:** Right\n |\n| Professional debut |\n| **Southern League:** April 8, 1994, for the Birmingham Barons |\n| **Arizona Fall League:** 1994, for the Scottsdale Scorpions |\n| Last Southern League appearance |\n| March 10, 1995, for the Birmingham Barons |\n| Southern League statistics (through 1994) |\n| Batting average | .202 |\n| Home runs | 3 |\n| Runs batted in | 51 |\n| Arizona Fall League statistics |\n| Batting average | .252 |\n| Runs batted in | 8 |\n|  |\n| Teams |\n| * Birmingham Barons (1994–1995)\n* Scottsdale Scorpions (1994)\n |\n\n\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. Jordan later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision.[112] James R. Jordan Sr. was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus.[113][114] His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3.[114] Green and Demery were found after they made calls on James Jordan's cell phone,[115] convicted, and sentenced to life in prison.[116]\n\n\nJordan was close to his father; as a child, he imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket.[5] In 1996, he founded a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.[117][118] In his 1998 autobiography *For the Love of the Game*, Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.[119] The added exhaustion due to the \"Dream Team\" run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.[120]\n\n\nJordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[121] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31, 1994.[122] Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player.[123] The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.[124]\n\n\nIn 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 bases on balls, and 11 errors.[125][126] His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead. His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady.[127] He also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.[122] On November 1, 1994, his No. 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as *The Spirit* outside the new United Center.[128][129][130]\n\n\n\n#### Return to the NBA (1995)[edit]\n\n\nThe Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup[65] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs.[131] The 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March;[132] the team received help when Jordan decided to return to the Bulls.[133]\n\n\nIn March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike.[134] On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA in a two-word press release: \"I'm back.\"[135] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[136] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975.[137] Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No. 45, his baseball number.[136]\n\n\nDespite his eighteen-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.[64] Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic.[138] At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan \"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\",[139] and said that \"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to\".[140]\n\n\nJordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No. 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.[140] Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black.[141] He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs, but Orlando won the series in six games.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Second three-peat (1996–1998)[edit]\n\n\nJordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season.[143] The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3.[144] The Bulls eventually finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors.[145] Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg,[146] and he won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.[13]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship.[144] Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards;[94] he also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 1969–70 season.[64] Upon winning the championship, his first since his father's murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor.[5][95]\n\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, the Bulls stood at a 69–11 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season.[147] The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz.[148] That team included Karl Malone, who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957).[149][150][151] The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as \"The Flu Game\", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining.[148] The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games.[147] For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award.[94] During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, Jordan posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort, but the MVP award went to Glen Rice.[152]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan with coach Phil Jackson in 1997\nJordan and the Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the 1997–98 season.[65] Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg,[80] securing his fifth regular season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP.[13] The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks.[153][154] After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.[155]\n\n\nThe Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history.[156] With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting Utah's lead to 86–85.[156] The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands.[156]\n\n\nJordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul.[157][158][159][160] With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career,[161] a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead. Afterwards, the Jazz' John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship,[162] achieving a second three-peat in the decade.[163] Once again, Jordan was voted Finals MVP for a record sixth time,[94] having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg, including 45 in the deciding Game 6.[164] The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history,[165] and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.[166]\n\n\n\n#### Second retirement (1999–2001)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque at the United Center that chronicles Jordan's career achievements\nWith Phil Jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.[167][168][169] On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.[170] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.[171][172] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland)[173][174] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.[171][175]\n\n\nDespite his January 1999 claim that he was \"99.9% certain\" he would never play another NBA game,[95] Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team.[176][177] Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter,[178] Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.[179] Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.[176][177]\n\n\n\n### Washington Wizards (2001–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks.[180][181] In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg),[5] and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention;[182][183] he would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot.[184] After suffering torn cartilage in his right knee,[185] and subsequent knee soreness,[186] the Wizards missed the playoffs,[187] and Jordan's season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season.[46] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.[188] The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan as a member of the Washington Wizards, April 14, 2003\nPlaying in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.[189][190] That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them, and coming from off the bench in 15. He averaged 20.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 spg per game.[5] He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free-throw line.[46] Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times.[64] On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game.[191] During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road.[192] Jordan's final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.[193][194] At several points, he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of Kwame Brown, the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft.[193][194]\n\n\n\n#### Final retirement (2003)[edit]\n\n\nWith the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation.[195] The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.[196] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both;[197] in the end, he accepted the spot of Vince Carter.[198] Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia. After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \"We want Mike!\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.[199]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan on the \"Dream Team\" in 1992\nJordan made his debut for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal.[200][201] A year later, he won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.[202]\n\n\nIn 1992, Jordan was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the \"Dream Team\", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team went on to win two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas,[203] and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics. He was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics, averaged 14.9 ppg, and finished second on the team in scoring.[204] Jordan was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, winning all 30 games he took part in.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan dunking the ball, 1987–88\nJordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards,[13] and as a point guard.[84] Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.[205] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic.[206][207][208] Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as \"a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot\".[3] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization at game time.[209]\n\n\nNoted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee.[13][210] Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times.[13] Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.[211][212] Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special \"Love of the Game Clause\" written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.[213]\n\n\nJordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate. His 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history.[214] As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable.[215] Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career, Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg.[46] For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rpg. Defensively, he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg.[46]\n\n\nThree-point field goal was not Jordan's strength, especially in his early years. Later on in Jordan's career, he improved his three-point shooting, and finished his career with a respectable 32% success rate.[46] His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989–90 and 1996–97.[13] Jordan's effective field goal percentage was 50%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which consecutively (1988–1992); he also shot 51% and 50%, and 30% and 33% from the three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Chicago Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting.[13]\n\n\nUnlike NBA players often compared to Jordan, such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, who had a similar three-point percentage, he did not shoot as many threes as they did, as he did not need to rely on the three-pointer in order to be effective on offense. Three-point shooting was only introduced in 1979 and would not be a more fundamental aspect of the game until the first decades of the 21st century,[216] with the NBA having to briefly shorten the line to incentivize more shots.[217] Jordan's three-point shooting was better selected, resulting in three-point field goals made in important games during the playoffs and the Finals, such as hitting six consecutive three-point shots in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals. Jordan shot 37%, 35%, 42%, and 37% in all the seasons he shot over 200 three-pointers, and also shot 38.5%, 38.6%, 38.9%, 40.3%, 19.4%, and 30.2% in the playoffs during his championship runs, improving his shooting even after the three-point line reverted to the original line.[218][219][220]\n\n\nIn 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards, becoming the first NBA player to win both awards in a career let alone season. In addition, he set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard,[221] and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. He ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul.[222] Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.[223] Doc Rivers declared Jordan \"the best superstar defender in the history of the game\".[224]\n\n\nJordan was known to have strong eyesight. Broadcaster Al Michaels said that he was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away.[225] During the 2001 NBA Finals, Phil Jackson compared Jordan's dominance to Shaquille O'Neal, stating: \"Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion.\"[226]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Michael Jordan](image) | This article is part of a series aboutMichael Jordan |\n\n |\n| Career\n* Career achievements\n* The Shot\n* Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals\n* 1982 NCAA Championship Game\n* Air Jordan (Jumpman)\n* Jordan Rules\n |\n| Family\n* James R.

In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time.[230] Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders.[231] He scored 32,292 points in the regular season,[232] placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Bryant.[232]\n\n\nWith five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player in NBA history.[13][233] Jordan finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times.[13] He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[234] and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[23] Jordan is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[235] Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger,[236] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[237] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.[238]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Magic Johnson[5]\n\nMany of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.[223] In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century.[239] Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.[240] In addition, the Associated Press voted him the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.[241] Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of *Sports Illustrated* a record 50 times.[242] In the September 1996 issue of *Sport*, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.[243]\n\n\nJordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players.[244][245] Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while they were growing up.[246][247] In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players \"the next Michael Jordan\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade.[248][249][250] Some analysts, such as The Ringer's Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan's experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NBA; for Devine, it \"inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game's stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers\", such as Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Dončić, and James.[251] Don Nelson stated: \"I would've been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie.\"[252]\n\n\nAlthough Jordan was a well-rounded player, his \"Air Jordan\" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players,[244] a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: \"I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.\"[244] During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.[253] The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title.[253] As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.[254]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 \"Dream Team\"; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordan's short career in the Minor League Baseball.[255] After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.[256] As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack. In September, he was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč.[17] Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan's former coaches, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech when he began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the \"Crying Jordan\" Internet meme.[257][258] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] In October 2021, Jordan was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[23] In September 2022, Jordan's jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history.[259] In December 2022, the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy, named in Jordan's honor, to be awarded beginning with the 2022–23 season. The \"Michael Jordan Trophy\" will replace the original trophy, named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff, with a new Podoloff Trophy set to be awarded to the team with the best overall regular season record.[260][261]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of career achievements by Michael Jordan § NBA career statistics\n\nSee also: List of

He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.[282] Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.[283][284]\n\n\n\n### Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations.[285][286] Despite Jordan's previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.[287] A decade earlier, Jordan had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.[288]\n\n\nIn February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.[289] As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval.[290] On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team.[291] It also made him the league's only African-American majority owner.[292]\n\n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, *The New York Times* wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan had told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin: \"If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team.\"[293] Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan \"a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon\" for wanting \"current players to pay for his incompetence\".[294] He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.[294]\n\n\nDuring the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record. The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.[295] Before the next season, Jordan said: \"I'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating.\"[296]\n\n\nDuring the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim, retaining the majority of the team for himself,[297] as well as the role of chairman.[298] In 2023, Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake of the team to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner of the Hornets, although he is keeping a minority stake.[299] The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately $3 billion, more than 10 times the $275 million Jordan had paid for the team.[300]\n\n\n\n### 23XI Racing[edit]\n\n\nOn September 21, 2020, Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving, beginning competition in the 2021 season.[301] On October 22, the team's name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing (pronounced twenty-three eleven) and the team's entry would bear No. 23.[302] After the team's inaugural season, it added a second car with No. 45, driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023.[303][304] Ty Gibbs, John Hunter Nemechek, and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season.[305][306][307] The team fielded a third car, No. 67, driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500.[308] 23XI Racing has won four races, two by Wallace, one by Busch, and one by Reddick.[309][310]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama at the White House\nJordan's nephew through his brother Larry, Justin Jordan, played NCAA Division I basketball for the UNC Greensboro Spartans and is a scout for the Charlotte Hornets.[311][312]\n\n\nJordan married Juanita Vanoy at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on September 2, 1989.[313][314] They had two sons, Jeffrey and Marcus, and a daughter, Jasmine.[315] The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \"mutually and amicably\".[316][317] It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $254 million in 2023), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.[318][319]\n\n\nIn 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, where he planned to build a 56,000-square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion. It was completed in 1995. He listed the mansion for sale in 2012.[320] He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island, Florida.[321]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim.[322] Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.[323][324][325] Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.[322]\n\n\nJordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011,[326] and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[327][328] It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.[329][330] On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.[331] In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.[332]\n\n\n\n## Media figure and business interests[edit]\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan in 2008\nJordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.[333] Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the \"Be Like Mike\" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.[333][334]\n\n\nNike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984.[335] One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon. In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that \"it's gotta be the shoes\".[333] The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \"shoe-jackings\", in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the \"Jordan Brand\". The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.[336][337] The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.[338][339]\n\n\nJordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992's Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.[340] The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film *Space Jam*, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball.[341] They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.[341] Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Jam\" (1992).[342]\n\n\nSince 2008, Jordan's yearly income from endorsements is estimated to be over $40 million.[343][344] In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.[345] Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US$30 million per season.[346] An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.[347]\n\n\nMost of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.[348] Jordan has described Falk as \"the best at what he does\" and that \"marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan'.\"[349]\n\n\n\n### Business ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Jordan was ranked by *Forbes* as the 20th-most-powerful celebrity in the world, with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to *Forbes*, Jordan Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike.[350] In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.[351][352] On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the *Charlotte Business Journal'*s Business Person of the Year for 2014.[353] In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.[354]\n\n\n*Forbes* designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017.[355] From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan's 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, the most of any retired athlete.[356] As of 2023[update], his net worth is estimated at $3 billion by *Forbes*,[28] making him the fifth-richest African-American, behind Robert F. Smith, David Steward, Oprah Winfrey, and Rihanna.[357]\n\n\nJordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham, North Carolina, acquired in 1990,[358] and formerly had a Lincoln–Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009.[359][360] The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie, Maryland.[359] The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan's. Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York City's Grand Central Terminal, among others;[361] that restaurant closed in 2018.[362] Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course, Grove XXIII, under construction in Hobe Sound, Florida.[363]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings.[364]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational, that raised money for various charities.[365] In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.[366] The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.[367]\n\n\nThe Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008.[365] In 2013, he granted his 200th wish for the organization.[368] As of 2019, he has raised more than $5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.[365] In 2023, Jordan donated $10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday.[369]\n\n\nIn 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities.[370] In 2017, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, by giving $7 million, the biggest donation he had made at the time.[371] In 2018, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts.[372] He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas' recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019.[373]\n\n\nOn June 5, 2020, in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating $100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to \"ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education\".[374] In February 2021, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County, North Carolina, by giving $10 million.[375][376]\n\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\nJordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film *Space Jam*. The film received mixed reviews,[377] but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales.[378]\n\n\nIn 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled *Michael Jordan to the Max*.[379] Two decades later, the same period of Jordan's life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning *The Last Dance*, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020. *The Last Dance* relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's and his teammates' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used.[380][381] He was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir \"there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private\".[382]\n\n\nJordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single \"Franchise\" at his home in Highland Park, Illinois.[383] Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries *The Captain*, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.[384]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nJordan has authored several books focusing on his life, basketball career, and world view.\n\n\n\n* *Rare Air: Michael on Michael*, with Mark Vancil and Walter Iooss (Harper San Francisco, 1993).[385][386]\n* *I Can't Accept Not Trying: Michael Jordan on the Pursuit of Excellence*, with Mark Vancil and Sandro Miller (Harper San Francisco, 1994).[387]\n* *For the Love of the Game: My Story*, with Mark Vancil (Crown Publishers, 1998).[388]\n* *Driven from Within*, with Mark Vancil (Atria Books, 2005).[389]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes\n* List of athletes who came out of retirement\n* List of NBA teams by single season win percentage\n* Michael Jordan's Restaurant\n* *Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City*\n* *Michael Jordan in Flight*\n* *NBA 2K11*\n* *NBA 2K12*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jordan's weight fluctuated from 195 to 218 lb (88 to 99 kg) during the course of his professional career;[1][2][3] his NBA listed weight was 216 lb (98 kg).[4][5][6]\n2. **^** Jordan wore a nameless No. 12 jersey in a February 14, 1990, game against the Orlando Magic because his No. 23 jersey had been stolen.[7] Jordan scored 49 points, setting a franchise record for players wearing that jersey number.[8]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Telander, Rick (February 14, 2018). \"Michael Jordan Put on a Helluva Show at '88 All-Star Weekend\". *Slam*.

But the race for the NBA's Most Valuable Player award has a late 1980s-early 1990s feel about it, with Michael Jordan competing against a point guard. ... But Jordan, who has returned from retirement to breathe life into the left-for-dead Washington Wizards, and Kidd, who has quarterbacked the Nets out of the mire of the Meadowlands swamps, are the odds-on favorites. ... Jordan's return from three years of retirement has been remarkable, with five 40-point performances already. He is also rebounding and handing out assists on par with his career averages. Most importantly, his indomitable will and thirst for winning have lifted Washington into playoff contention with more wins by Jan. 24 than they had all of last season. ... But if the Nets slip and the Wizards make the playoffs, Jordan will have earned what would be a record-tying sixth MVP.\n184. **^** \"2001–02 NBA Awards Voting\". *Basketball Reference*.

His profile on the official National Basketball Association (NBA) website states that \"by acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\"[10] He played fifteen seasons in the NBA, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing the sport of basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,[11] becoming a global cultural icon.[12]\n\n\nJordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick[5][13] and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players.[14] His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"**Air Jordan**\" and \"**His Airness**\".[5][13] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][13] During his professional career, he was also selected to play for the United States national team, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.[15]\n\n\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[13] He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game).[16] In 1999, he was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century.[5] Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career,[17] and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\").[18] He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009,[19] a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010,[20] and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a \"Dream Team\" member in 2017.[21][22] In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[23]\n\n\nOne of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements.[11][24] He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular.[25] He starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film *Space Jam* (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series *The Last Dance* (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. He is also the owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. In 2016, he became the first billionaire player in NBA history.[26] That year, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] As of 2023, his net worth is estimated at $3 billion by *Forbes*.[28]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMichael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in the Fort Greene neighborhood of New York City's Brooklyn borough on February 17, 1963,[29] to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.[29][30] He has two older brothers, James R. Jordan Jr. and fellow basketball player Larry Jordan, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn.[31][32] James Jr. became command sergeant major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the U.S. Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and retired in 2006.[33] In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina.[34] He attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.[35][36]\n\n\nMotivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.[35] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[36] Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, he averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.[37] As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points,[38][39] after averaging 27 ppg,[37] 12 rebounds (rpg),[40][41] and six assists per game (apg) for the season.[41][42][43] He was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[44] In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in cultural geography.[45]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nJordan going in for a slam dunk for the Laney High School varsity basketball team, 1979–80\n![](image)\nJordan in action for North Carolina in 1983\n\nAs a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[46] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[48][49] During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.[13]\n\n\nJordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons.[50][51] After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986,[52] when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.[53] In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[54]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early NBA years (1984–1987)[edit]\n\n\nThe Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.[55] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[56] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.[57]\n\n\nJordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub.[58] During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting,[46] and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.[59][60][61] Roy S. Johnson of *The New York Times* described him as \"the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls\" in November,[61] and Jordan appeared on the cover of *Sports Illustrated* with the heading \"A Star Is Born\" in December.[62][63] The fans also voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.[5] Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[5] This led to a so-called \"freeze-out\" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him.[5] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.[64] The Bulls finished the season 38–44,[65] and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[64]\n\n\nAn often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985,[37][66] when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk.[67][68] The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordan's rise.[68][69] The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers.[70][71] Jordan's 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.[72] The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record,[65] at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.[73] Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA Champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor’s single-game playoff scoring record.[74] A Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history swept the series in three games.[64][74][75]\n\n\nJordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season,[76] and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting.[46][77] In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.[78] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[79] The Bulls reached 40 wins,[65] and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Pistons roadblock (1987–1990)[edit]\n\n\nJordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,[46] and he won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, as he averaged 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg),[80] and led the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league.[81] The Bulls finished 50–32,[65] and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[82] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons,[64] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\".[83]\n\n\nIn the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 apg.[46] During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago's point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games, with averages of 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.[84]\n\n\nThe Bulls finished with a 47–35 record,[65] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way.[85] The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit \"The Shot\" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.[86] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,[64] by utilizing their \"Jordan Rules\" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[5]\n\n\nThe Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson.[87] On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers.[88] He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg,[46] in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.[65] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers;[89] despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[64]\n\n\n\n#### First three-peat (1991–1993)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan being defended by Mookie Blaylock (number 10) during a Bulls–Nets game in 1991\nIn the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.[46] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.[65] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them;[90] this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.[91]\n\n\nThe Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way.[90] Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket.[92] In his first Finals appearance, Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg.[93] Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award,[94] and he cried while holding the Finals trophy.[95]\n\n\nJordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from the 1990–91 campaign.[65] Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg, 6.4 rbg, and 6.1 apg on 52% shooting.[80] After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \"Air\" Jordan and Clyde \"The Glide\" during the pre-Finals hype.[96]\n\n\nIn the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.[97] After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: \"I can't believe I'm doing this.\"[98] The Bulls went on to win Game 1 and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row,[94] and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor.[99]\n\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting,[80][100] Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley,[79] which upset him.[101] Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,[102] and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.[94] He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games.[103] With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.[104]\n\n\n\n#### Gambling[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bulls' 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.[105] The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,[106] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course.[107] David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling,[108][109] but the rumor spread widely.[110]\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of *60 Minutes* and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: \n\n\n> Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.\n> \n> \n\n When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: \"No.\"[111] In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of *Jordan Rides the Bus*, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research \"convinced [him it] was nonsense\".[110]\n\n\n#### First retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1995)[edit]\n\n\nBaseball player\n\n\n\n| Michael Jordan |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Jordan in training with the Scottsdale Scorpions in 1994\n |\n| Birmingham Barons – No. 45, 35 |\n| **Outfielder** |\n| **Batted:** Right\n**Threw:** Right\n |\n| Professional debut |\n| **Southern League:** April 8, 1994, for the Birmingham Barons |\n| **Arizona Fall League:** 1994, for the Scottsdale Scorpions |\n| Last Southern League appearance |\n| March 10, 1995, for the Birmingham Barons |\n| Southern League statistics (through 1994) |\n| Batting average | .202 |\n| Home runs | 3 |\n| Runs batted in | 51 |\n| Arizona Fall League statistics |\n| Batting average | .252 |\n| Runs batted in | 8 |\n|  |\n| Teams |\n| * Birmingham Barons (1994–1995)\n* Scottsdale Scorpions (1994)\n |\n\n\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. Jordan later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision.[112] James R. Jordan Sr. was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus.[113][114] His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3.[114] Green and Demery were found after they made calls on James Jordan's cell phone,[115] convicted, and sentenced to life in prison.[116]\n\n\nJordan was close to his father; as a child, he imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket.[5] In 1996, he founded a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.[117][118] In his 1998 autobiography *For the Love of the Game*, Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.[119] The added exhaustion due to the \"Dream Team\" run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.[120]\n\n\nJordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[121] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31, 1994.[122] Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player.[123] The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.[124]\n\n\nIn 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 bases on balls, and 11 errors.[125][126] His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead. His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady.[127] He also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.[122] On November 1, 1994, his No. 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as *The Spirit* outside the new United Center.[128][129][130]\n\n\n\n#### Return to the NBA (1995)[edit]\n\n\nThe Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup[65] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs.[131] The 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March;[132] the team received help when Jordan decided to return to the Bulls.[133]\n\n\nIn March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike.[134] On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA in a two-word press release: \"I'm back.\"[135] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[136] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975.[137] Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No. 45, his baseball number.[136]\n\n\nDespite his eighteen-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.[64] Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic.[138] At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan \"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\",[139] and said that \"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to\".[140]\n\n\nJordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No. 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.[140] Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black.[141] He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs, but Orlando won the series in six games.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Second three-peat (1996–1998)[edit]\n\n\nJordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season.[143] The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3.[144] The Bulls eventually finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors.[145] Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg,[146] and he won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.[13]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship.[144] Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards;[94] he also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 1969–70 season.[64] Upon winning the championship, his first since his father's murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor.[5][95]\n\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, the Bulls stood at a 69–11 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season.[147] The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz.[148] That team included Karl Malone, who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957).[149][150][151] The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as \"The Flu Game\", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining.[148] The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games.[147] For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award.[94] During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, Jordan posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort, but the MVP award went to Glen Rice.[152]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan with coach Phil Jackson in 1997\nJordan and the Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the 1997–98 season.[65] Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg,[80] securing his fifth regular season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP.[13] The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks.[153][154] After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.[155]\n\n\nThe Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history.[156] With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting Utah's lead to 86–85.[156] The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands.[156]\n\n\nJordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul.[157][158][159][160] With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career,[161] a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead. Afterwards, the Jazz' John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship,[162] achieving a second three-peat in the decade.[163] Once again, Jordan was voted Finals MVP for a record sixth time,[94] having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg, including 45 in the deciding Game 6.[164] The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history,[165] and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.[166]\n\n\n\n#### Second retirement (1999–2001)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque at the United Center that chronicles Jordan's career achievements\nWith Phil Jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.[167][168][169] On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.[170] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.[171][172] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland)[173][174] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.[171][175]\n\n\nDespite his January 1999 claim that he was \"99.9% certain\" he would never play another NBA game,[95] Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team.[176][177] Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter,[178] Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.[179] Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.[176][177]\n\n\n\n### Washington Wizards (2001–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks.[180][181] In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg),[5] and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention;[182][183] he would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot.[184] After suffering torn cartilage in his right knee,[185] and subsequent knee soreness,[186] the Wizards missed the playoffs,[187] and Jordan's season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season.[46] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.[188] The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan as a member of the Washington Wizards, April 14, 2003\nPlaying in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.[189][190] That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them, and coming from off the bench in 15. He averaged 20.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 spg per game.[5] He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free-throw line.[46] Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times.[64] On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game.[191] During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road.[192] Jordan's final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.[193][194] At several points, he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of Kwame Brown, the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft.[193][194]\n\n\n\n#### Final retirement (2003)[edit]\n\n\nWith the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation.[195] The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.[196] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both;[197] in the end, he accepted the spot of Vince Carter.[198] Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia. After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \"We want Mike!\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.[199]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan on the \"Dream Team\" in 1992\nJordan made his debut for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal.[200][201] A year later, he won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.[202]\n\n\nIn 1992, Jordan was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the \"Dream Team\", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team went on to win two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas,[203] and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics. He was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics, averaged 14.9 ppg, and finished second on the team in scoring.[204] Jordan was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, winning all 30 games he took part in.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan dunking the ball, 1987–88\nJordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards,[13] and as a point guard.[84] Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.[205] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic.[206][207][208] Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as \"a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot\".[3] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization at game time.[209]\n\n\nNoted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee.[13][210] Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times.[13] Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.[211][212] Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special \"Love of the Game Clause\" written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.[213]\n\n\nJordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate. His 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history.[214] As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable.[215] Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career, Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg.[46] For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rpg. Defensively, he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg.[46]\n\n\nThree-point field goal was not Jordan's strength, especially in his early years. Later on in Jordan's career, he improved his three-point shooting, and finished his career with a respectable 32% success rate.[46] His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989–90 and 1996–97.[13] Jordan's effective field goal percentage was 50%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which consecutively (1988–1992); he also shot 51% and 50%, and 30% and 33% from the three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Chicago Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting.[13]\n\n\nUnlike NBA players often compared to Jordan, such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, who had a similar three-point percentage, he did not shoot as many threes as they did, as he did not need to rely on the three-pointer in order to be effective on offense. Three-point shooting was only introduced in 1979 and would not be a more fundamental aspect of the game until the first decades of the 21st century,[216] with the NBA having to briefly shorten the line to incentivize more shots.[217] Jordan's three-point shooting was better selected, resulting in three-point field goals made in important games during the playoffs and the Finals, such as hitting six consecutive three-point shots in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals. Jordan shot 37%, 35%, 42%, and 37% in all the seasons he shot over 200 three-pointers, and also shot 38.5%, 38.6%, 38.9%, 40.3%, 19.4%, and 30.2% in the playoffs during his championship runs, improving his shooting even after the three-point line reverted to the original line.[218][219][220]\n\n\nIn 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards, becoming the first NBA player to win both awards in a career let alone season. In addition, he set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard,[221] and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. He ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul.[222] Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.[223] Doc Rivers declared Jordan \"the best superstar defender in the history of the game\".[224]\n\n\nJordan was known to have strong eyesight. Broadcaster Al Michaels said that he was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away.[225] During the 2001 NBA Finals, Phil Jackson compared Jordan's dominance to Shaquille O'Neal, stating: \"Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion.\"[226]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Michael Jordan](image) | This article is part of a series aboutMichael Jordan |\n\n |\n| Career\n* Career achievements\n* The Shot\n* Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals\n* 1982 NCAA Championship Game\n* Air Jordan (Jumpman)\n* Jordan Rules\n |\n| Family\n* James R.

In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time.[230] Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders.[231] He scored 32,292 points in the regular season,[232] placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Bryant.[232]\n\n\nWith five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player in NBA history.[13][233] Jordan finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times.[13] He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[234] and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[23] Jordan is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[235] Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger,[236] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[237] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.[238]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Magic Johnson[5]\n\nMany of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.[223] In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century.[239] Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.[240] In addition, the Associated Press voted him the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.[241] Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of *Sports Illustrated* a record 50 times.[242] In the September 1996 issue of *Sport*, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.[243]\n\n\nJordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players.[244][245] Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while they were growing up.[246][247] In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players \"the next Michael Jordan\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade.[248][249][250] Some analysts, such as The Ringer's Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan's experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NBA; for Devine, it \"inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game's stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers\", such as Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Dončić, and James.[251] Don Nelson stated: \"I would've been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie.\"[252]\n\n\nAlthough Jordan was a well-rounded player, his \"Air Jordan\" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players,[244] a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: \"I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.\"[244] During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.[253] The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title.[253] As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.[254]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 \"Dream Team\"; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordan's short career in the Minor League Baseball.[255] After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.[256] As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack. In September, he was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč.[17] Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan's former coaches, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech when he began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the \"Crying Jordan\" Internet meme.[257][258] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] In October 2021, Jordan was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[23] In September 2022, Jordan's jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history.[259] In December 2022, the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy, named in Jordan's honor, to be awarded beginning with the 2022–23 season. The \"Michael Jordan Trophy\" will replace the original trophy, named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff, with a new Podoloff Trophy set to be awarded to the team with the best overall regular season record.[260][261]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of career achievements by Michael Jordan § NBA career statistics\n\nSee also: List of

He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.[282] Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.[283][284]\n\n\n\n### Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations.[285][286] Despite Jordan's previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.[287] A decade earlier, Jordan had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.[288]\n\n\nIn February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.[289] As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval.[290] On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team.[291] It also made him the league's only African-American majority owner.[292]\n\n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, *The New York Times* wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan had told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin: \"If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team.\"[293] Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan \"a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon\" for wanting \"current players to pay for his incompetence\".[294] He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.[294]\n\n\nDuring the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record. The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.[295] Before the next season, Jordan said: \"I'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating.\"[296]\n\n\nDuring the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim, retaining the majority of the team for himself,[297] as well as the role of chairman.[298] In 2023, Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake of the team to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner of the Hornets, although he is keeping a minority stake.[299] The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately $3 billion, more than 10 times the $275 million Jordan had paid for the team.[300]\n\n\n\n### 23XI Racing[edit]\n\n\nOn September 21, 2020, Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving, beginning competition in the 2021 season.[301] On October 22, the team's name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing (pronounced twenty-three eleven) and the team's entry would bear No. 23.[302] After the team's inaugural season, it added a second car with No. 45, driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023.[303][304] Ty Gibbs, John Hunter Nemechek, and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season.[305][306][307] The team fielded a third car, No. 67, driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500.[308] 23XI Racing has won four races, two by Wallace, one by Busch, and one by Reddick.[309][310]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama at the White House\nJordan's nephew through his brother Larry, Justin Jordan, played NCAA Division I basketball for the UNC Greensboro Spartans and is a scout for the Charlotte Hornets.[311][312]\n\n\nJordan married Juanita Vanoy at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on September 2, 1989.[313][314] They had two sons, Jeffrey and Marcus, and a daughter, Jasmine.[315] The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \"mutually and amicably\".[316][317] It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $254 million in 2023), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.[318][319]\n\n\nIn 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, where he planned to build a 56,000-square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion. It was completed in 1995. He listed the mansion for sale in 2012.[320] He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island, Florida.[321]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim.[322] Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.[323][324][325] Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.[322]\n\n\nJordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011,[326] and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[327][328] It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.[329][330] On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.[331] In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.[332]\n\n\n\n## Media figure and business interests[edit]\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan in 2008\nJordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.[333] Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the \"Be Like Mike\" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.[333][334]\n\n\nNike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984.[335] One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon. In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that \"it's gotta be the shoes\".[333] The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \"shoe-jackings\", in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the \"Jordan Brand\". The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.[336][337] The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.[338][339]\n\n\nJordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992's Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.[340] The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film *Space Jam*, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball.[341] They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.[341] Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Jam\" (1992).[342]\n\n\nSince 2008, Jordan's yearly income from endorsements is estimated to be over $40 million.[343][344] In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.[345] Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US$30 million per season.[346] An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.[347]\n\n\nMost of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.[348] Jordan has described Falk as \"the best at what he does\" and that \"marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan'.\"[349]\n\n\n\n### Business ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Jordan was ranked by *Forbes* as the 20th-most-powerful celebrity in the world, with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to *Forbes*, Jordan Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike.[350] In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.[351][352] On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the *Charlotte Business Journal'*s Business Person of the Year for 2014.[353] In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.[354]\n\n\n*Forbes* designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017.[355] From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan's 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, the most of any retired athlete.[356] As of 2023[update], his net worth is estimated at $3 billion by *Forbes*,[28] making him the fifth-richest African-American, behind Robert F. Smith, David Steward, Oprah Winfrey, and Rihanna.[357]\n\n\nJordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham, North Carolina, acquired in 1990,[358] and formerly had a Lincoln–Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009.[359][360] The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie, Maryland.[359] The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan's. Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York City's Grand Central Terminal, among others;[361] that restaurant closed in 2018.[362] Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course, Grove XXIII, under construction in Hobe Sound, Florida.[363]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings.[364]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational, that raised money for various charities.[365] In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.[366] The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.[367]\n\n\nThe Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008.[365] In 2013, he granted his 200th wish for the organization.[368] As of 2019, he has raised more than $5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.[365] In 2023, Jordan donated $10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday.[369]\n\n\nIn 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities.[370] In 2017, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, by giving $7 million, the biggest donation he had made at the time.[371] In 2018, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts.[372] He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas' recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019.[373]\n\n\nOn June 5, 2020, in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating $100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to \"ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education\".[374] In February 2021, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County, North Carolina, by giving $10 million.[375][376]\n\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\nJordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film *Space Jam*. The film received mixed reviews,[377] but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales.[378]\n\n\nIn 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled *Michael Jordan to the Max*.[379] Two decades later, the same period of Jordan's life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning *The Last Dance*, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020. *The Last Dance* relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's and his teammates' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used.[380][381] He was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir \"there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private\".[382]\n\n\nJordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single \"Franchise\" at his home in Highland Park, Illinois.[383] Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries *The Captain*, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.[384]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nJordan has authored several books focusing on his life, basketball career, and world view.\n\n\n\n* *Rare Air: Michael on Michael*, with Mark Vancil and Walter Iooss (Harper San Francisco, 1993).[385][386]\n* *I Can't Accept Not Trying: Michael Jordan on the Pursuit of Excellence*, with Mark Vancil and Sandro Miller (Harper San Francisco, 1994).[387]\n* *For the Love of the Game: My Story*, with Mark Vancil (Crown Publishers, 1998).[388]\n* *Driven from Within*, with Mark Vancil (Atria Books, 2005).[389]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes\n* List of athletes who came out of retirement\n* List of NBA teams by single season win percentage\n* Michael Jordan's Restaurant\n* *Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City*\n* *Michael Jordan in Flight*\n* *NBA 2K11*\n* *NBA 2K12*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jordan's weight fluctuated from 195 to 218 lb (88 to 99 kg) during the course of his professional career;[1][2][3] his NBA listed weight was 216 lb (98 kg).[4][5][6]\n2. **^** Jordan wore a nameless No. 12 jersey in a February 14, 1990, game against the Orlando Magic because his No. 23 jersey had been stolen.[7] Jordan scored 49 points, setting a franchise record for players wearing that jersey number.[8]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Telander, Rick (February 14, 2018). \"Michael Jordan Put on a Helluva Show at '88 All-Star Weekend\". *Slam*.

But Jordan, who has returned from retirement to breathe life into the left-for-dead Washington Wizards, and Kidd, who has quarterbacked the Nets out of the mire of the Meadowlands swamps, are the odds-on favorites. ... Jordan's return from three years of retirement has been remarkable, with five 40-point performances already. He is also rebounding and handing out assists on par with his career averages. Most importantly, his indomitable will and thirst for winning have lifted Washington into playoff contention with more wins by Jan. 24 than they had all of last season. ...

He is a 7-foot-1-inch (2.16 m) and 325-pound (147 kg) center who played for six teams over his 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is a four-time NBA champion. O'Neal is regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nAfter playing college basketball for the LSU Tigers, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid a feud between O'Neal and his teammate Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.[6] O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.[7]\n\n\nO'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award; the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award; 15 All-Star Game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards; three Finals MVP awards; two scoring titles; 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 8th all-time in points scored, 6th in field goals, 15th in rebounds, and 8th in blocks. O'Neal was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996.[8] Due to his ability to dunk the basketball and score from close range, O'Neal also ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%) and led the league in field goal percentage ten times.[9] O'Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.[10] He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017.[11] In October 2021, O'Neal was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[12]\n\n\nIn addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, *Shaq Diesel*, going platinum. O'Neal is also an electronic music producer, and touring DJ, known as DIESEL.[13] He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, *Shaq's Big Challenge* and *Shaq Vs.* He hosts *The Big Podcast with Shaq*.[14] He was a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings from 2013 to 2022 and is the general manager of Kings Guard Gaming of the NBA 2K League.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal playing for the Cole High School varsity basketball team in 1988–89\nO'Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey,[16] to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school basketball (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall. Toney struggled with drug addiction and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's Jamaican stepfather, Phillip Arthur Harrison, a career Army sergeant.[17][18] O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship.[18] On his 1994 rap album, *Shaq Fu: The Return*, O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song \"Biological Didn't Bother\", dismissing him with the line \"Phil is my father.\" However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O'Neal telling him, \"I don't hate you. I had a good life. I had Phil.\"[19]\n\n\nO'Neal came from a tall family. His father and mother were 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall, respectively, and by age 13, O'Neal was already 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall. He credited the Boys & Girls Clubs of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. \"It gave me something to do,\" he said. \"I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team.\"[20] Because of his stepfather's career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to military bases in Germany and Texas.[21]\n\n\nAfter returning from Germany, O'Neal's family settled in San Antonio, Texas. By age 16, O'Neal had grown to 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), and he began playing basketball at Robert G. Cole High School. He led his team to a 68–1 record over two years and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year.[22] His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification.[23] O'Neal's tendency to make hook shots earned comparisons to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, inspiring him to wear the same jersey number as Abdul-Jabbar, No. 33. However, his high school team did not have a *33* jersey, so O'Neal chose to wear No. 32 before college.[24]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school, O'Neal studied business at Louisiana State University (LSU). He had first met Tigers coach Dale Brown years earlier in Europe when O'Neal's stepfather was stationed on a U.S. Army base at Wildflecken, West Germany. While playing for Brown at LSU, O'Neal was a two-time All-American, two-time SEC Player of the Year, and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991; he was also named college player of the year by AP and UPI. O'Neal left LSU early to pursue his NBA career, but continued his education even after becoming a professional player.[25] He was later inducted into the LSU Hall of Fame.[26] A 900-pound (410 kg) bronze statue of O'Neal is located in front of the LSU Basketball Practice Facility.[27]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (1992–1996)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (1992–1993)[edit]\n\n\nThe Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. In the summer before moving to Orlando, he spent time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson.[28] O'Neal wore number 32 because Terry Catledge refused to relinquish the 33 jersey.[24] O'Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA, the first player to do so.[29] During his rookie season, O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season. He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985.[30] The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season, but missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers. On more than one occasion during the year, *Sports Illustrated* writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying, \"We've got to get [head coach] Matty [Guokas] out of here and bring in [assistant] Brian [Hill].\"[31]\n\n\n\n#### First playoff appearance (1993–1994)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993–1994, O'Neal's second season, Hill was the coach and Guokas was reassigned to the front office.[32] O'Neal improved his scoring average to 29.4 points (second in the league to David Robinson) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at 60%. On November 20, 1993, against the New Jersey Nets, O'Neal registered the first triple-double of his career, recording 24 points to go along with career highs of 28 rebounds and 15 blocks.[33] He was voted into the All-Star game and also made the All-NBA 3rd Team. Teamed with newly drafted Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway, the Magic finished with a record of 50–32 and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.[34] In his first playoff series, O'Neal averaged 20.7 points and 13.3 rebounds[35][*unreliable source*] as the Pacers swept the Magic.[36][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n#### First scoring title and NBA Finals (1994–1996)[edit]\n\n\nIn O'Neal's third season, 1994–95, he led the NBA in scoring with a 29.3 point average, while finishing second in MVP voting to David Robinson and entering his third straight All-Star Game along with Hardaway. They formed one of the league's top duos and helped Orlando to a 57–25 record and the Atlantic Division crown. The Magic won their first-ever playoff series against the Boston Celtics in the 1995 NBA Playoffs. They then defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinals. After beating Reggie Miller's Indiana Pacers, the Magic reached the NBA Finals, facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. O'Neal played well in his first Finals appearance, averaging 28 points on 59.5% shooting, 12.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists. Despite this, the Rockets, led by future Hall-of-Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, swept the series in four games.[37]\n\n\nO'Neal was injured for a great deal of the 1995–96 season, missing 28 games. He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game, made the All-NBA 3rd Team, and played in his 4th All-Star Game. Despite O'Neal's injuries, the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60–22, second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls, who finished with an NBA record 72 wins. Orlando easily defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the 1996 NBA Playoffs; however, they were no match for Jordan's Bulls, who swept them in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004)[edit]\n\n\n#### O'Neal–Bryant tandem buildup (1996–1999)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 8 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004), O'Neal won three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 and appeared in the 2004 NBA Finals.\nO'Neal became a free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the *Orlando Sentinel* published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning.[38][39] 82% answered \"no\".[38] O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill.[40][41] He said the team \"just didn't respect [Hill]\".[42] Another question in the poll asked whether O'Neal was worth $115 million, in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer; 91.3% of the response said it was not.[39][40] O'Neal's Olympic teammates teased him over the poll.[39][41] He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry.[38] O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to \"feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond\".[43] He also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him.[44]\n\n\nOn the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, the media announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121 million contract.[45][46] O'Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\"[47][48] The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season.[49] O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games.[50] In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The *Los Angeles Daily News* reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: \"It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.\"[51]\n\n\nThe following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61–21, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4–0 sweep.[52]\n\n\nWith the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar Kobe Bryant, expectations for the Lakers increased; however, personnel changes were a source of instability during the 1998–99 season. Long-time Laker point guard Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets; his former backcourt partner Eddie Jones was packaged with back-up center Elden Campbell for Glen Rice to satisfy a demand by O'Neal for a shooter. Coach Del Harris was fired, and former Lakers forward Kurt Rambis finished the season as head coach. The Lakers finished with a 31–19 record during the lockout-shortened season. Although they made the playoffs, they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs. The Spurs would go on to win their first NBA title in 1999.\n\n\n\n#### MVP and championship seasons (1999–2002)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal during Game 5 of the 2000 NBA Finals\nIn 1999, prior to the 1999–2000 season, the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach, and the team's fortunes soon changed. Jackson immediately challenged O'Neal, telling him \"the [NBA's] MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired.\"[53]\n\n\nIn the November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.[54] On March 6, 2000, O'Neal's 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123–103 win over the LA Clippers.[55] O'Neal's 61-point game is the most recent game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer.[56]\n\n\nO'Neal was also voted the 1999–2000 regular season Most Valuable Player, one vote short of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Fred Hickman, then of CNN, instead chose Allen Iverson, then of the Philadelphia 76ers who would go on to win MVP the next season. O'Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots. Jackson's influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O'Neal to defense, resulting in his first All-Defensive Team selection (second-team) in 2000.[57]\n\n\nIn the 2001 NBA Finals against the 76ers, O'Neal fouled out in Game 3 backing over Dikembe Mutombo, the 2000–2001 Defensive Player of the Year. \"I didn't think the best defensive player in the game would be flopping like that. It's a shame that the referees buy into that\", O'Neal said. \"I wish he'd stand up and play me like a man instead of flopping and crying every time I back him down.[58]\n\n\nA month before the 2001–02 season's training camp, O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot.[59] He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker.[60] He was ready for the start of the 2001–02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him.[59]\n\n\nIn January 2002, he was involved in a spectacular on-court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls. He punched center Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket, resulting in a melee with Miller, forward Charles Oakley, and several other players.[61] O'Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000.[62] For the season, O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, excellent statistics but below his career average; he was less of a defensive force during the season.[59]\n\n\nMatched up against the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 Western Conference finals, O'Neal said, \"There is only one way to beat us. It starts with c and ends with t.\" O'Neal meant \"cheat\" in reference to the alleged flopping of Kings' center Vlade Divac. O'Neal referred to Divac as \"she\", and said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul. \"I'm a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work.\"[63] \nAfter the 2001–2002 season, O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.[59]\n\n\nUsing Jackson's triangle offense, O'Neal and Bryant enjoyed tremendous success, leading the Lakers to three consecutive titles (2000, 2001, and 2002). O'Neal was named MVP of the NBA Finals all three times and had the highest scoring average for a center in NBA Finals history.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Toe surgery to departure (2002–2004)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal missed the first 12 games of the 2002–03 season recovering from toe surgery.[65] He was sidelined with hallux rigidus, a degenerative arthritis in his toe.[66] He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained, \"I got hurt on company time, so I'll heal on company time.\"[67] O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure.[66] The Lakers started the season with a record of 11–19.[68] At the end of the season, the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003.\n\n\nFor the 2003–04 season, the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of two aging stars—forward Karl Malone and guard Gary Payton—but due to salary cap restrictions, could not offer either player nearly as much money as he could have made with some other teams. O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season, O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. During a preseason game, O'Neal had yelled at Lakers owner Jerry Buss, \"Pay me.\"[69] There had been increasing tension between O'Neal and Bryant. The feud climaxed during training camp prior to the 2003–2004 season when Bryant, in an interview with ESPN journalist Jim Gray, criticized O'Neal for being out of shape, a poor leader, and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the team.[70]\n\n\nThe Lakers made the playoffs in 2004 and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter said, \"Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He's always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding\".[71] After the series, O'Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak regarding O'Neal's future with the club, as well as by the departure of Lakers coach Phil Jackson at the request of Buss. O'Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team's decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns, and O'Neal promptly demanded a trade. Kupchak wanted the Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki in return but Mavericks owner Mark Cuban refused to let his 7-footer go. However, Miami showed interest, and eventually the two clubs agreed on a trade.[72] Winter said, \"[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much.\"[73]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2004–2008)[edit]\n\n\n#### MVP runner-up (2004–2005)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Miami in 2007\nOn July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, and a future first-round draft choice (the Lakers used the draft choice to select Jordan Farmar in the 2006 draft). O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star Dwyane Wade, to whom he gave the nickname \"Flash\". With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. O'Neal made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference Player of the Month award for his performance in March. O'Neal also narrowly lost the 2004–05 MVP Award to Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash in one of the closest votes in NBA history.[74]\n\n\nDespite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference Finals and a Game 7 against the defending champion Detroit Pistons, losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O'Neal.[75] \nIn August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100 million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20 million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth championship (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\nIn the second game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities.[67] O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a \"frontrunner\" and a \"master of panic.\"[77] Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview \"Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game.\"[78] During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a .500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.[79]\n\n\n\nOn April 11, 2006, O'Neal recorded his second career triple-double against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists.[80] O'Neal finished the 2005–06 season as the league leader in field goal percentage.[80]\n\n![](image)O'Neal holding the championship ball when the NBA Champion Heat visited the White House\nIn the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2–0 lead in the series. Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3–1 series lead. The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat \nheld on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first-ever NBA Finals.[81]\n\n\nIn the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks led by Dirk Nowitzki, and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion. The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title. With Wade carrying the offensive load, O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Surgery and Wade's injury (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, O'Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery.[82][83] After one of those missed games, a Christmas Day match-up against the Lakers, he ripped Jackson, who O'Neal had once called a second father, referring to his former coach as \"Benedict Arnold\". Jackson had previously said, \"The only person I've ever [coached] that hasn't been a worker... is probably Shaq.\"[84] The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence,[85] but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team.[85] Critics doubted that O'Neal, now in his mid-30s, could carry the team into the playoffs.[86] The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.[85]\n\n\nIn a rematch of the year before, the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006–07 NBA playoffs. The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round.[87] It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006–07 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Career lows and disagreements (2007–2008)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007–08 season, averaging career lows in points, rebounds, and blocks. His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O'Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season.[9] O'Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15–game losing streak.[88] According to O'Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury.[89] During a practice in February 2008, O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal.[90] O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not \"all that good\" by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.[91]\n\n\nO'Neal played 33 games for the Miami Heat in the 2007–08 season prior to being traded to the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal started all 33 games and averaged 14.2 points per game. Following the trade to Phoenix, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points while starting all 28 games with the Suns.\n\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns (2008–2009)[edit]\n\n\nThe Phoenix Suns acquired O'Neal in February 2008 from the league-worst Miami Heat, who had a record at the time of the trade of 9–37, in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[92] O'Neal made his Suns debut on February 20, 2008, against his former Lakers team, scoring 15 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in the process. The Lakers won, 130–124. O'Neal was upbeat in a post-game press conference, stating: \"I will take the blame for this loss because I wasn't in tune with the guys [...] But give me four or five days to really get in tune and I'll get it.\"[93]\n\n\nIn 28 regular season games, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points and 10.6 rebounds,[94] good enough to make the playoffs. One of the reasons for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, especially after the Suns' six-game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs.[95] O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, but they were once again eliminated, in five games. O'Neal averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.[94]\n\n\nO'Neal preferred his new situation with the Suns over the Heat. \"I love playing for this coach and I love playing with these guys\", O'Neal said. \"We have professionals who know what to do. No one is asking me to play with [his former Heat teammates] Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis. I'm actually on a team again.\" Riley felt O'Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates. O'Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley, whom he often referred to as the \"great Pat Riley\" while playing for the Heat.[96] O'Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career.[97] They connected his arthritic toe, which would not bend, to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg. The trainers had him concentrate on building his core strength, flexibility, and balance.[98]\n\n\nThe 2008–09 season improved for O'Neal, who averaged 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks through the first half (41 games) of the season, leading the Suns to a 23–18 record and 2nd place in their division.[99] He returned to the All-Star Game in 2009 and emerged as co-MVP along with ex-teammate Kobe Bryant.\n\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Phoenix teammate Steve Nash\nOn February 27, 2009, O'Neal scored 45 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, his 49th career 40-point game, beating the Toronto Raptors 133–113.\n\n\nIn a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. \"I'm really too old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds\", O'Neal said, referring to the then 23-year-old Howard. \"It's not really my role anymore.\" O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. \"I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool\", said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was \"very disappointed cause [O'Neal] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.\"[100] O'Neal responded, \"Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching.\"[101] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since \"everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back.\"[102] In a 2006 interview in *TIME*, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would \"Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass.\"[103]\n\n\nOn March 6, O'Neal talked about the upcoming game against the Rockets and Yao Ming. \"It's not going to be man-on-man, so don't even try that,\" says O'Neal with an incredulous laugh. \"They're going to double and triple me like everybody else ... I rarely get to play [Yao] one-on-one ... But when I play him (on defense), it's just going to be me down there. So don't try to make it a Yao versus Shaq thing, when it's Shaq versus four other guys.\"[104]\n\n\nThe 2009 NBA Playoffs was also the first time since O'Neal's rookie season in 1992–93 that he did not participate in the playoffs. He was named as a member of the All-NBA Third Team. The Suns notified O'Neal he might be traded to cut costs.[105]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, 2009, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Sasha Pavlovic, Ben Wallace, $500,000, and a 2010 second-round draft pick.[106] Upon arriving in Cleveland, O'Neal said, \"My motto is very simple: Win a Ring for the King\", referring to LeBron James.[107] James was the leader of the team, and O'Neal deferred to him.[108] On February 25, 2010, O'Neal suffered a severe right thumb injury while attempting to go up for a shot against Glen Davis of the Boston Celtics.[109] He had surgery on the thumb on March 1 and returned to play in time for the first round of the playoffs.[110] After defeating the Chicago Bulls in the first round, the Cavaliers went on to lose to the Boston Celtics in the second round. In September 2016, O'Neal said: \"When I was in Cleveland, we were in first place. Big Baby [Glen Davis] breaks my hand and I had to sit out five weeks late in the year. I come back finally in the first round of the playoffs, and we lost to Boston in the second round. I was upset. I know for a fact if I was healthy, we would have gotten it done that year and won a ring.\"[111] O'Neal averaged career lows in almost every major statistical category during the 2009–10 season, taking on a much less significant role than in previous years.\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal finished his career with the Boston Celtics.\nUpon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O'Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Celtics, saw an opportunity to acquire O'Neal.[112] Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O'Neal would not receive preferential treatment, nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami.[113] On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal.[114] The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8 million.[115] O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal.[116] The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands.[117][118] He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.[119]\n\n\nO'Neal said he did not \"compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe.\" O'Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan: \"If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that.\"[120] Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected to be part of the second unit.[120] Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself.[121] O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg[122] including knee,[123] calf,[124] hip,[125] and Achilles injuries.[126] The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,[122] and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[127] After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf.[122][128] It was the last regular season game he would play that year.[129] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.[130][131]\n\n\nOn June 1, 2011, O'Neal announced his retirement via social media.[132][133] On a short video on Twitter, O'Neal tweeted, \"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.\" On June 3, 2011, O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement.[134]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nWhile in college, O'Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner.[135] His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament. While he led the Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup.\n\n\nHe was one of two players (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.[136]\n\n\nAfter his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition. He was angered by being overlooked for the 1999 FIBA AmeriCup squad, saying it was a \"lack of respect\".[137] He forwent an opportunity to participate in the 2000 Olympics, explaining that two gold medals were enough.[138] O'Neal also chose not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[139] He rejected an offer to play in the 2004 Olympics,[140] and although he was initially interested in being named for 2006–2008 US preliminary roster,[141] he eventually declined the invitation.[142]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal's free throw shooting was regarded as one of his major weaknesses.\nO'Neal established himself as an overpowering low post presence, putting up career averages of 23.7 points on .582 field goal accuracy, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game.\n\n\nAt 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m), 330 lb (150 kg)[143] and U.S. shoe size 23,[65] he became famous for his physical stature. His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents. On two occasions during his first season in the NBA, his powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports, prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.[144]\n\n\nO'Neal's \"drop step\", (called the \"Black Tornado\" by O'Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage slam dunk, proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time.[145] He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of nine.[65]\n\n\nOpposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[146]\n\n\nO'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.[147] O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80 percent in practice.[148] In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as \"Hack-a-Shaq\". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,[149] having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.[150]\n\n\nO'Neal only made one three-point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three-point-shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).\n\n\nO'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.[151]\n\n\nPhil Jackson believed O'Neal underachieved in his career, saying he \"could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons.\"[152] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named O'Neal as the 8th greatest player in NBA history.[153]\n\n\nThe Lakers retired his No. 34 jersey on April 2, 2013.[154] On February 26, 2016, the Miami Heat announced that it would retire O'Neal's No. 32 jersey during the 2016–17 season, making O'Neal one of just 32 athletes in American professional sports history to have their jersey retired by multiple teams.[155][156] The Heat eventually retired his jersey on December 22, 2016, during halftime of a game against his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n### Media personality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal in 1998\nO'Neal called himself \"The Big Aristotle\" and \"Hobo Master\" for his composure and insights during interviews. Journalists and others gave O'Neal several nicknames, including \"Shaq\", \"The Diesel\", \"Shaq Fu\", \"The Big Daddy\", \"Superman\", \"The Big Agave\", \"The Big Cactus\", \"The Big Shaqtus\", \"The Big Galactus\", \"Wilt Chamberneezy\", \"The Big Baryshnikov\", \"The Real Deal\", \"The Big Shamrock\", \"The Big Leprechaun\", \"Shaqovic\",[157][158] and \"The Big Conductor\".[159] Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press, O'Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking.[160] When he did not want to speak with the press, he employed an interview technique whereby, sitting in front of his cubicle, he would murmur in his low-pitched voice.[160][161]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike, O'Neal performed in a commercial for Disney. O'Neal was fined by the union for crossing the picket line.[162][163]\n\n\nO'Neal's humorous and sometimes incendiary comments fueled the Los Angeles Lakers' long-standing rivalry with the Sacramento Kings; O'Neal frequently referred to the Sacramento team as the \"Queens\".[164][165][166] During the 2002 victory parade, O'Neal declared that Sacramento would never be the capital of California,[167] after the Lakers beat the Kings in a tough seven-game series en route to its third championship with O'Neal.\n\n\nHe also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O'Neal told a reporter, \"you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so.\"[168] O'Neal later said it was locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but he said many Asians wouldn't see the humor.[169] Yao joked, \"Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with it when I was little.\"[170] O'Neal later expressed regret for the way he treated Yao early in his career.[171]\n\n\nDuring the 2005 NBA playoffs, O'Neal compared his poor play to Erick Dampier,[172] a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games. The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult. The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals.[173]\n\n\nO'Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, he responded, \"I'm sorry, who?\" and continued to pretend that he did not know who Bryant was until well into the 2005–06 season.[174]\n\n\nO'Neal also appeared on television on *Saturday Night Live* (he was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by Kelsey Grammer; however, he did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted *Shaq's Big Challenge*, a reality show on ABC in which he challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape.\n\n\nWhen the Lakers faced the Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify the end of the so-called \"Bryant–O'Neal feud\" that had festered since O'Neal left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend Bill Russell to make peace with Bryant.[175] On June 22, 2008, O'Neal freestyled a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O'Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a vasectomy, as part of a rhyme. He also taunted Bryant for not being able to win a championship without him. O'Neal led the audience to mockingly chant several times \"Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes\".[176] O'Neal justified his act by saying \"I was freestyling. That's all. It was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever. That is what MCs do. They freestyle when called upon. I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all.\"[177] Although even other exponents of hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg, Nas and Cory Gunz, agreed with O'Neal,[178] Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his intention to relieve O'Neal of his Maricopa County sheriff posse badge, due to \"use of a racially derogatory word and other foul language\". The racial quote from his song was \"it's like a white boy trying to be more nigga than me.\"[179]\n\n\n\n### Music career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Shaquille O'Neal + DIESEL (DJ)\n |\n| --- |\n| ![DIESEL DJing at the 2018 All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game](image)DIESEL DJing at the 2018 All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game\n |\n| Background information |\n| Genres | Hip hop, electronic dance music |\n| Occupation(s) | Rapper, DJ |\n| Years active | 1993–2001; 2017–present |\n| Labels | Jive, Interscope, A&M, Trauma, Monstercat |\n\n\nBeginning in 1993, O'Neal began to compose rap music. He released five studio albums and 1 compilation album. Although his rapping abilities were criticized at the outset,[180][181] one critic credited him with \"progressing as a rapper in small steps, not leaps and bounds\".[182] His 1993 debut album, *Shaq Diesel*, received platinum certification from the RIAA.\n\n\nO'Neal was featured alongside Michael Jackson as a guest rapper on \"2 Bad\", a song from Jackson's 1995 album *HIStory*. He contributed three tracks, including the song \"We Genie\", to the *Kazaam* soundtrack.[183] O'Neal was also featured in Aaron Carter's 2001 hit single \"That's How I Beat Shaq\". Shaq also appears in the music video for the release.[184]\n\n\nShaquille O'Neal conducted the Boston Pops Orchestra at the Boston Symphony Hall on December 20, 2010.\n\n\nO'Neal also started DJing in the 1980s at LSU.[185]\n\n\n\n#### As DJ Diesel[edit]\n\n\nCurrently, O'Neal produces electronic dance music and tours the world under the stage name DJ Diesel.[186]\n\n\nIn July 2017, O'Neal released a diss track aimed at LaVar Ball, the father of NBA point guard Lonzo Ball. The three-minute song was released in response to Ball claiming him and his younger son LaMelo, would beat O'Neal and his son Shareef in a game of basketball.\n\n\nOn October 23, 2021, O'Neal performed as DJ Diesel on the bassPOD stage at the 2021 Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, Nevada.[187][188][189]\n\n\nOn June 7, 2023, O'Neal released his first single as DJ Diesel from his debut album *Gorilla Warfare*, titled \"Bang Your Head\" in collaboration with Hairitage.[190] The album was released on August 18.[191]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal left LSU for the NBA after three years. However, he promised his mother he would eventually return to his studies and complete his bachelor's degree. He fulfilled that promise in 2000, earning his B.A. degree in general studies from LSU,[192] with a minor in political science.[193] Coach Phil Jackson let O'Neal miss a home game so he could attend graduation. At the ceremony, he told the crowd \"now I can go and get a real job\".\nSubsequently, O'Neal earned an online MBA degree through the University of Phoenix in 2005. In reference to his completion of his MBA degree, he stated: \"It's just something to have on my resume for when I go back into reality. Someday I might have to put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else.\"[194]\n\n\nToward the end of his playing career, he began work on an educational doctorate at Barry University.[195][196] His doctoral capstone[197][198] topic was \"The Duality of Humor and Aggression in Leadership Styles\".[195][199] O'Neal received his Ed.D. degree in Human Resource Development from Barry in 2012.[200] O'Neal told a reporter for ABC News that he plans to further his education by attending law school.[201]\n\n\nIn 2009, O'Neal attended the Sportscaster U. training camp at S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, saying \"You have to know what you're doing... I needed to learn the secrets\".[202][203]\n\n\nO'Neal has also studied directing and cinematography with the New York Film Academy's Filmmaking Conservatory.[204]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal maintained a high level of interest in the workings of police departments and became personally involved in law enforcement. O'Neal went through the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Reserve Academy and became a reserve officer with the Los Angeles Port Police. \nOn March 2, 2005, O'Neal was given an honorary U.S. Deputy Marshal title and named the spokesman for the Safe Surfin' Foundation; he served an honorary role on the task force of the same name, which tracks down sexual predators who target children on the Internet.[205]\n\n\nUpon his trade to Miami, O'Neal began training to become a Miami Beach reserve officer. On December 8, 2005, he was sworn in, but elected for a private ceremony to avoid distracting attention from the other officers. He assumed a $1-per-year salary in this capacity.[206] Shortly thereafter, in Miami, O'Neal witnessed a hate crime (assaulting a man while calling out homophobic slurs) and called Miami-Dade police, describing the suspect and helping police, over his cell phone, track the offender.[206] O'Neal's actions resulted in the arrest of two suspects on charges of aggravated battery, assault, and a hate crime.[207]\n\n\nIn September 2006, O'Neal took part in a raid on a home in rural Bedford County, Virginia. O'Neal had been made an \"honorary deputy\" by the local sheriff's department. O'Neal was not qualified as a SWAT officer.[208]\n\n\nIn June 2008, the Bedford County, Virginia, and Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff departments revoked O'Neal's special deputyship after a video surfaced of him rapping about Kobe Bryant and using racial slurs.[209][210]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2015, O'Neal was sworn in as a reserve officer for Doral, Florida's police force.[211] In December 2016, O'Neal was sworn in as a sheriff's deputy in Jonesboro, Georgia, as part of Clayton County, Georgia Sheriff's Department. O'Neal holds the county record of Tallest Sheriff's Deputy.[212]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nStarting with *Blue Chips* and *Kazaam*, O'Neal appeared in films that were panned by some critics.[213][214]\n\n\nO'Neal is one of the first African Americans to portray a major comic book superhero in a motion picture, having starred as John Henry Irons, the protagonist in the 1997 film *Steel*. He is preceded only by Michael Jai White, whose film *Spawn* was released two weeks before *Steel*.\n\n\nO'Neal appeared as himself on an episode of *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, bedridden after Larry David's character accidentally tripped him while stretching, and in two episodes each of *My Wife and Kids* and *The Parkers*. He appeared in cameo roles in the films *Freddy Got Fingered*, *Jack and Jill* and *Scary Movie 4*. O'Neal appeared in the 311 music video for the hit single \"You Wouldn't Believe\" in 2001, in P. Diddy's video for \"Bad Boy for Life\", the video for Aaron Carter's \"That's How I Beat Shaq\", the video for Owl City's \"Vanilla Twilight\" and the video for Maroon 5's \"Don't Wanna Know\". O'Neal appeared in the movie *CB4* in a small \"interviewing\" scene. O'Neal appeared in a *SportsCenter* commercial dressed in his Miami police uniform, rescuing Mike the Tiger from a tree. O'Neal reportedly wanted a role in *X2* (2003), the second installment of the *X-Men* film series, but was ignored by the filmmakers.[215] O'Neal appeared as Officer Fluzoo in the comedy sequel *Grown Ups 2*.\n\n\nHe voiced animated versions of himself on several occasions, including in the animated series *Static Shock* (2002; episode \"Static Shaq\"), in *Johnny Bravo* (1997; episode \"Back on Shaq\"), in *Uncle Grandpa* (2014; episode \"Perfect Kid\"), and in *The Lego Movie* (2014). He also had a voice over role in the 2013 film *The Smurfs 2*.[216]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal was featured on the covers of video games *NBA Live 96*, *NBA 2K6*, *NBA 2K7*, *NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC*, *NBA Hoopz*, and *NBA Inside Drive 2004*.[217][218][219][220] O'Neal appeared in the arcade version of *NBA Jam* (1993), *NBA Jam* (2003) and *NBA Live 2004* as a current player and as a 1990s All-Star. O'Neal starred in *Shaq Fu*, a fighting game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis. A sequel, *Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn*, was released in 2018.[221] O'Neal also appeared in *Quest for the Code* in 2002 as a voice actor,[222] *Backyard Basketball* in 2004, *Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2* as a playable boxer, and as an unlockable character in *Delta Force: Black Hawk Down*. O'Neal was also an unlockable character in *UFC Undisputed 2010*.[223]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal and his mother, Lucille Harrison, were featured in the documentary film *Apple Pie*, which aired on ESPN.[224][225] O'Neal had a 2005 reality series on ESPN, *Shaquille*,[226] and hosted a series called *Shaq's Big Challenge* on ABC.[227]\n\n\nO'Neal appeared on *NBA Ballers* and *NBA Ballers: Phenom*,[228] in the 2002 Discovery Channel special *Motorcycle Mania 2* requesting an exceptionally large bike to fit his large size famed custom motorcycle builder Jesse James,[229] in the first Idol Gives Back in 2007,[230] on an episode of *Fear Factor*,[231] and on an episode of MTV's *Jackass*, where he was lifted off the ground on Wee Man's back.[232] O'Neal was a wrestling fan and made appearances at many WWE and AEW events.[233]\n\n\nO'Neal was pranked on the MTV show *Punk'd* when a crew member accused him of stealing his parking space. After O'Neal and his wife went into a restaurant, Ashton Kutcher's crew members let the air out of O'Neal's tires. O'Neal and the crew member then got into an altercation and after Kutcher told O'Neal he had been Punk'd, O'Neal made an obscene gesture at the camera.[234][235]\n\n\nO'Neal starred in a reality show called *Shaq Vs.* which premiered on August 18, 2009, on ABC.[236] The show featured O'Neal competing against other athletes at their own sports.[237]\n\n\nOn July 14, 2011, O'Neal announced that he would join Turner Network Television (TNT) as an analyst on its NBA basketball games, joining Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley.[238]\n\n\nHe hosted the show *Upload with Shaquille O'Neal* which aired on TruTV for one season.\n\n\nIn September 2015 whilst promoting sportswear giant Reebok in South Korea, O'Neal joined the cast in the South Korean variety television show *Off to School* where he went to Seo Incheon High School. The show features various celebrities attending a selected high school as students for three days.[239] The producer of the show, Kim No-eun said, \"We've worked hard on our guest list this season, so Chu Sung Hoon will be appearing on a cable channel for the first time. Shaquille O'Neal will be on the show as well. We succeeded in casting him after a lot of effort. O'Neal will be visiting Korea for a promotion and will be visiting the school on the last day. He will have lunch with the students. We're even preparing a big match between Chu Sung Hoon and Shaquille O'Neal. We're specially preparing a uniform for Shaquille O'Neal.\"[240][241][242]\n\n\nIn October 2022, O'Neal signed a long-term contract extension with Warner Bros.

According to Dave Meltzer of *Wrestling Observer Newsletter*, the match was canceled due to monetary reasons, as both parties could not agree on a deal.[260] Big Show later stated it was scheduling issues on O'Neal's part that caused the cancellation.[261]\n\n\nOn the November 11, 2020 episode of *AEW Dynamite*, Jade Cargill interrupted Cody Rhodes and teased the arrival of O'Neal in All Elite Wrestling (AEW).[262][263] He made a cameo appearance on *Being The Elite* and it was later confirmed that O'Neal had been appearing backstage at recent AEW tapings, including Full Gear.[264][265][266] He appeared on the December 9 episode of *AEW Dynamite* and addressed AEW in a sit-down interview with Tony Schiavone and Brandi Rhodes.[267] At the end of the interview, O'Neal got water thrown on him by Brandi after telling her to get pointers from Cargill, who had broken Brandi's arm several weeks ago.[268][269] On the March 3, 2021 episode of *AEW Dynamite* titled The Crossroads, O'Neal teamed with Jade Cargill to defeat Cody Rhodes and Red Velvet.

O'Neal was looking to expand his business ventures with real-estate development projects aimed at assisting Orlando home owners facing foreclosure. His plans involved buying the mortgages of those who had fallen into foreclosure and then selling the homes back to them under more affordable terms. He would make a small profit in return, but wanted to make an investment in Orlando and help out homeowners.[274]\n\n\nIn conjunction with Boraie Development, O'Neal has developed projects in his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, including, CityPlex12 and One Riverview.[275][276][277][278][279]\n\n\nO'Neal is on the advisory board for Tout Industries, a social video service startup company based in San Francisco.[133] He received the position in return for breaking news of his NBA retirement on the service.[280]\n\n\nIn September 2013, O'Neal became a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings.[281] In January 2022, O'Neal sold his stake in the Kings.[282]\n\n\nO'Neal was an early investor in Google.[272] In June 2015, he invested in technology startup Loyale3 Holdings Inc., a San Francisco brokerage firm whose website and mobile app enables companies to sell a piece of their IPOs directly to small investors who put up as a little as $100 and also allows investors to regularly buy small amounts of shares in already public companies.[273]\n\n\nO'Neal is an investor for esports team NRG Esports.[283] He has also appeared in television commercials promoting the *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* league *ELeague*.[284]\n\n\nO'Neal favors franchising businesses because of their simplicity and proven success.[272] In late 2016, he purchased the Krispy Kreme location at 295 Ponce de Leon Avenue in Atlanta.

Darling also alleged that O'Neal had used law enforcement contacts to obtain restricted information on those mistresses, and that O'Neal subsequently threw his laptop into a lake to destroy possible evidence.[300] In 2017, a trial court ruled that Darling had not filed the lawsuit \"in good faith\", and that the accusations made by Darling occurred after he had attempted to extort $12,000,000 from O'Neal in return for thousands of stolen emails and electronic files.[301] Throughout the trial, Darling failed to submit adequate evidence to back up his claims. In 2021, the litigation ended with a court ruling that O'Neal was entitled to $412,914.50 in legal fees.[301]\n\n\nIn April 2014, O'Neal posted a photo on Instagram that showed himself mocking Jahmel Binion who suffers from Ectodermal dysplasia.[302][303] O'Neal issued a public apology, stating that he and Binion had spoken and that he's \"made a friend today\".[302] Binion would however go on to sue O'Neal for a sum larger than $25,000.[302] In 2016, Binion withdrew the lawsuit after coming to a settlement agreement with O'Neal.[304]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal at the 2009 NBA All-Star game\nO'Neal was raised by a Baptist mother and a Muslim stepfather and said that they taught him both.[305][306] Both Robin Wright in her book *Rock the Casbah* as well as the *Los Angeles Times* have identified O'Neal as a Muslim.[307][308][309] However, O'Neal has said, \"I'm Muslim, I'm Jewish, I'm Buddhist, I'm everybody 'cause I'm a people person.\"[310]\n\n\n\n### Marriage and children[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal married Shaunie Nelson on December 26, 2002.

He is a 7-foot-1-inch (2.16 m) and 325-pound (147 kg) center who played for six teams over his 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is a four-time NBA champion. O'Neal is regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nAfter playing college basketball for the LSU Tigers, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid a feud between O'Neal and his teammate Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.[6] O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.[7]\n\n\nO'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award; the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award; 15 All-Star Game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards; three Finals MVP awards; two scoring titles; 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 8th all-time in points scored, 6th in field goals, 15th in rebounds, and 8th in blocks. O'Neal was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996.[8] Due to his ability to dunk the basketball and score from close range, O'Neal also ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%) and led the league in field goal percentage ten times.[9] O'Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.[10] He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017.[11] In October 2021, O'Neal was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[12]\n\n\nIn addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, *Shaq Diesel*, going platinum. O'Neal is also an electronic music producer, and touring DJ, known as DIESEL.[13] He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, *Shaq's Big Challenge* and *Shaq Vs.* He hosts *The Big Podcast with Shaq*.[14] He was a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings from 2013 to 2022 and is the general manager of Kings Guard Gaming of the NBA 2K League.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal playing for the Cole High School varsity basketball team in 1988–89\nO'Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey,[16] to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school basketball (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall. Toney struggled with drug addiction and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's Jamaican stepfather, Phillip Arthur Harrison, a career Army sergeant.[17][18] O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship.[18] On his 1994 rap album, *Shaq Fu: The Return*, O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song \"Biological Didn't Bother\", dismissing him with the line \"Phil is my father.\" However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O'Neal telling him, \"I don't hate you. I had a good life. I had Phil.\"[19]\n\n\nO'Neal came from a tall family. His father and mother were 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall, respectively, and by age 13, O'Neal was already 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall. He credited the Boys & Girls Clubs of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. \"It gave me something to do,\" he said. \"I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team.\"[20] Because of his stepfather's career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to military bases in Germany and Texas.[21]\n\n\nAfter returning from Germany, O'Neal's family settled in San Antonio, Texas. By age 16, O'Neal had grown to 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), and he began playing basketball at Robert G. Cole High School. He led his team to a 68–1 record over two years and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year.[22] His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification.[23] O'Neal's tendency to make hook shots earned comparisons to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, inspiring him to wear the same jersey number as Abdul-Jabbar, No. 33. However, his high school team did not have a *33* jersey, so O'Neal chose to wear No. 32 before college.[24]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school, O'Neal studied business at Louisiana State University (LSU). He had first met Tigers coach Dale Brown years earlier in Europe when O'Neal's stepfather was stationed on a U.S. Army base at Wildflecken, West Germany. While playing for Brown at LSU, O'Neal was a two-time All-American, two-time SEC Player of the Year, and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991; he was also named college player of the year by AP and UPI. O'Neal left LSU early to pursue his NBA career, but continued his education even after becoming a professional player.[25] He was later inducted into the LSU Hall of Fame.[26] A 900-pound (410 kg) bronze statue of O'Neal is located in front of the LSU Basketball Practice Facility.[27]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (1992–1996)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (1992–1993)[edit]\n\n\nThe Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. In the summer before moving to Orlando, he spent time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson.[28] O'Neal wore number 32 because Terry Catledge refused to relinquish the 33 jersey.[24] O'Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA, the first player to do so.[29] During his rookie season, O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season. He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985.[30] The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season, but missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers. On more than one occasion during the year, *Sports Illustrated* writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying, \"We've got to get [head coach] Matty [Guokas] out of here and bring in [assistant] Brian [Hill].\"[31]\n\n\n\n#### First playoff appearance (1993–1994)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993–1994, O'Neal's second season, Hill was the coach and Guokas was reassigned to the front office.[32] O'Neal improved his scoring average to 29.4 points (second in the league to David Robinson) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at 60%. On November 20, 1993, against the New Jersey Nets, O'Neal registered the first triple-double of his career, recording 24 points to go along with career highs of 28 rebounds and 15 blocks.[33] He was voted into the All-Star game and also made the All-NBA 3rd Team. Teamed with newly drafted Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway, the Magic finished with a record of 50–32 and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.[34] In his first playoff series, O'Neal averaged 20.7 points and 13.3 rebounds[35][*unreliable source*] as the Pacers swept the Magic.[36][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n#### First scoring title and NBA Finals (1994–1996)[edit]\n\n\nIn O'Neal's third season, 1994–95, he led the NBA in scoring with a 29.3 point average, while finishing second in MVP voting to David Robinson and entering his third straight All-Star Game along with Hardaway. They formed one of the league's top duos and helped Orlando to a 57–25 record and the Atlantic Division crown. The Magic won their first-ever playoff series against the Boston Celtics in the 1995 NBA Playoffs. They then defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinals. After beating Reggie Miller's Indiana Pacers, the Magic reached the NBA Finals, facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. O'Neal played well in his first Finals appearance, averaging 28 points on 59.5% shooting, 12.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists. Despite this, the Rockets, led by future Hall-of-Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, swept the series in four games.[37]\n\n\nO'Neal was injured for a great deal of the 1995–96 season, missing 28 games. He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game, made the All-NBA 3rd Team, and played in his 4th All-Star Game. Despite O'Neal's injuries, the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60–22, second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls, who finished with an NBA record 72 wins. Orlando easily defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the 1996 NBA Playoffs; however, they were no match for Jordan's Bulls, who swept them in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004)[edit]\n\n\n#### O'Neal–Bryant tandem buildup (1996–1999)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 8 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004), O'Neal won three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 and appeared in the 2004 NBA Finals.\nO'Neal became a free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the *Orlando Sentinel* published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning.[38][39] 82% answered \"no\".[38] O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill.[40][41] He said the team \"just didn't respect [Hill]\".[42] Another question in the poll asked whether O'Neal was worth $115 million, in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer; 91.3% of the response said it was not.[39][40] O'Neal's Olympic teammates teased him over the poll.[39][41] He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry.[38] O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to \"feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond\".[43] He also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him.[44]\n\n\nOn the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, the media announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121 million contract.[45][46] O'Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\"[47][48] The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season.[49] O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games.[50] In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The *Los Angeles Daily News* reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: \"It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.\"[51]\n\n\nThe following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61–21, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4–0 sweep.[52]\n\n\nWith the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar Kobe Bryant, expectations for the Lakers increased; however, personnel changes were a source of instability during the 1998–99 season. Long-time Laker point guard Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets; his former backcourt partner Eddie Jones was packaged with back-up center Elden Campbell for Glen Rice to satisfy a demand by O'Neal for a shooter. Coach Del Harris was fired, and former Lakers forward Kurt Rambis finished the season as head coach. The Lakers finished with a 31–19 record during the lockout-shortened season. Although they made the playoffs, they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs. The Spurs would go on to win their first NBA title in 1999.\n\n\n\n#### MVP and championship seasons (1999–2002)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal during Game 5 of the 2000 NBA Finals\nIn 1999, prior to the 1999–2000 season, the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach, and the team's fortunes soon changed. Jackson immediately challenged O'Neal, telling him \"the [NBA's] MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired.\"[53]\n\n\nIn the November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.[54] On March 6, 2000, O'Neal's 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123–103 win over the LA Clippers.[55] O'Neal's 61-point game is the most recent game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer.[56]\n\n\nO'Neal was also voted the 1999–2000 regular season Most Valuable Player, one vote short of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Fred Hickman, then of CNN, instead chose Allen Iverson, then of the Philadelphia 76ers who would go on to win MVP the next season. O'Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots. Jackson's influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O'Neal to defense, resulting in his first All-Defensive Team selection (second-team) in 2000.[57]\n\n\nIn the 2001 NBA Finals against the 76ers, O'Neal fouled out in Game 3 backing over Dikembe Mutombo, the 2000–2001 Defensive Player of the Year. \"I didn't think the best defensive player in the game would be flopping like that. It's a shame that the referees buy into that\", O'Neal said. \"I wish he'd stand up and play me like a man instead of flopping and crying every time I back him down.[58]\n\n\nA month before the 2001–02 season's training camp, O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot.[59] He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker.[60] He was ready for the start of the 2001–02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him.[59]\n\n\nIn January 2002, he was involved in a spectacular on-court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls. He punched center Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket, resulting in a melee with Miller, forward Charles Oakley, and several other players.[61] O'Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000.[62] For the season, O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, excellent statistics but below his career average; he was less of a defensive force during the season.[59]\n\n\nMatched up against the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 Western Conference finals, O'Neal said, \"There is only one way to beat us. It starts with c and ends with t.\" O'Neal meant \"cheat\" in reference to the alleged flopping of Kings' center Vlade Divac. O'Neal referred to Divac as \"she\", and said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul. \"I'm a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work.\"[63] \nAfter the 2001–2002 season, O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.[59]\n\n\nUsing Jackson's triangle offense, O'Neal and Bryant enjoyed tremendous success, leading the Lakers to three consecutive titles (2000, 2001, and 2002). O'Neal was named MVP of the NBA Finals all three times and had the highest scoring average for a center in NBA Finals history.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Toe surgery to departure (2002–2004)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal missed the first 12 games of the 2002–03 season recovering from toe surgery.[65] He was sidelined with hallux rigidus, a degenerative arthritis in his toe.[66] He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained, \"I got hurt on company time, so I'll heal on company time.\"[67] O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure.[66] The Lakers started the season with a record of 11–19.[68] At the end of the season, the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003.\n\n\nFor the 2003–04 season, the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of two aging stars—forward Karl Malone and guard Gary Payton—but due to salary cap restrictions, could not offer either player nearly as much money as he could have made with some other teams. O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season, O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. During a preseason game, O'Neal had yelled at Lakers owner Jerry Buss, \"Pay me.\"[69] There had been increasing tension between O'Neal and Bryant. The feud climaxed during training camp prior to the 2003–2004 season when Bryant, in an interview with ESPN journalist Jim Gray, criticized O'Neal for being out of shape, a poor leader, and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the team.[70]\n\n\nThe Lakers made the playoffs in 2004 and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter said, \"Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He's always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding\".[71] After the series, O'Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak regarding O'Neal's future with the club, as well as by the departure of Lakers coach Phil Jackson at the request of Buss. O'Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team's decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns, and O'Neal promptly demanded a trade. Kupchak wanted the Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki in return but Mavericks owner Mark Cuban refused to let his 7-footer go. However, Miami showed interest, and eventually the two clubs agreed on a trade.[72] Winter said, \"[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much.\"[73]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2004–2008)[edit]\n\n\n#### MVP runner-up (2004–2005)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Miami in 2007\nOn July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, and a future first-round draft choice (the Lakers used the draft choice to select Jordan Farmar in the 2006 draft). O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star Dwyane Wade, to whom he gave the nickname \"Flash\". With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. O'Neal made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference Player of the Month award for his performance in March. O'Neal also narrowly lost the 2004–05 MVP Award to Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash in one of the closest votes in NBA history.[74]\n\n\nDespite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference Finals and a Game 7 against the defending champion Detroit Pistons, losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O'Neal.[75] \nIn August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100 million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20 million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth championship (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\nIn the second game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities.[67] O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a \"frontrunner\" and a \"master of panic.\"[77] Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview \"Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game.\"[78] During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a .500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.[79]\n\n\n\nOn April 11, 2006, O'Neal recorded his second career triple-double against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists.[80] O'Neal finished the 2005–06 season as the league leader in field goal percentage.[80]\n\n![](image)O'Neal holding the championship ball when the NBA Champion Heat visited the White House\nIn the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2–0 lead in the series. Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3–1 series lead. The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat \nheld on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first-ever NBA Finals.[81]\n\n\nIn the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks led by Dirk Nowitzki, and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion. The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title. With Wade carrying the offensive load, O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Surgery and Wade's injury (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, O'Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery.[82][83] After one of those missed games, a Christmas Day match-up against the Lakers, he ripped Jackson, who O'Neal had once called a second father, referring to his former coach as \"Benedict Arnold\". Jackson had previously said, \"The only person I've ever [coached] that hasn't been a worker... is probably Shaq.\"[84] The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence,[85] but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team.[85] Critics doubted that O'Neal, now in his mid-30s, could carry the team into the playoffs.[86] The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.[85]\n\n\nIn a rematch of the year before, the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006–07 NBA playoffs. The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round.[87] It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006–07 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Career lows and disagreements (2007–2008)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007–08 season, averaging career lows in points, rebounds, and blocks. His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O'Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season.[9] O'Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15–game losing streak.[88] According to O'Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury.[89] During a practice in February 2008, O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal.[90] O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not \"all that good\" by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.[91]\n\n\nO'Neal played 33 games for the Miami Heat in the 2007–08 season prior to being traded to the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal started all 33 games and averaged 14.2 points per game. Following the trade to Phoenix, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points while starting all 28 games with the Suns.\n\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns (2008–2009)[edit]\n\n\nThe Phoenix Suns acquired O'Neal in February 2008 from the league-worst Miami Heat, who had a record at the time of the trade of 9–37, in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[92] O'Neal made his Suns debut on February 20, 2008, against his former Lakers team, scoring 15 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in the process. The Lakers won, 130–124. O'Neal was upbeat in a post-game press conference, stating: \"I will take the blame for this loss because I wasn't in tune with the guys [...] But give me four or five days to really get in tune and I'll get it.\"[93]\n\n\nIn 28 regular season games, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points and 10.6 rebounds,[94] good enough to make the playoffs. One of the reasons for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, especially after the Suns' six-game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs.[95] O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, but they were once again eliminated, in five games. O'Neal averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.[94]\n\n\nO'Neal preferred his new situation with the Suns over the Heat. \"I love playing for this coach and I love playing with these guys\", O'Neal said. \"We have professionals who know what to do. No one is asking me to play with [his former Heat teammates] Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis. I'm actually on a team again.\" Riley felt O'Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates. O'Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley, whom he often referred to as the \"great Pat Riley\" while playing for the Heat.[96] O'Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career.[97] They connected his arthritic toe, which would not bend, to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg. The trainers had him concentrate on building his core strength, flexibility, and balance.[98]\n\n\nThe 2008–09 season improved for O'Neal, who averaged 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks through the first half (41 games) of the season, leading the Suns to a 23–18 record and 2nd place in their division.[99] He returned to the All-Star Game in 2009 and emerged as co-MVP along with ex-teammate Kobe Bryant.\n\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Phoenix teammate Steve Nash\nOn February 27, 2009, O'Neal scored 45 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, his 49th career 40-point game, beating the Toronto Raptors 133–113.\n\n\nIn a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. \"I'm really too old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds\", O'Neal said, referring to the then 23-year-old Howard. \"It's not really my role anymore.\" O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. \"I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool\", said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was \"very disappointed cause [O'Neal] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.\"[100] O'Neal responded, \"Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching.\"[101] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since \"everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back.\"[102] In a 2006 interview in *TIME*, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would \"Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass.\"[103]\n\n\nOn March 6, O'Neal talked about the upcoming game against the Rockets and Yao Ming. \"It's not going to be man-on-man, so don't even try that,\" says O'Neal with an incredulous laugh. \"They're going to double and triple me like everybody else ... I rarely get to play [Yao] one-on-one ... But when I play him (on defense), it's just going to be me down there. So don't try to make it a Yao versus Shaq thing, when it's Shaq versus four other guys.\"[104]\n\n\nThe 2009 NBA Playoffs was also the first time since O'Neal's rookie season in 1992–93 that he did not participate in the playoffs. He was named as a member of the All-NBA Third Team. The Suns notified O'Neal he might be traded to cut costs.[105]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, 2009, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Sasha Pavlovic, Ben Wallace, $500,000, and a 2010 second-round draft pick.[106] Upon arriving in Cleveland, O'Neal said, \"My motto is very simple: Win a Ring for the King\", referring to LeBron James.[107] James was the leader of the team, and O'Neal deferred to him.[108] On February 25, 2010, O'Neal suffered a severe right thumb injury while attempting to go up for a shot against Glen Davis of the Boston Celtics.[109] He had surgery on the thumb on March 1 and returned to play in time for the first round of the playoffs.[110] After defeating the Chicago Bulls in the first round, the Cavaliers went on to lose to the Boston Celtics in the second round. In September 2016, O'Neal said: \"When I was in Cleveland, we were in first place. Big Baby [Glen Davis] breaks my hand and I had to sit out five weeks late in the year. I come back finally in the first round of the playoffs, and we lost to Boston in the second round. I was upset. I know for a fact if I was healthy, we would have gotten it done that year and won a ring.\"[111] O'Neal averaged career lows in almost every major statistical category during the 2009–10 season, taking on a much less significant role than in previous years.\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal finished his career with the Boston Celtics.\nUpon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O'Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Celtics, saw an opportunity to acquire O'Neal.[112] Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O'Neal would not receive preferential treatment, nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami.[113] On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal.[114] The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8 million.[115] O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal.[116] The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands.[117][118] He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.[119]\n\n\nO'Neal said he did not \"compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe.\" O'Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan: \"If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that.\"[120] Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected to be part of the second unit.[120] Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself.[121] O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg[122] including knee,[123] calf,[124] hip,[125] and Achilles injuries.[126] The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,[122] and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[127] After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf.[122][128] It was the last regular season game he would play that year.[129] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.[130][131]\n\n\nOn June 1, 2011, O'Neal announced his retirement via social media.[132][133] On a short video on Twitter, O'Neal tweeted, \"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.\" On June 3, 2011, O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement.[134]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nWhile in college, O'Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner.[135] His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament. While he led the Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup.\n\n\nHe was one of two players (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.[136]\n\n\nAfter his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition. He was angered by being overlooked for the 1999 FIBA AmeriCup squad, saying it was a \"lack of respect\".[137] He forwent an opportunity to participate in the 2000 Olympics, explaining that two gold medals were enough.[138] O'Neal also chose not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[139] He rejected an offer to play in the 2004 Olympics,[140] and although he was initially interested in being named for 2006–2008 US preliminary roster,[141] he eventually declined the invitation.[142]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal's free throw shooting was regarded as one of his major weaknesses.\nO'Neal established himself as an overpowering low post presence, putting up career averages of 23.7 points on .582 field goal accuracy, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game.\n\n\nAt 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m), 330 lb (150 kg)[143] and U.S. shoe size 23,[65] he became famous for his physical stature. His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents. On two occasions during his first season in the NBA, his powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports, prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.[144]\n\n\nO'Neal's \"drop step\", (called the \"Black Tornado\" by O'Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage slam dunk, proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time.[145] He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of nine.[65]\n\n\nOpposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[146]\n\n\nO'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.[147] O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80 percent in practice.[148] In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as \"Hack-a-Shaq\". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,[149] having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.[150]\n\n\nO'Neal only made one three-point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three-point-shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).\n\n\nO'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.[151]\n\n\nPhil Jackson believed O'Neal underachieved in his career, saying he \"could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons.\"[152] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named O'Neal as the 8th greatest player in NBA history.[153]\n\n\nThe Lakers retired his No. 34 jersey on April 2, 2013.[154] On February 26, 2016, the Miami Heat announced that it would retire O'Neal's No. 32 jersey during the 2016–17 season, making O'Neal one of just 32 athletes in American professional sports history to have their jersey retired by multiple teams.[155][156] The Heat eventually retired his jersey on December 22, 2016, during halftime of a game against his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n### Media personality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal in 1998\nO'Neal called himself \"The Big Aristotle\" and \"Hobo Master\" for his composure and insights during interviews. Journalists and others gave O'Neal several nicknames, including \"Shaq\", \"The Diesel\", \"Shaq Fu\", \"The Big Daddy\", \"Superman\", \"The Big Agave\", \"The Big Cactus\", \"The Big Shaqtus\", \"The Big Galactus\", \"Wilt Chamberneezy\", \"The Big Baryshnikov\", \"The Real Deal\", \"The Big Shamrock\", \"The Big Leprechaun\", \"Shaqovic\",[157][158] and \"The Big Conductor\".[159] Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press, O'Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking.[160] When he did not want to speak with the press, he employed an interview technique whereby, sitting in front of his cubicle, he would murmur in his low-pitched voice.[160][161]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike, O'Neal performed in a commercial for Disney. O'Neal was fined by the union for crossing the picket line.[162][163]\n\n\nO'Neal's humorous and sometimes incendiary comments fueled the Los Angeles Lakers' long-standing rivalry with the Sacramento Kings; O'Neal frequently referred to the Sacramento team as the \"Queens\".[164][165][166] During the 2002 victory parade, O'Neal declared that Sacramento would never be the capital of California,[167] after the Lakers beat the Kings in a tough seven-game series en route to its third championship with O'Neal.\n\n\nHe also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O'Neal told a reporter, \"you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so.\"[168] O'Neal later said it was locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but he said many Asians wouldn't see the humor.[169] Yao joked, \"Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with it when I was little.\"[170] O'Neal later expressed regret for the way he treated Yao early in his career.[171]\n\n\nDuring the 2005 NBA playoffs, O'Neal compared his poor play to Erick Dampier,[172] a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games. The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult. The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals.[173]\n\n\nO'Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, he responded, \"I'm sorry, who?\" and continued to pretend that he did not know who Bryant was until well into the 2005–06 season.[174]\n\n\nO'Neal also appeared on television on *Saturday Night Live* (he was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by Kelsey Grammer; however, he did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted *Shaq's Big Challenge*, a reality show on ABC in which he challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape.\n\n\nWhen the Lakers faced the Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify the end of the so-called \"Bryant–O'Neal feud\" that had festered since O'Neal left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend Bill Russell to make peace with Bryant.[175] On June 22, 2008, O'Neal freestyled a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O'Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a vasectomy, as part of a rhyme. He also taunted Bryant for not being able to win a championship without him. O'Neal led the audience to mockingly chant several times \"Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes\".[176] O'Neal justified his act by saying \"I was freestyling. That's all. It was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever. That is what MCs do. They freestyle when called upon. I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all.\"[177] Although even other exponents of hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg, Nas and Cory Gunz, agreed with O'Neal,[178] Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his intention to relieve O'Neal of his Maricopa County sheriff posse badge, due to \"use of a racially derogatory word and other foul language\".

Following his college basketball career at Georgetown University, his tenacity on defense twice earned him the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and twice placed him on the NBA All-Defensive Team. Mourning made a comeback after undergoing a kidney transplant and later won the 2006 NBA championship with the Heat. Mourning also played for the Charlotte Hornets and New Jersey Nets. On March 30, 2009, Mourning became the first Miami Heat player to have his number retired.[3] In 2010, Mourning was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In August 2014, Mourning was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and in August 2019 he was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDuring his time at Indian River High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, he led the team to 51 straight victories and a state title his junior year (1987). As a senior, he averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and 12 blocked shots per game. He was named Player of the Year by USA Today, Parade, Gatorade, and Naismith. He was the #1 recruit of the 1988 class, over Christian Laettner, Shawn Kemp, Billy Owens, Kenny Williams, Stanley Roberts, Rick Fox, and Malik Sealy, among others.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nMourning played college basketball for John Thompson at Georgetown University. He made an immediate impact as a freshman, starting all 34 games for the Hoyas, averaging 13.1 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. But his most notable accomplishment was leading the nation in total blocked shots (169) and blocks per game (5.0); both figures led the nation and set NCAA records for a freshman at that time.\n\n\nMourning's scoring and rebounding improved over the next two seasons, but his shot-blocking declined significantly, as his taller teammate Dikembe Mutombo established himself as starting center for Georgetown, forcing Mourning to play at power forward. After Mutombo entered the NBA draft in 1991, Mourning re-took his place as starting center, and responded with a spectacular senior season in 1991–92. He averaged 21.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 5.0 blocks per game that year, and collected numerous awards, including Consensus First-Team All-American and Big East Conference Player of the Year. He was also named Big East Defensive Player of the Year, which he had won twice previously (as a freshman in 1988–89, and again as a sophomore in 1989–90, sharing the award with Mutombo that season; Mutombo won the award alone in 1990–91).\n\n\nMourning finished his college career with 2,001 points and 1,032 rebounds, reaching the exclusive 2,000-point and 1,000-rebound milestone. More impressively, he finished with 453 blocked shots in his college career, ranking first all-time in NCAA history at that time. Interestingly, Mourning was never listed as the all-time leader in Georgetown history, as the school credits Patrick Ewing with 493 blocks during his college career,[4] but blocked shots were not an official NCAA statistic at that time.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Charlotte Hornets (1992–1995)[edit]\n\n\nMourning was selected second overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, behind Shaquille O'Neal and before Christian Laettner.[5] Mourning was named to the league's all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks. He finished second to Shaquille O'Neal in rookie of the year voting.[6] He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since David Robinson in the 1989–90 season to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104–103 victory in the game and a 3–1 victory in the series. The Hornets lost in the second round to the New York Knicks in five games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in nine playoff games. The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.\n\n\nIn the 1994–95 season, Mourning and teammate Larry Johnson led the Hornets to a 50-win season and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in scoring (21.3 per game), rebounding (9.9 per game), blocked shots (2.92 per game), and field goal percentage (.519), and played in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1995–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn November 3, 1995, after Mourning rejected Charlotte's contract extension offer worth an average of $11.2 million for seven years and knowing they would not be able to re-sign him, the Hornets traded him, along with reserves Pete Myers and LeRon Ellis in exchange for Glen Rice, Matt Geiger, Khalid Reeves and a first-round pick in the 1996 NBA draft.[7]\n\n\nMourning would immediately serve as the centerpiece of the Pat Riley-coached Heat, and in his first season in Miami he averaged 23.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game as Miami made the playoffs before being swept in the first round by the 72-win Bulls. Mourning played in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game and was joined by All-Star point guard Tim Hardaway who arrived through a mid-season trade.\n\n\nIn July 1996, Mourning signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Heat.[8] In the 1996–97 season, the Heat would go on to win a then franchise-record 61 games, finishing second in the Eastern Conference behind the defending champions Bulls, while Mourning averaged 19.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the Orlando Magic in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where the rivalry between the Heat and the New York Knicks intensified. The Knicks took a 3–1 series lead, but following a brawl between Charlie Ward and P. J. Brown late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down. Mourning scored 28 points in Game 6, followed by a 22-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 to help Miami advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, a franchise first, to face Chicago. The Bulls took a 3–0 series lead, and Mourning guaranteed a victory in Game 4 as the Heat won 87–80.[9] However, with a 100–87 loss in Game 5, the Heat were eliminated by the Bulls.\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Mourning played 58 games and averaged 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game as the Heat won 55 games. However, Miami lost in the first round to the Knicks, with Mourning missing the deciding Game 5 due to a suspension caused by a fight between Mourning and former teammate Larry Johnson in Game 4.[10] The brawl also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was seen dangling on Mourning's leg in an attempt to break up the fight.[11] The following season, the Heat won 31 games in a lockout-shortened 50-game schedule, and Mourning won his first of two consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards after leading the league in blocks with 3.9 per game. Despite finishing with the best record in the Eastern Conference, the Heat once again fell short to the Knicks in the first round, with Allan Houston securing the series victory with a last-second jumper in Game 5.[12][13] Mourning again led the NBA in blocks in the 1999–2000 season, this time with a 3.7 average, and won Defensive Player of the Year. Miami finished the regular season with 52 wins and faced the Knicks in the second round. But for a third straight season, the Heat lost to the Knicks in a winner-take-all game, this time in Game 7.[14]\n\n\nShortly after playing for the gold medal-winning U.S. national team in the 2000 Summer Olympics, Mourning was diagnosed with a serious kidney disease.[15] Initially deemed out for the remainder of the season, Mourning returned for the final 13 games, helping the Heat win 50 games despite playing limited minutes. However, Miami was swept 3–0 in the first round by the Hornets.[16] In the 2001–02 season, Mourning played 75 games and averaged 15.7 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game, earning his final All-Star nod. Despite that, the Heat missed the playoffs with a 36–46 record. Mourning missed the entire 2002–03 season as he continued to deal with a serious kidney disorder, and without their star center, the Heat won only 25 games and missed the playoffs again.[17]\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nMourning signed a four-year deal with the New Jersey Nets in July 2003 as a free agent.[18][19] On November 24, 2003, after appearing in 12 games, Mourning retired from the NBA due to complications from his kidney disease.[20][21] On December 19, he underwent a successful kidney transplant.[22] In 2004, he started practicing with the Nets again, and made the team's regular season roster during the 2004–05 season. He did not play a significant role with the Nets, however, and openly complained to the media that he wanted out of New Jersey, especially after the team traded away Kenyon Martin.[23][24] After playing in just 30 total games for New Jersey, Mourning, Eric Williams and Aaron Williams were traded to the Toronto Raptors for Vince Carter on December 17, 2004.[25][26] Mourning never reported to the Raptors, and was bought out of his contract at a remaining $9 million on February 11, 2005. Raptors team officials later said that he did not meet the medical conditions to play for the team.[27][28][29] Mourning then finished the season with the Heat being paid a second salary, the veteran's minimum.[30]\n\n\n\n### Return to the Heat (2005–2008)[edit]\n\n\nMourning re-signed with the Heat on March 1, 2005.[31] His role was reduced as a backup because of superstar Shaquille O'Neal, although he was called upon as a starter due to O'Neal missing stretches due to injury. O'Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning's tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the first seed in Eastern Conference during the 2004–05 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest. Miami swept the Nets in the first round of the playoffs, with Mourning recording 21 points and nine rebounds in just 16 minutes in Game 2. In the second round against the Washington Wizards, Mourning stepped in for the injured O'Neal and scored 14 points with 13 rebounds and blocked four shots in Game 3 as Miami completed another four-game sweep. Miami fell in seven games to the defending champions, the Detroit Pistons, in the Eastern Conference Finals, with Mourning leading the team in blocks with three per game for the series.\n\n\nOn June 17, 2005, the Heat picked up the team option on Mourning,[32] as the Heat once again overhauled their roster, acquiring other veterans seeking a title such as Antoine Walker and Gary Payton.[33][34] Mourning continued to serve as the Heat's backup center, and early on stepped in to serve as the team's starting center after O'Neal suffered an injury. Mourning started in 20 games out of a total of 65 games played, averaging 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds, while finishing third in the league with 2.7 blocks per game despite playing as a reserve. In the playoffs, Mourning continued to shine in his role as a defensive player off the bench, as Miami advanced past the Bulls and the Nets before defeating the Pistons in six games to advance to the 2006 NBA Finals, the first NBA Finals in franchise history and the first for Mourning. After a 2–0 deficit, Miami won all three of its home games led by the spectacular play of Dwyane Wade, and in Game 6 in Dallas, Mourning came off the bench to score eight points with six rebounds and a team-high five blocks to help Miami win its first NBA championship in franchise history.\n\n\nAfter winning the championship, Mourning announced that he would return to the Heat in the 2006–07 season to defend their title, despite receiving offers of more money from other teams, including the San Antonio Spurs.[35] In 2007, Mourning announced he would return for one more year with the Heat and his 15th season. \"It will definitely be my last year\", Mourning said.[36] After starting the season on a solid note averaging 6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.75 blocks in just over 16 minutes played per 24 games,[37] Mourning tore his patellar tendon in his right knee[38] on December 19, 2007, during the first quarter of the 117–111 overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[39][40]\n\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, he became the Heat's all-time leader in points scored (which has since been surpassed by Dwyane Wade).[41]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nMourning announced his retirement from the NBA on January 22, 2009. In his press conference he said, \"At 38 I feel like I've physically done all I can for this game.\"[42][43] One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning's number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored.[3] The jersey retirement ceremony occurred on March 30, 2009, when the Heat hosted the Orlando Magic. During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor Charlie Crist; former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson; Basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing; Heat players Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem; and Heat head coach Pat Riley.[44][45]\n\n\nIn May 2009, he was named to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches, and administrators who contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia. In the following April, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding high school, collegiate, and professional career as well as his commitment to volunteer service in the communities in which he has lived and worked throughout his life.[46]\n\n\nMourning announced his return to the Heat in late June 2009; he holds the position of vice president of player programs and development, which covers community outreach and mentoring young players.[47]\n\n\nMourning played in a basketball game for Barack Obama's 50th birthday at the basketball court at the White House in 2011. In addition to Mourning, the game featured Shane Battier, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Maya Moore, Joakim Noah, Chris Paul and Derrick Rose and Obama's friends from high school. Kobe Bryant and Bill Russell were spectators.[48]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2014, it was announced that Mourning would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 8.[49][50][51]\n\n\nOn March 26, 2019, Mourning was named to the FIBA Hall of Fame,[52] and was inducted on August 30.[53][54]\n\n\nIn 2021, to commemorate the NBA's 75th anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all-time, and named Mourning as the 69th greatest player in NBA history.[55]\n\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* 3-time NBA champion: 2006 (as a player), 2012, 2013 (as vice president of player programs)\n* 7-time NBA All-Star: 1994–1997, 2000–2002\n* All-NBA First Team: 1999\n* All-NBA Second Team: 2000\n* 2-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year: 1999, 2000\n* 2-time NBA All-Defensive First Team: 1999, 2000\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team: 1993\n* J.

Funds are allocated toward research for a cure, education for doctors and the general public, testing for early detection and a fund for those not able to afford medication.\n\n\nIn 2007, Mourning along with Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, and Cal Ripken Jr. founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.[58]\n\n\nIn 2003, he also founded the Overtown Youth Center for underprivileged kids, located in Miami, Florida. The program aims to inspire, empower, and enrich these children while teaching them to become positive contributing citizens.\n\n\nIn 2009, the Miami-Dade school board named a new high school in North Miami, Florida, in his honor, Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMourning and his ex-wife Tracy have three children.[59] Like his father, his oldest son, Trey Mourning played for the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team, wearing his father's signature number 33 jersey. They resided in Pinecrest, Florida, where Mourning purchased a two-story, 9,786-square-foot residence for $4.5 million in 2012.[60] On June 26, 2019, Trey was included on the Miami Heat roster for the 2019 NBA Summer League,[61] and was later selected second overall by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA G League in the 2019 NBA G League draft.[62]\n\n\nIn July 2011, Mourning was sued by Miami-based lawyer Spencer Aronfeld on behalf of Alberto Candoleria for crashing his car into another car and then leaving the scene of the accident. The Florida Highway Patrol later charged Mourning with leaving the scene of a car accident. The accident allegedly occurred after he left Chris Bosh's wedding in Miami Beach after 3:00 a.m. Candoleria had just been in an accident when Mourning struck his car.[63][64][65]\n\n\nIn 2015, Mourning was one of eight Virginians honored in the Library of Virginia's \"Strong Men & Women in Virginia History\" for his charitable work and for his contributions to the sport of basketball.[66]\n\n\n\n### Kidney transplant[edit]\n\n\nOn November 25, 2003, Mourning's cousin and a retired U. S. Marine, Jason Cooper, was visiting Mourning's gravely ill grandmother in the hospital. Mourning's father was present and informed Cooper that Mourning was retiring that day from the NBA because of a life-threatening kidney disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the same problem that Sean Elliott had in 1999. Cooper asked if there was anything he could do, and began to contemplate donating one of his kidneys to his estranged cousin, whom he had not seen in 25 years and whom he only knew through basketball. Cooper was tested for compatibility, along with many other family members and friends (including fellow NBA center and good friend Patrick Ewing); during his grandmother's funeral, Mourning received the news that Jason Cooper was a match.[67][68]\n\n\nMourning received Cooper's left kidney on December 19, 2003.[66][68]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992–93 | Charlotte | 78 | **78** | 33.9 | .511 | .000 | .781 | 10.3 | 1.0 | .3 | 3.5 | 21.0\n |\n| 1993–94 | Charlotte | 60 | 59 | 33.6 | .505 | .000 | .762 | 10.2 | 1.4 | .5 | 3.1 | 21.5\n |\n| 1994–95 | Charlotte | 77 | 77 | **38.2** | .519 | .324 | .761 | 9.9 | 1.4 | .6 | 2.9 | 21.3\n |\n| 1995–96 | Miami | 70 | 70 | **38.2** | .523 | .300 | .685 | 10.4 | **2.3** | **1.0** | 2.7 | **23.2** |\n| 1996–97 | Miami | 66 | 65 | 35.2 | .534 | .111 | .642 | 9.9 | 1.6 | .8 | 2.9 | 19.8\n |\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 58 | 56 | 33.4 | .551 | .000 | .665 | 9.6 | .9 | .7 | 2.2 | 19.2\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 46 | 46 | 38.1 | .511 | .000 | .652 | **11.0** | 1.6 | .7 | **3.9\\*** | 20.1\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | **79** | **78** | 34.8 | .551 | .000 | .711 | 9.5 | 1.6 | .5 | 3.7\\* | 21.7\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 13 | 3 | 23.5 | .518 | .000 | .564 | 7.8 | .9 | .3 | 2.4 | 13.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Miami | 75 | 74 | 32.7 | .516 | **.333** | .657 | 8.4 | 1.2 | .4 | 2.5 | 15.7\n |\n| 2003–04 | New Jersey | 12 | 0 | 17.9 | .465 | .000 | **.882** | 2.3 | .7 | .2 | .5 | 8.0\n |\n| 2004–05 | New Jersey | 18 | 14 | 25.4 | .453 | .000 | .593 | 7.1 | .8 | .3 | 2.3 | 10.4\n |\n| 2004–05 | Miami | 19 | 3 | 12.9 | .516 | .000 | .564 | 3.7 | .2 | .2 | 1.7 | 5.0\n |\n| 2005–06†\n | Miami | 65 | 20 | 20.0 | **.597** | .000 | .594 | 5.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.7 | 7.8\n |\n| 2006–07 | Miami | 77 | 43 | 20.4 | .560 | .000 | .601 | 4.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.3 | 8.6\n |\n| 2007–08 | Miami | 25 | 0 | 15.6 | .547 | .000 | .592 | 3.7 | .3 | .2 | 1.7 | 6.0\n |\n| Career\n | 838 | 686 | 31.0 | .527 | .247 | .692 | 8.5 | 1.1 | .5 | 2.8 | 17.1\n |\n| All-Star\n | 4 | 1 | 18.8 | .545 | .000 | .667 | 4.8 | 1.0 | .8 | 2.0 | 10.0\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993 | Charlotte | 9 | 9 | 40.8 | .480 | .000 | .774 | 9.9 | 1.4 | .7 | **3.4** | **23.8** |\n| 1995 | Charlotte | 4 | 4 | **43.5** | .421 | **.500** | **.837** | **13.3** | **2.8** | .8 | 3.3\\* | 22.0\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 30.7 | .486 | .000 | .714 | 6.0 | 1.3 | .7 | 1.0 | 18.0\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | 17 | **17** | 37.1 | .491 | .375 | .555 | 10.2 | 1.1 | .6 | 2.7\\* | 17.8\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 4 | 4 | 34.5 | .518 | .000 | .655 | 8.5 | 1.3 | .8 | 2.5 | 19.3\n |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 38.8 | .521 | .000 | .653 | 8.2 | .8 | **1.6** | 2.8 | 21.6\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 10 | 10 | 37.6 | .484 | .000 | .667 | 10.0 | 1.4 | .2 | 3.3\\* | 21.6\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 30.3 | .480 | .000 | .579 | 5.3 | 1.0 | .0 | 1.7 | 11.7\n |\n| 2005 | Miami | 15 | 2 | 16.9 | .705 | .000 | .558 | 4.8 | .3 | .3 | 2.2 | 6.1\n |\n| 2006†\n | Miami | **21** | 0 | 10.8 | .703 | .000 | .667 | 2.9 | .1 | .2 | 1.1 | 3.8\n |\n| 2007 | Miami | 4 | 0 | 13.8 | **.909** | .000 | .385 | 2.0 | .3 | .0 | .8 | 6.3\n |\n| Career\n | 95 | 57 | 27.3 | .512 | .368 | .649 | 7.0 | .9 | .5 | 2.3 | 13.6\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Mourning to head player development\". *ESPN.com*.

Following his college basketball career at Georgetown University, his tenacity on defense twice earned him the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and twice placed him on the NBA All-Defensive Team. Mourning made a comeback after undergoing a kidney transplant and later won the 2006 NBA championship with the Heat. Mourning also played for the Charlotte Hornets and New Jersey Nets. On March 30, 2009, Mourning became the first Miami Heat player to have his number retired.[3] In 2010, Mourning was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In August 2014, Mourning was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and in August 2019 he was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDuring his time at Indian River High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, he led the team to 51 straight victories and a state title his junior year (1987). As a senior, he averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and 12 blocked shots per game. He was named Player of the Year by USA Today, Parade, Gatorade, and Naismith. He was the #1 recruit of the 1988 class, over Christian Laettner, Shawn Kemp, Billy Owens, Kenny Williams, Stanley Roberts, Rick Fox, and Malik Sealy, among others.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nMourning played college basketball for John Thompson at Georgetown University. He made an immediate impact as a freshman, starting all 34 games for the Hoyas, averaging 13.1 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. But his most notable accomplishment was leading the nation in total blocked shots (169) and blocks per game (5.0); both figures led the nation and set NCAA records for a freshman at that time.\n\n\nMourning's scoring and rebounding improved over the next two seasons, but his shot-blocking declined significantly, as his taller teammate Dikembe Mutombo established himself as starting center for Georgetown, forcing Mourning to play at power forward. After Mutombo entered the NBA draft in 1991, Mourning re-took his place as starting center, and responded with a spectacular senior season in 1991–92. He averaged 21.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 5.0 blocks per game that year, and collected numerous awards, including Consensus First-Team All-American and Big East Conference Player of the Year. He was also named Big East Defensive Player of the Year, which he had won twice previously (as a freshman in 1988–89, and again as a sophomore in 1989–90, sharing the award with Mutombo that season; Mutombo won the award alone in 1990–91).\n\n\nMourning finished his college career with 2,001 points and 1,032 rebounds, reaching the exclusive 2,000-point and 1,000-rebound milestone. More impressively, he finished with 453 blocked shots in his college career, ranking first all-time in NCAA history at that time. Interestingly, Mourning was never listed as the all-time leader in Georgetown history, as the school credits Patrick Ewing with 493 blocks during his college career,[4] but blocked shots were not an official NCAA statistic at that time.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Charlotte Hornets (1992–1995)[edit]\n\n\nMourning was selected second overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, behind Shaquille O'Neal and before Christian Laettner.[5] Mourning was named to the league's all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks. He finished second to Shaquille O'Neal in rookie of the year voting.[6] He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since David Robinson in the 1989–90 season to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104–103 victory in the game and a 3–1 victory in the series. The Hornets lost in the second round to the New York Knicks in five games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in nine playoff games. The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.\n\n\nIn the 1994–95 season, Mourning and teammate Larry Johnson led the Hornets to a 50-win season and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in scoring (21.3 per game), rebounding (9.9 per game), blocked shots (2.92 per game), and field goal percentage (.519), and played in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1995–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn November 3, 1995, after Mourning rejected Charlotte's contract extension offer worth an average of $11.2 million for seven years and knowing they would not be able to re-sign him, the Hornets traded him, along with reserves Pete Myers and LeRon Ellis in exchange for Glen Rice, Matt Geiger, Khalid Reeves and a first-round pick in the 1996 NBA draft.[7]\n\n\nMourning would immediately serve as the centerpiece of the Pat Riley-coached Heat, and in his first season in Miami he averaged 23.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game as Miami made the playoffs before being swept in the first round by the 72-win Bulls. Mourning played in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game and was joined by All-Star point guard Tim Hardaway who arrived through a mid-season trade.\n\n\nIn July 1996, Mourning signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Heat.[8] In the 1996–97 season, the Heat would go on to win a then franchise-record 61 games, finishing second in the Eastern Conference behind the defending champions Bulls, while Mourning averaged 19.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the Orlando Magic in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where the rivalry between the Heat and the New York Knicks intensified. The Knicks took a 3–1 series lead, but following a brawl between Charlie Ward and P. J. Brown late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down. Mourning scored 28 points in Game 6, followed by a 22-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 to help Miami advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, a franchise first, to face Chicago. The Bulls took a 3–0 series lead, and Mourning guaranteed a victory in Game 4 as the Heat won 87–80.[9] However, with a 100–87 loss in Game 5, the Heat were eliminated by the Bulls.\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Mourning played 58 games and averaged 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game as the Heat won 55 games. However, Miami lost in the first round to the Knicks, with Mourning missing the deciding Game 5 due to a suspension caused by a fight between Mourning and former teammate Larry Johnson in Game 4.[10] The brawl also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was seen dangling on Mourning's leg in an attempt to break up the fight.[11] The following season, the Heat won 31 games in a lockout-shortened 50-game schedule, and Mourning won his first of two consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards after leading the league in blocks with 3.9 per game. Despite finishing with the best record in the Eastern Conference, the Heat once again fell short to the Knicks in the first round, with Allan Houston securing the series victory with a last-second jumper in Game 5.[12][13] Mourning again led the NBA in blocks in the 1999–2000 season, this time with a 3.7 average, and won Defensive Player of the Year. Miami finished the regular season with 52 wins and faced the Knicks in the second round. But for a third straight season, the Heat lost to the Knicks in a winner-take-all game, this time in Game 7.[14]\n\n\nShortly after playing for the gold medal-winning U.S. national team in the 2000 Summer Olympics, Mourning was diagnosed with a serious kidney disease.[15] Initially deemed out for the remainder of the season, Mourning returned for the final 13 games, helping the Heat win 50 games despite playing limited minutes. However, Miami was swept 3–0 in the first round by the Hornets.[16] In the 2001–02 season, Mourning played 75 games and averaged 15.7 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game, earning his final All-Star nod. Despite that, the Heat missed the playoffs with a 36–46 record. Mourning missed the entire 2002–03 season as he continued to deal with a serious kidney disorder, and without their star center, the Heat won only 25 games and missed the playoffs again.[17]\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nMourning signed a four-year deal with the New Jersey Nets in July 2003 as a free agent.[18][19] On November 24, 2003, after appearing in 12 games, Mourning retired from the NBA due to complications from his kidney disease.[20][21] On December 19, he underwent a successful kidney transplant.[22] In 2004, he started practicing with the Nets again, and made the team's regular season roster during the 2004–05 season. He did not play a significant role with the Nets, however, and openly complained to the media that he wanted out of New Jersey, especially after the team traded away Kenyon Martin.[23][24] After playing in just 30 total games for New Jersey, Mourning, Eric Williams and Aaron Williams were traded to the Toronto Raptors for Vince Carter on December 17, 2004.[25][26] Mourning never reported to the Raptors, and was bought out of his contract at a remaining $9 million on February 11, 2005. Raptors team officials later said that he did not meet the medical conditions to play for the team.[27][28][29] Mourning then finished the season with the Heat being paid a second salary, the veteran's minimum.[30]\n\n\n\n### Return to the Heat (2005–2008)[edit]\n\n\nMourning re-signed with the Heat on March 1, 2005.[31] His role was reduced as a backup because of superstar Shaquille O'Neal, although he was called upon as a starter due to O'Neal missing stretches due to injury. O'Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning's tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the first seed in Eastern Conference during the 2004–05 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest. Miami swept the Nets in the first round of the playoffs, with Mourning recording 21 points and nine rebounds in just 16 minutes in Game 2. In the second round against the Washington Wizards, Mourning stepped in for the injured O'Neal and scored 14 points with 13 rebounds and blocked four shots in Game 3 as Miami completed another four-game sweep. Miami fell in seven games to the defending champions, the Detroit Pistons, in the Eastern Conference Finals, with Mourning leading the team in blocks with three per game for the series.\n\n\nOn June 17, 2005, the Heat picked up the team option on Mourning,[32] as the Heat once again overhauled their roster, acquiring other veterans seeking a title such as Antoine Walker and Gary Payton.[33][34] Mourning continued to serve as the Heat's backup center, and early on stepped in to serve as the team's starting center after O'Neal suffered an injury. Mourning started in 20 games out of a total of 65 games played, averaging 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds, while finishing third in the league with 2.7 blocks per game despite playing as a reserve. In the playoffs, Mourning continued to shine in his role as a defensive player off the bench, as Miami advanced past the Bulls and the Nets before defeating the Pistons in six games to advance to the 2006 NBA Finals, the first NBA Finals in franchise history and the first for Mourning. After a 2–0 deficit, Miami won all three of its home games led by the spectacular play of Dwyane Wade, and in Game 6 in Dallas, Mourning came off the bench to score eight points with six rebounds and a team-high five blocks to help Miami win its first NBA championship in franchise history.\n\n\nAfter winning the championship, Mourning announced that he would return to the Heat in the 2006–07 season to defend their title, despite receiving offers of more money from other teams, including the San Antonio Spurs.[35] In 2007, Mourning announced he would return for one more year with the Heat and his 15th season. \"It will definitely be my last year\", Mourning said.[36] After starting the season on a solid note averaging 6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.75 blocks in just over 16 minutes played per 24 games,[37] Mourning tore his patellar tendon in his right knee[38] on December 19, 2007, during the first quarter of the 117–111 overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[39][40]\n\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, he became the Heat's all-time leader in points scored (which has since been surpassed by Dwyane Wade).[41]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nMourning announced his retirement from the NBA on January 22, 2009. In his press conference he said, \"At 38 I feel like I've physically done all I can for this game.\"[42][43] One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning's number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored.[3] The jersey retirement ceremony occurred on March 30, 2009, when the Heat hosted the Orlando Magic. During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor Charlie Crist; former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson; Basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing; Heat players Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem; and Heat head coach Pat Riley.[44][45]\n\n\nIn May 2009, he was named to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches, and administrators who contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia. In the following April, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding high school, collegiate, and professional career as well as his commitment to volunteer service in the communities in which he has lived and worked throughout his life.[46]\n\n\nMourning announced his return to the Heat in late June 2009; he holds the position of vice president of player programs and development, which covers community outreach and mentoring young players.[47]\n\n\nMourning played in a basketball game for Barack Obama's 50th birthday at the basketball court at the White House in 2011. In addition to Mourning, the game featured Shane Battier, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Maya Moore, Joakim Noah, Chris Paul and Derrick Rose and Obama's friends from high school. Kobe Bryant and Bill Russell were spectators.[48]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2014, it was announced that Mourning would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 8.[49][50][51]\n\n\nOn March 26, 2019, Mourning was named to the FIBA Hall of Fame,[52] and was inducted on August 30.[53][54]\n\n\nIn 2021, to commemorate the NBA's 75th anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all-time, and named Mourning as the 69th greatest player in NBA history.[55]\n\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* 3-time NBA champion: 2006 (as a player), 2012, 2013 (as vice president of player programs)\n* 7-time NBA All-Star: 1994–1997, 2000–2002\n* All-NBA First Team: 1999\n* All-NBA Second Team: 2000\n* 2-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year: 1999, 2000\n* 2-time NBA All-Defensive First Team: 1999, 2000\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team: 1993\n* J.

Funds are allocated toward research for a cure, education for doctors and the general public, testing for early detection and a fund for those not able to afford medication.\n\n\nIn 2007, Mourning along with Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, and Cal Ripken Jr. founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.[58]\n\n\nIn 2003, he also founded the Overtown Youth Center for underprivileged kids, located in Miami, Florida. The program aims to inspire, empower, and enrich these children while teaching them to become positive contributing citizens.\n\n\nIn 2009, the Miami-Dade school board named a new high school in North Miami, Florida, in his honor, Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMourning and his ex-wife Tracy have three children.[59] Like his father, his oldest son, Trey Mourning played for the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team, wearing his father's signature number 33 jersey. They resided in Pinecrest, Florida, where Mourning purchased a two-story, 9,786-square-foot residence for $4.5 million in 2012.[60] On June 26, 2019, Trey was included on the Miami Heat roster for the 2019 NBA Summer League,[61] and was later selected second overall by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA G League in the 2019 NBA G League draft.[62]\n\n\nIn July 2011, Mourning was sued by Miami-based lawyer Spencer Aronfeld on behalf of Alberto Candoleria for crashing his car into another car and then leaving the scene of the accident. The Florida Highway Patrol later charged Mourning with leaving the scene of a car accident. The accident allegedly occurred after he left Chris Bosh's wedding in Miami Beach after 3:00 a.m. Candoleria had just been in an accident when Mourning struck his car.[63][64][65]\n\n\nIn 2015, Mourning was one of eight Virginians honored in the Library of Virginia's \"Strong Men & Women in Virginia History\" for his charitable work and for his contributions to the sport of basketball.[66]\n\n\n\n### Kidney transplant[edit]\n\n\nOn November 25, 2003, Mourning's cousin and a retired U. S. Marine, Jason Cooper, was visiting Mourning's gravely ill grandmother in the hospital. Mourning's father was present and informed Cooper that Mourning was retiring that day from the NBA because of a life-threatening kidney disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the same problem that Sean Elliott had in 1999. Cooper asked if there was anything he could do, and began to contemplate donating one of his kidneys to his estranged cousin, whom he had not seen in 25 years and whom he only knew through basketball. Cooper was tested for compatibility, along with many other family members and friends (including fellow NBA center and good friend Patrick Ewing); during his grandmother's funeral, Mourning received the news that Jason Cooper was a match.[67][68]\n\n\nMourning received Cooper's left kidney on December 19, 2003.[66][68]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992–93 | Charlotte | 78 | **78** | 33.9 | .511 | .000 | .781 | 10.3 | 1.0 | .3 | 3.5 | 21.0\n |\n| 1993–94 | Charlotte | 60 | 59 | 33.6 | .505 | .000 | .762 | 10.2 | 1.4 | .5 | 3.1 | 21.5\n |\n| 1994–95 | Charlotte | 77 | 77 | **38.2** | .519 | .324 | .761 | 9.9 | 1.4 | .6 | 2.9 | 21.3\n |\n| 1995–96 | Miami | 70 | 70 | **38.2** | .523 | .300 | .685 | 10.4 | **2.3** | **1.0** | 2.7 | **23.2** |\n| 1996–97 | Miami | 66 | 65 | 35.2 | .534 | .111 | .642 | 9.9 | 1.6 | .8 | 2.9 | 19.8\n |\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 58 | 56 | 33.4 | .551 | .000 | .665 | 9.6 | .9 | .7 | 2.2 | 19.2\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 46 | 46 | 38.1 | .511 | .000 | .652 | **11.0** | 1.6 | .7 | **3.9\\*** | 20.1\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | **79** | **78** | 34.8 | .551 | .000 | .711 | 9.5 | 1.6 | .5 | 3.7\\* | 21.7\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 13 | 3 | 23.5 | .518 | .000 | .564 | 7.8 | .9 | .3 | 2.4 | 13.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Miami | 75 | 74 | 32.7 | .516 | **.333** | .657 | 8.4 | 1.2 | .4 | 2.5 | 15.7\n |\n| 2003–04 | New Jersey | 12 | 0 | 17.9 | .465 | .000 | **.882** | 2.3 | .7 | .2 | .5 | 8.0\n |\n| 2004–05 | New Jersey | 18 | 14 | 25.4 | .453 | .000 | .593 | 7.1 | .8 | .3 | 2.3 | 10.4\n |\n| 2004–05 | Miami | 19 | 3 | 12.9 | .516 | .000 | .564 | 3.7 | .2 | .2 | 1.7 | 5.0\n |\n| 2005–06†\n | Miami | 65 | 20 | 20.0 | **.597** | .000 | .594 | 5.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.7 | 7.8\n |\n| 2006–07 | Miami | 77 | 43 | 20.4 | .560 | .000 | .601 | 4.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.3 | 8.6\n |\n| 2007–08 | Miami | 25 | 0 | 15.6 | .547 | .000 | .592 | 3.7 | .3 | .2 | 1.7 | 6.0\n |\n| Career\n | 838 | 686 | 31.0 | .527 | .247 | .692 | 8.5 | 1.1 | .5 | 2.8 | 17.1\n |\n| All-Star\n | 4 | 1 | 18.8 | .545 | .000 | .667 | 4.8 | 1.0 | .8 | 2.0 | 10.0\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993 | Charlotte | 9 | 9 | 40.8 | .480 | .000 | .774 | 9.9 | 1.4 | .7 | **3.4** | **23.8** |\n| 1995 | Charlotte | 4 | 4 | **43.5** | .421 | **.500** | **.837** | **13.3** | **2.8** | .8 | 3.3\\* | 22.0\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 30.7 | .486 | .000 | .714 | 6.0 | 1.3 | .7 | 1.0 | 18.0\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | 17 | **17** | 37.1 | .491 | .375 | .555 | 10.2 | 1.1 | .6 | 2.7\\* | 17.8\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 4 | 4 | 34.5 | .518 | .000 | .655 | 8.5 | 1.3 | .8 | 2.5 | 19.3\n |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 38.8 | .521 | .000 | .653 | 8.2 | .8 | **1.6** | 2.8 | 21.6\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 10 | 10 | 37.6 | .484 | .000 | .667 | 10.0 | 1.4 | .2 | 3.3\\* | 21.6\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 30.3 | .480 | .000 | .579 | 5.3 | 1.0 | .0 | 1.7 | 11.7\n |\n| 2005 | Miami | 15 | 2 | 16.9 | .705 | .000 | .558 | 4.8 | .3 | .3 | 2.2 | 6.1\n |\n| 2006†\n | Miami | **21** | 0 | 10.8 | .703 | .000 | .667 | 2.9 | .1 | .2 | 1.1 | 3.8\n |\n| 2007 | Miami | 4 | 0 | 13.8 | **.909** | .000 | .385 | 2.0 | .3 | .0 | .8 | 6.3\n |\n| Career\n | 95 | 57 | 27.3 | .512 | .368 | .649 | 7.0 | .9 | .5 | 2.3 | 13.6\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Mourning to head player development\". *ESPN.com*.
