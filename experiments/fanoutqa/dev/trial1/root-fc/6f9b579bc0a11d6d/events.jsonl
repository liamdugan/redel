The capacity figures are for each stadium's permanent total capacity, including seating and any official standing areas. The capacity does include movable seating – used by multi-purpose stadiums to regularly convert the stadium for different sports, and retractable seating for safe standing, but excludes any temporary seating or standing, such as for concerts.
