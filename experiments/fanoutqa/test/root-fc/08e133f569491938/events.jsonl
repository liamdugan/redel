Alcaraz has won twelve ATP Tour-level singles titles, including two major titles (at the 2022 US Open and 2023 Wimbledon Championships) and four Masters 1000 titles. Following his win at the 2022 US Open, Alcaraz became the youngest man and the first teenager in the Open Era to top the singles rankings, at 19 years, 4 months, and 6 days old.[5][6][7]\n\n\n\nAs a junior, Alcaraz was ranked as high as world No. 22 and won two titles on the ITF Junior Circuit. After turning professional in 2018, he won three titles on the ITF Men's World Tennis Tour and four on the ATP Challenger Tour and broke into the top 100 in rankings in May 2021. Two months later, Alcaraz won his first ATP title at the Croatia Open, an ATP 250 tournament. He later entered the top 50 after reaching the quarterfinals at the following US Open and won the year end Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan. After winning his first ATP 500 title at the Rio Open in February 2022, Alcaraz won his first Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open and his second ATP 500 title at the Barcelona Open in April, propelling him into the top 10. In September 2022, Alcaraz defeated Casper Ruud in the US Open final to win his first major singles title. In May 2023, he was awarded the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year award. In July 2023, Alcaraz won Wimbledon, defeating seven-time and defending champion Novak Djokovic in the final to claim his second major singles title. \n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nCarlos Alcaraz Garfia was born on 5 May 2003, in El Palmar, Murcia, Spain, to parents Carlos Alcaraz González and Virginia Garfia Escandón. He has three siblings.\n\n\nAlcaraz started playing tennis at the age of four at the Real Sociedad Club de Campo de Murcia (Royal Society Murciashire Club), where his father was the tennis academy director. Alcaraz' father was a former professional player, but stopped playing when he couldn't afford to any longer. In 2018, he moved to Villena to begin training at Juan Carlos Ferrero's Equelite JC Ferrero Sport Academy.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2020: ATP debut[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, at the age of 16, Alcaraz made his ATP main-draw debut at the Rio Open after receiving a wildcard for the singles main draw. There, he defeated Albert Ramos Viñolas.[10] Alcaraz was defeated in the second round by Federico Coria.\n\n\n\n### 2021: First title, Next-Gen Finals champion, top 35[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2021 French Open\nAt age 17, Alcaraz made it to the main draw of the Australian Open, making him the youngest participant in the men's singles.[11] He won his Grand Slam tournament debut defeating fellow qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp in straight sets before losing in the second round to Mikael Ymer.[12]\n\n\nAlcaraz became the youngest match winner in the Madrid Open's history, defeating Adrian Mannarino as a wildcard and breaking then-18-year-old Rafael Nadal's record from 2004. In the second round, he lost to five-time champion Nadal on Alcaraz's 18th birthday.[13][14][15]\nBy winning the biggest title of his career until then at the 2021 Open de Oeiras III Challenger tournament, he entered the top 100 as the youngest player at the age of 18 on 24 May 2021.[16][17]\n\n\nAt the French Open, Alcaraz reached the third round of a major for the first time in his career by defeating Nikoloz Basilashvili.\n\n\nIn July 2021, he reached his first ATP final at the 2021 Croatia Open Umag, defeating top seed Albert Ramos Viñolas.[18] He then won his maiden ATP title by defeating Richard Gasquet and becoming the youngest tour-level champion since 18-year-old Kei Nishikori won the Delray Beach Open in 2008. Alcaraz was the youngest Spaniard to win an ATP Tour title since Nadal claimed his first trophy in Sopot in 2004.[19]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, he lost in the second round to Daniil Medvedev. At the Winston-Salem Open, Alcaraz reached the round of 16 defeating qualifier Alexei Popyrin, and his second tour-level quarterfinal of the season defeating fourth seed Márton Fucsovics.[20] He defeated Marcos Giron to reach the semifinals,[21] where he lost to Mikael Ymer.\n\n\nAt the US Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas in a fifth-set tiebreak to reach the fourth round in the biggest win of his career.[22] At 18 years of age, Alcaraz became the youngest man in a major fourth round since 17-year-old Andrei Medvedev at the 1992 French Open, and the youngest man in the US Open fourth round since 17-year-old Michael Chang and 18-year-old Pete Sampras in 1989.[23][24] He then reached the quarterfinals by defeating qualifier Peter Gojowczyk. Alcaraz became the youngest US Open men's quarterfinalist in the Open Era, the youngest at the tournament since 18-year-old Thomaz Koch in 1963, and the youngest Grand Slam tournament men's singles quarterfinalist since 18-year-old Michael Chang at the 1990 French Open. He then lost to Félix Auger-Aliassime via retirement in the second set in the quarterfinals after injuring his leg.[25]\n\n\nAt the Erste Bank Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 7 Matteo Berrettini, his second win over a top-10 player,[26] and became the youngest player in the top 35 on 1 November. During his Paris Masters run, Alcaraz defeated French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert in three thrilling sets in the first round.[27] He then defeated Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the second round, his third win over a top-10 player.[28] In the third round, he was defeated by Hugo Gaston in straight sets.[29]\n\n\nAt the Next Gen ATP Finals, Alcaraz defeated Brandon Nakashima, Juan Manuel Cerúndolo, and Holger Rune in the round-robin stage. He beat Sebastian Baez in the semifinal, and Sebastian Korda in the final.[30][31][32][33]\n\n\n\n### 2022: First major, youngest world No. 1, and year-end No. 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\nSeeded for the first time in a major at No. 31, Alcaraz reached the third round of the Australian Open before losing in five sets to Matteo Berrettini.[34]\n\n\nSeeded seventh at the Rio Open, Alcaraz won his first ATP 500 title by defeating Diego Schwartzman in the final.[35] He entered the top 20 in the singles rankings on 21 February 2022. In Indian Wells, Alcaraz reached his first Masters 1000 quarterfinal and semifinal, defeating defending champion Cameron Norrie before losing to Rafael Nadal.\n\n\nSeeded 14th at the Miami Open, Alcaraz defeated 6th seed Casper Ruud to win his first Masters 1000 title, the youngest men's champion in the tournament's history and the third-youngest ATP Masters 1000 titlist in history.[36]\n\n\nAt the Monte-Carlo Masters, Alcaraz lost in the second round to Sebastian Korda.[37] At the Barcelona Open, Alcaraz defeated top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals[38] to enter the top 10 in rankings for the first time on 25 April.[39][40] He became the 20th teen to break into top 10 overall since rankings were established in 1973, and the youngest since Rafael Nadal also on 25 April 2005.[41][42] Alcaraz later defeated Pablo Carreño Busta to win the title.[43]\n\n\nA day after his 19th birthday at the Madrid Open, he defeated 5-time Madrid champion, world No. 4 and third seed Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals to become the first teenager to defeat him on clay.[44] The following day, he beat the world No. 1 and top seed Novak Djokovic in the semifinals for his 6th straight top-10 win, and became the youngest player to win a match against a world No. 1 since 2004. He also became the first player to ever beat Djokovic and Nadal back-to-back on clay.[36][45][46] In the final, he won his fourth title for the season (and second Masters 1000), by defeating defending champion and world No. 3 Alexander Zverev, thereby defeating the top three seeds in three consecutive matches. He also became the youngest champion in tournament history.[47] As a result, he climbed to a career-high of world No. 6 in the rankings on 9 May 2022.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships\nFollowing his withdrawal from the Italian Open due to an ankle injury,[49] Alcaraz made his seeded debut at the French Open as No. 6. Having won two of the tour's biggest titles on clay coming into the Slam, he was widely projected to be one of the favorites for the title.[50] He defeated Juan Ignacio Londero in straight sets before saving a match point in a second round five-setter against Albert Ramos Viñolas.[51][52] He then defeated Korda and Karen Khachanov in straight sets before losing to Zverev, in the second major quarterfinal of his career.[53][54][55]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, Alcaraz beat Jan-Lennard Struff in a close five set match before defeating Tallon Griekspoor and Oscar Otte in straight sets, reaching the round of 16 for the first time at this major. He lost to Jannik Sinner in the fourth round.\n\n\nAt the Hamburg Open, he reached the final, resulting in a new career-high of world No. 5 on 25 July 2022. Alcaraz became the youngest player to enter the top 5 in rankings since Nadal in 2005.[56][57] He was defeated in the final by Lorenzo Musetti, resulting in the first loss in a tournament final of his career.[58] At the Croatia Open, he reached his second consecutive final, resulting in another ranking jump to world No. 4 on 1 August.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Evolution of Carlos Alcaraz compared to the \"Big Three\" in the ATP RANKING from 17 to 20 years old, on the left the starting ranking and the names of the players can be seen, and the highest ranking reached in the period are on the right.\nAlcaraz entered the 2022 US Open as the No. 3 seed.[61] He defeated Sebastian Baez, Federico Coria and Jenson Brooksby without dropping a set to reach the fourth round.[62] Next he defeated 15th seed Marin Čilić in five sets, becoming the youngest man to reach back-to-back quarterfinals at this Major in the Open Era.[63] In his quarterfinal match he defeated Jannik Sinner, saving a match point in the fourth set. The match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50AM EST) and second longest match (5 hours and 15 minutes) in US Open history.[64][65] He defeated Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals for his third consecutive five-set match victory.[66] He defeated 5th seed Casper Ruud in the final, where both players were in contention for the world No. 1 ranking, to win the title. Alcaraz became the youngest No. 1 in the history of the ATP Rankings at the age of 19 years, 4 months and 6 days, breaking Lleyton Hewitt's record.[5] He also became the first teenager in the Open Era to top the men's rankings and the youngest men's US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990.[67]\n\n\nIn his first match as world No. 1, Alcaraz lost his singles match at the 2022 Davis Cup Finals to Félix Auger-Aliassime.[68] Next, he lost to David Goffin at the Astana Open in his opening round. Alcaraz reached the semifinals in Basel, where he was defeated by the eventual champion Auger-Aliassime for a second time in the season.[69] At the Paris Masters, Alcaraz reached the quarterfinals after defeating Yoshihito Nishioka and Grigor Dimitrov, but retired while being a set down against Holger Rune.[70] A day later, Alcaraz announced he had suffered an abdominal tear requiring a six-week layoff, forcing him to end his season early. Alcaraz withdrew from the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup Finals.[71] Alcaraz, at the age of 19 years and 214 days, ended the year as youngest and first teenager world No. 1.[7]\n\n\n\n### 2023: 100th career win and Wimbledon champion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2023 French OpenOn 7 January, Alcaraz announced his withdrawal from the Australian Open due to a hamstring injury he suffered in his right leg while training.[72] Following the tournament, he lost the world No. 1 ranking to the champion Novak Djokovic.[73] He held the ranking for a total of 20 weeks.\n\n\nIn his first tournament for the 2023 season at the Golden Swing in South America, Alcaraz won his seventh title at the Argentina Open, defeating second seed Cameron Norrie.[74] Defending his title at the Rio Open, he reached back to back finals where he played against Norrie again, but lost in three sets.[75] Alcaraz was additionally scheduled to play in Acapulco in the month of February, but withdrew prior to the tournament after suffering another hamstring injury.[76]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Open he recorded his 100th career win, defeating 31st seed Tallon Griekspoor to reach the fourth round, making him the second fastest player to reach this milestone after John McEnroe, and faster than the Big 3.[77][36] After reaching the semifinals, Alcaraz defeated eleventh seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets in an anticipated match.[78][79] Defeating fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, he won his eighth career title and third Masters 1000 title, breaking Medvedev's 19-match winning streak, and becoming the first player to win the tournament without dropping a set since Roger Federer in 2017. He additionally became the ninth and youngest man to win both legs of the Sunshine Double. As a result, he returned to world No. 1 on 20 March 2023.[80] \nIn Miami where Alcaraz was the defending champion, he reached the semifinals having not dropped a set defeating Facundo Bagnis, Dušan Lajović, 16th seed Tommy Paul and ninth seed Taylor Fritz. This time he lost to Jannik Sinner in three sets.[81] He dropped to No. 2 in the rankings having not been able to defend his previous year title points.[82]\n\n\nAlcaraz was scheduled to play at the Monte-Carlo Masters the following week, but withdrew due to post-traumatic arthritis in his left hand and muscular discomfort in his spine.[83] He began the European clay court swing at the Barcelona Open; defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, he successfully defended his title without dropping a set.[84] He won his tenth career title at the Madrid Open again as the defending champion, defeating lucky loser Jan-Lennard Struff.[85] At the next clay court tournament, the Rome Masters, Alcaraz earned the opportunity to clinch the No. 1 ranking just by playing his second round match. Following his victory, he regained the top ranking from Novak Djokovic. However, he was upset in the next round by the world No. 135 Fabian Marozsan in straight sets, in what Jon Wertheim labelled the biggest upset of the year.[86][87]\n\n\nAt the 2023 French Open, Alcaraz advanced to the semifinals. In a highly anticipated match, he was defeated by Novak Djokovic in four sets, after suffering cramps at the onset of the third. Alcaraz and Djokovic had not played against each other in over a year, despite alternating between the world No. 1 ranking throughout 2023; Alcaraz would later claim the nerves of the occasion had partially led to his cramping. Djokovic regained the No. 1 ranking from Alcaraz, after he ultimately went on to win the tournament.[88][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2023 Carlos Alcaraz won his first Wimbledon title. At the Queen's Club Championships, he recorded his first title on grass in only his third career grass court tournament, beating Alex de Minaur in the final. The tournament win in London also returned him to the world No. 1 in rankings.[90] At the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, as the top seed, he reached the final following wins over Jérémy Chardy, Alexandre Müller, Nicolas Jarry, Matteo Berrettini, Holger Rune, and Daniil Medvedev. In a monumental match, Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in five sets, ending Djokovic's run to win a fifth consecutive title, and securing the No. 1 ranking. With this win, Alcaraz became the second player, after Andy Murray, to defeat Djokovic in a Wimbledon final.[91] Additionally, Alcaraz became the first non-\"Big 4\" player to win Wimbledon since Lleyton Hewitt's victory in 2002.[92]\n\n\nAlcaraz lost to Djokovic in a rematch of their Wimbledon final at the Cincinnati final. He lost in three sets, despite winning the first set, being 4–2 up in the second set, and having a championship point in the second-set tiebreak. It was the longest ever best-of-three-sets ATP Masters final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes.[93] At the 2023 US Open, where Alcaraz was looking to defend his grand slam title, he reached the semifinals having only dropped one set. However, he lost to 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev in four sets.[94] Alcaraz dropped to No. 2 in the rankings following the tournament, as Novak Djokovic was not defending any points.[95]\n\n\nAlcaraz entered the year-end indoor hardcourt season with the goal of gaining the year-end No. 1 ranking.[96][97] However, in the Asian swing, he lost to Jannik Sinner in the semifinals of Beijing for a second time in the season, and then to Grigor Dimitrov in the round of 16 at Shanghai.[98][99] He then withdrew from Basel due to injury,[100] and lost in his opening round at the Paris-Bercy Masters to Roman Safiullin.[101][102] His final tournament of the year will be the ATP Finals in Turin.[*citation needed*] Despite qualification for the 2023 ATP Next Generation Finals, he is expected not to play in said tournament.[103]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is sponsored by Nike for clothing and shoes, and by Babolat for racquets, using the Babolat Pure Aero 98 racquet.[104][105] In January 2022, he became a brand ambassador for Rolex.[106][107] He is also a brand ambassador for dermocosmetics company Isdin, Spanish food company ElPozo, and German automobile manufacturer BMW under their BMW Spain division.[108][109][110] In January 2023, he became ambassador for the American clothing brand Calvin Klein especially for their 1996 underwear campaign.[111] In June 2023, Alcaraz became a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton.[112]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is an all-court, all-round tennis player, but primarily employs an aggressive baseline style of play, with an emphasis on a high winner count from his forehand, typically his most reliable and potent shot. He can either hit his forehand flat and fast for winners from every court position, or add a great amount of topspin and margin over the net. He also possesses a well-rounded and more flat and lower net-clearance backhand groundstroke that he is able to redirect down the line for clean winners. His greatly disguised drop shot is key to his game, as he often combines the heaviness of his groundstrokes that pushes his opponents back into the court into a defensive position, with a drop shot that is often too well-placed and disguised to deal with. He has an impressive net-game with great drop volleys and drive volleys, and frequently serves-and-volleys on crucial points.[113]\n\n\nAlcaraz has a strong first serve for his mid-sized frame which is commonly around 115 to 120 mph and hit with average placement.[114] Alcaraz has a reliable second serve to which he can add topspin, in order to get a high bounce off the court and either push back or get a weak return from closer-returning opponents. This serve typically reaches 150 to 170 km/h (93 to 106 mph).[115]\n\n\nAlcaraz has earned acclaim for his athletic and physical traits. In particular, his direct sprints, counterattacking abilities, and an extremely high peak footspeed have garnered him comparisons to a young Rafael Nadal. He has been compared to Novak Djokovic for his assured lateral movement and court-coverage aided by physical splits and sliding through the court on defense, particularly on his backhand side where he is often able to neutralize his opponent's groundstroke aggression or drop shot attempts. Court coverage and exceptional touch have also been crucial in his success.[*citation needed*] In particular he is known for his frequent use of the drop shot.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Carlos Alcaraz career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 3R | A\n |  | 0 / 2\n | 3–2\n | 60%\n |\n| French Open | Q1 | 3R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 11–3\n | 79%\n |\n| Wimbledon | NH\n | 2R | 4R | **W** |  | 1 / 3\n | 11–2\n | 85%\n |\n| US Open | A\n | QF | **W** | SF |  | 1 / 3\n | 16–2\n | 89%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 8–4\n | 16–3\n | 17–2\n |  | 2 / 11\n | 41–9\n | 82%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 titles)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win | 2022 | US Open | Hard | ![Norway](image) Casper Ruud | 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–1), 6–3\n |\n| Win | 2023 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 1–6, 7–6(8–6), 6–1, 3–6, 6–4 |\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n#### Open Era records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Miami Open – 18 years, 11 months[116] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Madrid Open – 19 years[117] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to become ATP world No. 1 – 19 years, 4 months[118] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest year-end No. 1 – 19 years, 5 months[119] | **Stands alone** |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* ATP Newcomer of the Year (2020)\n* ATP Player of the Year (2022)\n* ATP Most Improved Player (2022)\n* Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year (2023)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players (since 1973)\n* Top ten ranked male tennis players\n* List of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n* World number 1 ranked male tennis players (all time, based on recognized tennis authorities)\n* ATP Awards\n* Tennis in Spain\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In ATP Tour and Grand Slam main draw matches, Summer Olympics, Davis Cup and Laver Cup\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Carlos Alcaraz | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

Alcaraz has won twelve ATP Tour-level singles titles, including two major titles (at the 2022 US Open and 2023 Wimbledon Championships) and four Masters 1000 titles. Following his win at the 2022 US Open, Alcaraz became the youngest man and the first teenager in the Open Era to top the singles rankings, at 19 years, 4 months, and 6 days old.[5][6][7]\n\n\n\nAs a junior, Alcaraz was ranked as high as world No. 22 and won two titles on the ITF Junior Circuit. After turning professional in 2018, he won three titles on the ITF Men's World Tennis Tour and four on the ATP Challenger Tour and broke into the top 100 in rankings in May 2021. Two months later, Alcaraz won his first ATP title at the Croatia Open, an ATP 250 tournament. He later entered the top 50 after reaching the quarterfinals at the following US Open and won the year end Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan. After winning his first ATP 500 title at the Rio Open in February 2022, Alcaraz won his first Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open and his second ATP 500 title at the Barcelona Open in April, propelling him into the top 10. In September 2022, Alcaraz defeated Casper Ruud in the US Open final to win his first major singles title. In May 2023, he was awarded the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year award. In July 2023, Alcaraz won Wimbledon, defeating seven-time and defending champion Novak Djokovic in the final to claim his second major singles title. \n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nCarlos Alcaraz Garfia was born on 5 May 2003, in El Palmar, Murcia, Spain, to parents Carlos Alcaraz González and Virginia Garfia Escandón. He has three siblings.\n\n\nAlcaraz started playing tennis at the age of four at the Real Sociedad Club de Campo de Murcia (Royal Society Murciashire Club), where his father was the tennis academy director. Alcaraz' father was a former professional player, but stopped playing when he couldn't afford to any longer. In 2018, he moved to Villena to begin training at Juan Carlos Ferrero's Equelite JC Ferrero Sport Academy.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2020: ATP debut[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, at the age of 16, Alcaraz made his ATP main-draw debut at the Rio Open after receiving a wildcard for the singles main draw. There, he defeated Albert Ramos Viñolas.[10] Alcaraz was defeated in the second round by Federico Coria.\n\n\n\n### 2021: First title, Next-Gen Finals champion, top 35[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2021 French Open\nAt age 17, Alcaraz made it to the main draw of the Australian Open, making him the youngest participant in the men's singles.[11] He won his Grand Slam tournament debut defeating fellow qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp in straight sets before losing in the second round to Mikael Ymer.[12]\n\n\nAlcaraz became the youngest match winner in the Madrid Open's history, defeating Adrian Mannarino as a wildcard and breaking then-18-year-old Rafael Nadal's record from 2004. In the second round, he lost to five-time champion Nadal on Alcaraz's 18th birthday.[13][14][15]\nBy winning the biggest title of his career until then at the 2021 Open de Oeiras III Challenger tournament, he entered the top 100 as the youngest player at the age of 18 on 24 May 2021.[16][17]\n\n\nAt the French Open, Alcaraz reached the third round of a major for the first time in his career by defeating Nikoloz Basilashvili.\n\n\nIn July 2021, he reached his first ATP final at the 2021 Croatia Open Umag, defeating top seed Albert Ramos Viñolas.[18] He then won his maiden ATP title by defeating Richard Gasquet and becoming the youngest tour-level champion since 18-year-old Kei Nishikori won the Delray Beach Open in 2008. Alcaraz was the youngest Spaniard to win an ATP Tour title since Nadal claimed his first trophy in Sopot in 2004.[19]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, he lost in the second round to Daniil Medvedev. At the Winston-Salem Open, Alcaraz reached the round of 16 defeating qualifier Alexei Popyrin, and his second tour-level quarterfinal of the season defeating fourth seed Márton Fucsovics.[20] He defeated Marcos Giron to reach the semifinals,[21] where he lost to Mikael Ymer.\n\n\nAt the US Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas in a fifth-set tiebreak to reach the fourth round in the biggest win of his career.[22] At 18 years of age, Alcaraz became the youngest man in a major fourth round since 17-year-old Andrei Medvedev at the 1992 French Open, and the youngest man in the US Open fourth round since 17-year-old Michael Chang and 18-year-old Pete Sampras in 1989.[23][24] He then reached the quarterfinals by defeating qualifier Peter Gojowczyk. Alcaraz became the youngest US Open men's quarterfinalist in the Open Era, the youngest at the tournament since 18-year-old Thomaz Koch in 1963, and the youngest Grand Slam tournament men's singles quarterfinalist since 18-year-old Michael Chang at the 1990 French Open. He then lost to Félix Auger-Aliassime via retirement in the second set in the quarterfinals after injuring his leg.[25]\n\n\nAt the Erste Bank Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 7 Matteo Berrettini, his second win over a top-10 player,[26] and became the youngest player in the top 35 on 1 November. During his Paris Masters run, Alcaraz defeated French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert in three thrilling sets in the first round.[27] He then defeated Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the second round, his third win over a top-10 player.[28] In the third round, he was defeated by Hugo Gaston in straight sets.[29]\n\n\nAt the Next Gen ATP Finals, Alcaraz defeated Brandon Nakashima, Juan Manuel Cerúndolo, and Holger Rune in the round-robin stage. He beat Sebastian Baez in the semifinal, and Sebastian Korda in the final.[30][31][32][33]\n\n\n\n### 2022: First major, youngest world No. 1, and year-end No. 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\nSeeded for the first time in a major at No. 31, Alcaraz reached the third round of the Australian Open before losing in five sets to Matteo Berrettini.[34]\n\n\nSeeded seventh at the Rio Open, Alcaraz won his first ATP 500 title by defeating Diego Schwartzman in the final.[35] He entered the top 20 in the singles rankings on 21 February 2022. In Indian Wells, Alcaraz reached his first Masters 1000 quarterfinal and semifinal, defeating defending champion Cameron Norrie before losing to Rafael Nadal.\n\n\nSeeded 14th at the Miami Open, Alcaraz defeated 6th seed Casper Ruud to win his first Masters 1000 title, the youngest men's champion in the tournament's history and the third-youngest ATP Masters 1000 titlist in history.[36]\n\n\nAt the Monte-Carlo Masters, Alcaraz lost in the second round to Sebastian Korda.[37] At the Barcelona Open, Alcaraz defeated top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals[38] to enter the top 10 in rankings for the first time on 25 April.[39][40] He became the 20th teen to break into top 10 overall since rankings were established in 1973, and the youngest since Rafael Nadal also on 25 April 2005.[41][42] Alcaraz later defeated Pablo Carreño Busta to win the title.[43]\n\n\nA day after his 19th birthday at the Madrid Open, he defeated 5-time Madrid champion, world No. 4 and third seed Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals to become the first teenager to defeat him on clay.[44] The following day, he beat the world No. 1 and top seed Novak Djokovic in the semifinals for his 6th straight top-10 win, and became the youngest player to win a match against a world No. 1 since 2004. He also became the first player to ever beat Djokovic and Nadal back-to-back on clay.[36][45][46] In the final, he won his fourth title for the season (and second Masters 1000), by defeating defending champion and world No. 3 Alexander Zverev, thereby defeating the top three seeds in three consecutive matches. He also became the youngest champion in tournament history.[47] As a result, he climbed to a career-high of world No. 6 in the rankings on 9 May 2022.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships\nFollowing his withdrawal from the Italian Open due to an ankle injury,[49] Alcaraz made his seeded debut at the French Open as No. 6. Having won two of the tour's biggest titles on clay coming into the Slam, he was widely projected to be one of the favorites for the title.[50] He defeated Juan Ignacio Londero in straight sets before saving a match point in a second round five-setter against Albert Ramos Viñolas.[51][52] He then defeated Korda and Karen Khachanov in straight sets before losing to Zverev, in the second major quarterfinal of his career.[53][54][55]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, Alcaraz beat Jan-Lennard Struff in a close five set match before defeating Tallon Griekspoor and Oscar Otte in straight sets, reaching the round of 16 for the first time at this major. He lost to Jannik Sinner in the fourth round.\n\n\nAt the Hamburg Open, he reached the final, resulting in a new career-high of world No. 5 on 25 July 2022. Alcaraz became the youngest player to enter the top 5 in rankings since Nadal in 2005.[56][57] He was defeated in the final by Lorenzo Musetti, resulting in the first loss in a tournament final of his career.[58] At the Croatia Open, he reached his second consecutive final, resulting in another ranking jump to world No. 4 on 1 August.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Evolution of Carlos Alcaraz compared to the \"Big Three\" in the ATP RANKING from 17 to 20 years old, on the left the starting ranking and the names of the players can be seen, and the highest ranking reached in the period are on the right.\nAlcaraz entered the 2022 US Open as the No. 3 seed.[61] He defeated Sebastian Baez, Federico Coria and Jenson Brooksby without dropping a set to reach the fourth round.[62] Next he defeated 15th seed Marin Čilić in five sets, becoming the youngest man to reach back-to-back quarterfinals at this Major in the Open Era.[63] In his quarterfinal match he defeated Jannik Sinner, saving a match point in the fourth set. The match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50AM EST) and second longest match (5 hours and 15 minutes) in US Open history.[64][65] He defeated Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals for his third consecutive five-set match victory.[66] He defeated 5th seed Casper Ruud in the final, where both players were in contention for the world No. 1 ranking, to win the title. Alcaraz became the youngest No. 1 in the history of the ATP Rankings at the age of 19 years, 4 months and 6 days, breaking Lleyton Hewitt's record.[5] He also became the first teenager in the Open Era to top the men's rankings and the youngest men's US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990.[67]\n\n\nIn his first match as world No. 1, Alcaraz lost his singles match at the 2022 Davis Cup Finals to Félix Auger-Aliassime.[68] Next, he lost to David Goffin at the Astana Open in his opening round. Alcaraz reached the semifinals in Basel, where he was defeated by the eventual champion Auger-Aliassime for a second time in the season.[69] At the Paris Masters, Alcaraz reached the quarterfinals after defeating Yoshihito Nishioka and Grigor Dimitrov, but retired while being a set down against Holger Rune.[70] A day later, Alcaraz announced he had suffered an abdominal tear requiring a six-week layoff, forcing him to end his season early. Alcaraz withdrew from the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup Finals.[71] Alcaraz, at the age of 19 years and 214 days, ended the year as youngest and first teenager world No. 1.[7]\n\n\n\n### 2023: 100th career win and Wimbledon champion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2023 French OpenOn 7 January, Alcaraz announced his withdrawal from the Australian Open due to a hamstring injury he suffered in his right leg while training.[72] Following the tournament, he lost the world No. 1 ranking to the champion Novak Djokovic.[73] He held the ranking for a total of 20 weeks.\n\n\nIn his first tournament for the 2023 season at the Golden Swing in South America, Alcaraz won his seventh title at the Argentina Open, defeating second seed Cameron Norrie.[74] Defending his title at the Rio Open, he reached back to back finals where he played against Norrie again, but lost in three sets.[75] Alcaraz was additionally scheduled to play in Acapulco in the month of February, but withdrew prior to the tournament after suffering another hamstring injury.[76]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Open he recorded his 100th career win, defeating 31st seed Tallon Griekspoor to reach the fourth round, making him the second fastest player to reach this milestone after John McEnroe, and faster than the Big 3.[77][36] After reaching the semifinals, Alcaraz defeated eleventh seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets in an anticipated match.[78][79] Defeating fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, he won his eighth career title and third Masters 1000 title, breaking Medvedev's 19-match winning streak, and becoming the first player to win the tournament without dropping a set since Roger Federer in 2017. He additionally became the ninth and youngest man to win both legs of the Sunshine Double. As a result, he returned to world No. 1 on 20 March 2023.[80] \nIn Miami where Alcaraz was the defending champion, he reached the semifinals having not dropped a set defeating Facundo Bagnis, Dušan Lajović, 16th seed Tommy Paul and ninth seed Taylor Fritz. This time he lost to Jannik Sinner in three sets.[81] He dropped to No. 2 in the rankings having not been able to defend his previous year title points.[82]\n\n\nAlcaraz was scheduled to play at the Monte-Carlo Masters the following week, but withdrew due to post-traumatic arthritis in his left hand and muscular discomfort in his spine.[83] He began the European clay court swing at the Barcelona Open; defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, he successfully defended his title without dropping a set.[84] He won his tenth career title at the Madrid Open again as the defending champion, defeating lucky loser Jan-Lennard Struff.[85] At the next clay court tournament, the Rome Masters, Alcaraz earned the opportunity to clinch the No. 1 ranking just by playing his second round match. Following his victory, he regained the top ranking from Novak Djokovic. However, he was upset in the next round by the world No. 135 Fabian Marozsan in straight sets, in what Jon Wertheim labelled the biggest upset of the year.[86][87]\n\n\nAt the 2023 French Open, Alcaraz advanced to the semifinals. In a highly anticipated match, he was defeated by Novak Djokovic in four sets, after suffering cramps at the onset of the third. Alcaraz and Djokovic had not played against each other in over a year, despite alternating between the world No. 1 ranking throughout 2023; Alcaraz would later claim the nerves of the occasion had partially led to his cramping. Djokovic regained the No. 1 ranking from Alcaraz, after he ultimately went on to win the tournament.[88][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2023 Carlos Alcaraz won his first Wimbledon title. At the Queen's Club Championships, he recorded his first title on grass in only his third career grass court tournament, beating Alex de Minaur in the final. The tournament win in London also returned him to the world No. 1 in rankings.[90] At the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, as the top seed, he reached the final following wins over Jérémy Chardy, Alexandre Müller, Nicolas Jarry, Matteo Berrettini, Holger Rune, and Daniil Medvedev. In a monumental match, Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in five sets, ending Djokovic's run to win a fifth consecutive title, and securing the No. 1 ranking. With this win, Alcaraz became the second player, after Andy Murray, to defeat Djokovic in a Wimbledon final.[91] Additionally, Alcaraz became the first non-\"Big 4\" player to win Wimbledon since Lleyton Hewitt's victory in 2002.[92]\n\n\nAlcaraz lost to Djokovic in a rematch of their Wimbledon final at the Cincinnati final. He lost in three sets, despite winning the first set, being 4–2 up in the second set, and having a championship point in the second-set tiebreak. It was the longest ever best-of-three-sets ATP Masters final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes.[93] At the 2023 US Open, where Alcaraz was looking to defend his grand slam title, he reached the semifinals having only dropped one set. However, he lost to 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev in four sets.[94] Alcaraz dropped to No. 2 in the rankings following the tournament, as Novak Djokovic was not defending any points.[95]\n\n\nAlcaraz entered the year-end indoor hardcourt season with the goal of gaining the year-end No. 1 ranking.[96][97] However, in the Asian swing, he lost to Jannik Sinner in the semifinals of Beijing for a second time in the season, and then to Grigor Dimitrov in the round of 16 at Shanghai.[98][99] He then withdrew from Basel due to injury,[100] and lost in his opening round at the Paris-Bercy Masters to Roman Safiullin.[101][102] His final tournament of the year will be the ATP Finals in Turin.[*citation needed*] Despite qualification for the 2023 ATP Next Generation Finals, he is expected not to play in said tournament.[103]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is sponsored by Nike for clothing and shoes, and by Babolat for racquets, using the Babolat Pure Aero 98 racquet.[104][105] In January 2022, he became a brand ambassador for Rolex.[106][107] He is also a brand ambassador for dermocosmetics company Isdin, Spanish food company ElPozo, and German automobile manufacturer BMW under their BMW Spain division.[108][109][110] In January 2023, he became ambassador for the American clothing brand Calvin Klein especially for their 1996 underwear campaign.[111] In June 2023, Alcaraz became a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton.[112]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is an all-court, all-round tennis player, but primarily employs an aggressive baseline style of play, with an emphasis on a high winner count from his forehand, typically his most reliable and potent shot. He can either hit his forehand flat and fast for winners from every court position, or add a great amount of topspin and margin over the net. He also possesses a well-rounded and more flat and lower net-clearance backhand groundstroke that he is able to redirect down the line for clean winners. His greatly disguised drop shot is key to his game, as he often combines the heaviness of his groundstrokes that pushes his opponents back into the court into a defensive position, with a drop shot that is often too well-placed and disguised to deal with. He has an impressive net-game with great drop volleys and drive volleys, and frequently serves-and-volleys on crucial points.[113]\n\n\nAlcaraz has a strong first serve for his mid-sized frame which is commonly around 115 to 120 mph and hit with average placement.[114] Alcaraz has a reliable second serve to which he can add topspin, in order to get a high bounce off the court and either push back or get a weak return from closer-returning opponents. This serve typically reaches 150 to 170 km/h (93 to 106 mph).[115]\n\n\nAlcaraz has earned acclaim for his athletic and physical traits. In particular, his direct sprints, counterattacking abilities, and an extremely high peak footspeed have garnered him comparisons to a young Rafael Nadal. He has been compared to Novak Djokovic for his assured lateral movement and court-coverage aided by physical splits and sliding through the court on defense, particularly on his backhand side where he is often able to neutralize his opponent's groundstroke aggression or drop shot attempts. Court coverage and exceptional touch have also been crucial in his success.[*citation needed*] In particular he is known for his frequent use of the drop shot.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Carlos Alcaraz career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 3R | A\n |  | 0 / 2\n | 3–2\n | 60%\n |\n| French Open | Q1 | 3R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 11–3\n | 79%\n |\n| Wimbledon | NH\n | 2R | 4R | **W** |  | 1 / 3\n | 11–2\n | 85%\n |\n| US Open | A\n | QF | **W** | SF |  | 1 / 3\n | 16–2\n | 89%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 8–4\n | 16–3\n | 17–2\n |  | 2 / 11\n | 41–9\n | 82%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 titles)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win | 2022 | US Open | Hard | ![Norway](image) Casper Ruud | 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–1), 6–3\n |\n| Win | 2023 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 1–6, 7–6(8–6), 6–1, 3–6, 6–4 |\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n#### Open Era records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Miami Open – 18 years, 11 months[116] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Madrid Open – 19 years[117] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to become ATP world No. 1 – 19 years, 4 months[118] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest year-end No. 1 – 19 years, 5 months[119] | **Stands alone** |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* ATP Newcomer of the Year (2020)\n* ATP Player of the Year (2022)\n* ATP Most Improved Player (2022)\n* Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year (2023)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players (since 1973)\n* Top ten ranked male tennis players\n* List of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n* World number 1 ranked male tennis players (all time, based on recognized tennis authorities)\n* ATP Awards\n* Tennis in Spain\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In ATP Tour and Grand Slam main draw matches, Summer Olympics, Davis Cup and Laver Cup\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Carlos Alcaraz | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

The win marked his fourth Shanghai title, and his ranking rose to No. 2.[280] On 31 October, Rafael Nadal announced his withdrawal from the Paris Masters due to an abdominal injury, and Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 ranking.[281] There, Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in a tight three-set semifinal, but was upset by the unseeded Karen Khachanov in the final.[282] At the ATP Finals, Djokovic was guaranteed a fifth year-end No. 1 ranking following the withdrawal of Rafael Nadal from the event. In the round-robin stage, he defeated Alexander Zverev, Marin Čilić, and John Isner without dropping a set. In the semifinals, he defeated Kevin Anderson to reach his seventh final at the tournament but was upset by Zverev.[283] At the 2018 Mubadala Championship, he scored victories over Karen Khachanov & Kevin Anderson to win the title.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Event\n | Since\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **ATP/ITF rankings** | 1973\n | Most weeks at world No. 1 (399)[326] | **Stands alone** |\n| 12 different years ranked world No. 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| Most points accumulated as world No. 1 (16,950) | **Stands alone** |\n| Eight-time Year-End world No. 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| 1978 | Seven-time ITF World Champion | **Stands alone** |\n| **Grand Slamtournaments** | 1877 | 24 Grand Slam singles titles[418] | **Stands alone** |\n| 1905 | Triple Career Grand Slam[335] | **Stands alone** |\n| 1978 | Champion of all four majors at once across three different surfaces | **Stands alone** |\n| 1905 | Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam | Don Budge |\n| 1978 | Surface Slam (major titles across all three different surfaces in a season) | Rafael Nadal |\n| 1877 | 4 streaks of 3+ consecutive majors | **Stands alone** |\n| 4 seasons winning 3 Major titles\n | **Stands alone** |\n| 7 seasons winning multiple Major titles\n | **Stands alone** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1992: Jim Courier\n* 1993: Sergi Bruguera\n* 1994: Sergi Bruguera\n* 1995: Thomas Muster\n* 1996: Yevgeny Kafelnikov\n* 1997: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 1998: Carlos Moyá\n* 1999: Andre Agassi\n* 2000: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 2001: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 2002: Albert Costa\n* 2003: Juan Carlos Ferrero\n* 2004: Gastón Gaudio\n* 2005: Rafael Nadal\n* 2006: Rafael Nadal\n* 2007: Rafael Nadal\n* 2008: Rafael Nadal\n* 2009: Roger Federer\n* 2010: Rafael Nadal\n* 2011: Rafael Nadal\n* 2012: Rafael Nadal\n* 2013: Rafael Nadal\n* 2014: Rafael Nadal\n* 2015: Stan Wawrinka\n* 2016: Novak Djokovic\n* 2017: Rafael Nadal\n* 2018: Rafael Nadal\n* 2019: Rafael Nadal\n* 2020: Rafael Nadal\n* 2021: Novak Djokovic\n* 2022: Rafael Nadal\n* 2023: Novak Djokovic\n* 2024: Carlos Alcaraz\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n211. **^** \"Novak Djokovic rolls Rafael Nadal win fourth Sony Open title\".

His next tournament was the Madrid Masters, where he lost to David Nalbandian in the semifinals. Djokovic, assured of finishing the year ranked No. 3, qualified for the year-ending championships, but did not advance beyond the round robin matches. He received the Golden Badge award for the best athlete in Serbia, and the Olympic Committee of Serbia declared him the best athlete in the country.[85]\n\n\nDjokovic played a key role in the 2007 play-off win over Australia by winning all his matches and helping promote the Serbia Davis Cup team to the 2008 World Group.[86] In Serbia's tie against Russia in Moscow in early 2008, Djokovic was sidelined due to influenza and missed his first singles match.

This was the first time a player had defeated the top three ranked players in one tournament since Boris Becker in 1994.[82] Djokovic was also only the second player, after Tomáš Berdych, to have defeated both Federer and Nadal since they became the top two players in the world. After this tournament, Björn Borg stated that Djokovic \"is definitely a contender to win a Grand Slam (tournament).\"[83] The following week at the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic lost in the second round to Moyà in straight sets. Nevertheless, he went on to reach the final of the US Open, where he had five set points in the first set and two in the second set, but lost them all before losing the match in straight sets to the top-seeded Federer.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** \"Novak Djokovic will be Serbia's flag bearer at Olympics\". 8 June 2012.

This marked Djokovic's eighth win at the Australian Open and 17th Grand Slam title.[302] With the win, Djokovic regained the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings,[303] and became the first player since Ken Rosewall to win major titles in three different decades, and the first to do so in the Open Era. The match also marked the first time Djokovic came back to win a major final after trailing two sets to one, having lost each of the last seven times this happened.[304] Djokovic then won the title at Dubai Championships for the fifth time, defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final.[305][306]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic began his grass court season at the Gerry Weber Open where after the withdrawal of Federer, he competed as the top seed. He advanced to the final, where he lost to Tommy Haas.[109] Djokovic then lost to Haas again, this time in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon.[110] During the US Open Series, Djokovic made the quarterfinals of the Canadian Open in Montreal before losing to Roddick. At the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic defeated Nadal in the semifinals before losing in the final to Federer.[111] At the US Open, Djokovic reached the semifinals, where he was defeated by Federer.[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1938: Don Budge\n* 1939: Don McNeill\n* 1946: Marcel Bernard\n* 1947: József Asbóth\n* 1948: Frank Parker\n* 1949: Frank Parker\n* 1950: Budge Patty\n* 1951: Jaroslav Drobný\n* 1952: Jaroslav Drobný\n* 1953: Ken Rosewall\n* 1954: Tony Trabert\n* 1955: Tony Trabert\n* 1956: Lew Hoad\n* 1957: Sven Davidson\n* 1958: Mervyn Rose\n* 1959: Nicola Pietrangeli\n* 1960: Nicola Pietrangeli\n* 1961: Manuel Santana\n* 1962: Rod Laver\n* 1963: Roy Emerson\n* 1964: Manuel Santana\n* 1965: Fred Stolle\n* 1966: Tony Roche\n* 1967: Roy Emerson\n |\n| Open Era | * 1968: Ken Rosewall\n* 1969: Rod Laver\n* 1970: Jan Kodeš\n* 1971: Jan Kodeš\n* 1972: Andrés Gimeno\n* 1973: Ilie Năstase\n* 1974: Björn Borg\n* 1975: Björn Borg\n* 1976: Adriano Panatta\n* 1977: Guillermo Vilas\n* 1978: Björn Borg\n* 1979: Björn Borg\n* 1980: Björn Borg\n* 1981: Björn Borg\n* 1982: Mats Wilander\n* 1983: Yannick Noah\n* 1984: Ivan Lendl\n* 1985: Mats Wilander\n* 1986: Ivan Lendl\n* 1987: Ivan Lendl\n* 1988: Mats Wilander\n* 1989: Michael Chang\n* 1990: Andrés Gómez\n* 1991: Jim Courier\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Other tournaments |\n| Tour Finals | **W** (2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2022, 2023) |\n| Olympic Games | ![](image) (2008) |\n| Doubles |\n| Career record | 63–79 (44.4%)[b] |\n| Career titles | 1 |\n| Highest ranking | No. 114 (30 November 2009)[5] |\n| Grand Slam doubles results |\n| Australian Open | 1R (2006, 2007) |\n| French Open | 1R (2006) |\n| Wimbledon | 2R (2006) |\n| US Open | 1R (2006) |\n| Other doubles tournaments |\n| Olympic Games | 2R (2016) |\n| Other mixed doubles tournaments |\n| Olympic Games | SF – 4th (2020) |\n| Team competitions |\n| Davis Cup | **W** (2010) |\n| Hopman Cup | F (2008, 2013) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| President of the ATP Player Council |\n| **In office**30 August 2016 – 30 August 2020 |\n| Vice President | Kevin Anderson |\n| Preceded by | Eric Butorac |\n| Succeeded by | Kevin Anderson |\n|  |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Last updated on: 20 November 2023. |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe continued his good form on clay at the French Open by reaching the final without dropping a set in the first five rounds, including a quarterfinal clash with Nadal and a five-set semifinal victory over No. 3 seed Andy Murray which took two days to complete. This meant he became only the second man to have won against Nadal at the French Open. However, he lost the next match and the tournament to No. 8 seed Stan Wawrinka in four sets.[230] Five weeks later, he rebounded again from the tough loss in Paris, just like 2014, coming from two sets down to beat Kevin Anderson in the fourth round, and then going on to claim his third Wimbledon title, with a four-set win over Roger Federer.[231]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Novak Djokovic (Achievement predecessor & successor)\n |\n| --- |\n| | Sporting positions\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byRafael Nadal Roger FedererRafael NadalRafael NadalRafael NadalDaniil MedvedevCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos Alcaraz\n |  **World No. 1** July 4, 2011 – July 8, 2012November 5, 2012 – October 6, 2013July 7, 2014 – November 6, 2016November 5, 2018 – November 5, 2019February 3, 2020 – Feb 28, 2022Mar 21, 2022 – Jun 12, 2022Jan 30, 2023 – Mar 19, 2023Apr 3, 2023 – May 21, 2023Jun 12, 2023 – Jun 25, 2023Sep 11, 2023 – Jun 10, 2024\n | Succeeded byRoger Federer Rafael NadalAndy MurrayRafael NadalDaniil MedvedevDaniil MedvedevCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazJannik Sinner\n |\n| Preceded byMardy Fish\n |  **US Open Series Champion** 2012 | Succeeded byRafael Nadal\n |\n| Awards\n |\n| Preceded byRafael Nadal\n |  **ATP Most Improved Player** 2006, 2007 | Succeeded byJo-Wilfried Tsonga\n |\n| Preceded byOlivera JevtićNađa HiglDavor Štefanek\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n430. **^** \"Novak Djokovic Continues Big Titles Dominance With US Open Victory\". *ATP Tour*. 10 September 2023.

He broke his own ATP ranking points record, bringing it up to 16,790. Djokovic then proceeded to win his sixth Australian Open. On his road to his Open Era record sixth title in Melbourne, he defeated Roger Federer in four sets in the semifinals, and in a rematch of the 2015 final, he defeated Andy Murray, in three straight sets.[238] He quickly rebounded from an eye infection at the Dubai Championships to collect a fifth Indian Wells Masters title, defeating Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, and Milos Raonic in the final.

In the final, Djokovic scored two singles points for Serbia, defeating Gilles Simon and Gaël Monfils.[133] He was the backbone of the Serbian squad, going 7–0 in singles rubbers to lead the nation to the title, although the honour of winning the deciding rubber in the final went to compatriot Viktor Troicki. This two singles rubbers wins started a long unbeaten run that went on into 2011. Djokovic finished the year ranked No. 3, his fourth successive finish at this position.

At the Australian Open, he won his first four matches in straight sets against Lukáš Lacko, Leonardo Mayer, Denis Istomin, and No. 15 seed Fabio Fognini respectively. He met Wawrinka in the quarterfinals of the tournament, the second consecutive year the two had met at the event. Despite coming back from two sets to one down, Djokovic fell 9–7 in the fifth set, ending his 25–match winning streak in Melbourne, as well as his streak of 14 consecutive Grand Slam tournament semifinals.[210]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic is an aggressive baseline player.[544] His groundstrokes from both wings are consistent, deep, and penetrating. His backhand is widely regarded as the greatest two-handed backhand of all time, due to its effectiveness on both sides of the court and its accuracy.[545][546][547] His best shot is his backhand down the line, with great pace and precision. He excels at returning serve in particular, and regularly ranks among the tour leaders in return points, return games, and break points won. His forehand is deemed to be underrated, yet one of the best, due to its versatility.[548] After great technical difficulties during the 2009 season (coinciding with his switch to the Head racket series), his serve is one of his major weapons again, winning him many free points; his first serve is typically hit flat, while he prefers to slice and kick his second serves wide.[544] He has also led the ATP Tour in their career \"Under Pressure Rating\" statistic, in part because of his prowess at winning deciding sets.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** \"Angry Djokovic exacts revenge on Roddick\".

His next tournament was the 2008 Summer Olympics, his first Olympics. He and Nenad Zimonjić, seeded second in men's doubles, were eliminated in the first round by the Czech pairing of Martin Damm and Pavel Vízner.

With his 22nd Masters title, Djokovic became the first player to complete the Indian Wells – Miami title double three times.[225][226] In April, Djokovic clinched his second Monte-Carlo Masters by beating Tomáš Berdych in the final.[227] Therefore, Djokovic became the first man to win the first three ATP Masters 1000 titles of the season.[228] Djokovic withdrew from the 2015 Madrid Masters.[229] He won the title for the fourth time at the Rome Masters, making it 4 out of 4 titles in Masters events entered by Djokovic in the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic entered the Dubai Championships in February, where vaccination was not required for entry.[377] He was upset in the quarterfinals by eventual finalist Jiří Veselý, resulting in him conceding his world No. 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev.

It was his earliest exit in a Grand Slam since the 2009 French Open.[250]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic entered the French Open in May as the defending champion. After defeating Yoshihito Nishioka, Alex Molčan, Aljaž Bedene and Diego Schwartzman in straight sets, he faced Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals for their record-extending 59th meeting.

In addition to leading the ATP Tour in match wins, he reached a career-best ten finals, winning five titles.[118]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\n#### 2010: US Open final & Davis Cup crown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n436. **^** \"Djokovic repels Rune charge, secures year-end No. 1\". *www.nittoatpfinals.com*. 12 November 2023.

Afterwards, Djokovic briefly considered moving from Serbia to play for Great Britain.[65] The British media spoke of Djokovic's family negotiating with the Lawn Tennis Association about changing his international loyalty by joining British tennis ranks.[65] The 18-year-old Djokovic, who was ranked 64th in the world, initially dismissed the story by saying that the talks were not serious, describing them as \"the British being very kind to us after the Davis Cup.\"[66] However, more than three years later, in October 2009, Djokovic confirmed that the talks between his family and the LTA throughout April and May 2006 were indeed serious:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Canada, Djokovic won his single-season record-breaking fifth Masters title with a three-set win over Mardy Fish in the final.[147] At the US Open, Djokovic beat Federer and Nadal on the way to the title, thus becoming only the second player to defeat both of them in the same Major event after Juan Martín del Potro in the 2009 US Open.[148] Djokovic saved match points en route to the title, saving two against Federer in the semifinals to complete a comeback from two sets down,[149][150] thus becoming just the second player to beat Federer from two sets down after Tsonga a few months earlier in Wimbledon.[151] Djokovic's crosscourt forehand return winner to save the first match point is widely regarded as one of the greatest shots in US Open history as well as one of the greatest returns in tennis history.[152][153] This was the second consecutive US Open where Djokovic saved two match points against Federer to reach the final, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2011 U.S. Open: Novak Djokovic overcomes back pain, Rafael Nadal to win marathon match\". *The Washington Post*. 12 September 2011.

Djokovic and Murray are one of two pairs to have met in each of the four major finals (other pair being Djokovic and Nadal). The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being a week older than Djokovic. They went to training camp together, and Murray was the winner of the first match they ever played as teenagers. One of their most notable matches was a three-set thriller at the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters, in which Murray held five championship point opportunities in the second set; however, Djokovic saved each of them, forcing a deciding set.[456] He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title, ending Murray's 12–0 winning streak at the event. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic is the player with the most victories over Federer and the only player to beat Federer multiple times at his most successful major tournaments, four times at the Australian Open, three times at the US Open, three times at the Year-end Championship and most notably, three times at the final of Wimbledon Championships. Their most recent final was at the 2019 Wimbledon where Djokovic won in five sets in what became the longest final in Wimbledon history.[451][452] Other notable matches they contested are the 2014 Wimbledon and 2015 Wimbledon finals, along with semifinals at the 2010 US Open, 2011 US Open, 2011 French Open, and 2018 Paris Masters.[150][453][454]\n\n\n\n### Andy Murray[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Murray rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a triumphant grass season, Djokovic started his North American hardcourt swing with a third-round showing at the Canadian Open, losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas. Afterwards, he returned to play the Cincinnati Masters for the first time in three years. In an event plagued by suspended play due to rain, Djokovic defeated the defending champion Grigor Dimitrov, Milos Raonic, and Marin Čilić to reach his sixth final at the tournament and fourth final against Roger Federer. Although Federer was riding a streak of 100 consecutive holds of serve at the tournament,[276] dating back to the 2014 final,[277] Djokovic broke his serve three times to win his first Cincinnati Masters title. With this victory, Djokovic became the first (and, as of 2022, only) player in tennis history to complete the Career Golden Masters — winning all nine ATP Masters events at least once in one's career.[278]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** The Men's Player of the Decade: Novak Djokovic Archived 23 July 2023 at the Wayback Machine, Tennis magazine\n9. **^** \"Uncovered: The Best Seasons Of Novak Djokovic's Career\". *ATP Tour*. 31 March 2020.

The two contested in the longest major finals match ever played at the 2012 Australian Open where Djokovic won in five sets lasting 5 hours and 53 minutes.[440][441][442] Other classics they played include the 2009 Madrid Masters semifinal,[443] 2011 Miami Masters final,[444][445] the 2013 French Open semifinal,[446] 2018 Wimbledon semifinal,[447][448] and the 2021 French Open semifinal.[449]\n\n\n\n### Roger Federer[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Federer rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n479. **^** \"Australian Open 2019: Novak Djokovic beats Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to reach third round\".

At the 2018 Australian Open, he reached the fourth round, where he was upset by Chung Hyeon. In late January, he underwent surgery on his elbow.[263] On 3 March, Djokovic returned to the practice courts,[264] and surprisingly played at Indian Wells only a week later, losing in the second round to Taro Daniel.[265] He then lost to Benoît Paire in the second round of the Miami Open.[266]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith his first-round win at the Wimbledon Championships against Kwon Soon-woo, Djokovic became the first player in history (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four Grand Slams.[388] With his semifinal win over Cameron Norrie, Djokovic reached a record 32nd Grand Slam final, one ahead of Roger Federer.[389] Djokovic went on to defeat Nick Kyrgios in the final in four sets for his fourth consecutive and seventh overall Wimbledon trophy.[390]\nWith this victory, he reached a total of 21 major titles, which broke his tie of 20 majors with Federer and put him one Grand Slam title behind Nadal.[391][392]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTennis pundits have classified many of Djokovic's matches as some of the greatest contests ever, such as the 2012 Australian Open final, in which he beat Nadal in five long and gruelling sets.[537][538] Other matches include the five-set 2013 Australian Open fourth round against Stan Wawrinka,[188][189] the 2018 Wimbledon semifinal against Nadal, which lasted five brutal sets played over two days,[539][540] the five-set 2019 Wimbledon final against Roger Federer, the longest Wimbledon final in history,[541][542] and the 2023 Cincinnati Masters final against Carlos Alcaraz, the longest best-of-three-sets final in ATP Tour history.[422][423]\n\n\nSome analysts claim that the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry ranks as the best rivalry in tennis history because of the quality of matches they produce.[543]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n### Playing style[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the final Grand Slam event of the year, Djokovic had the chance to become the first man in history to complete the full set of Masters titles in Cincinnati, achieving the Career Golden Masters, but he lost the final to Federer (Djokovic would accomplish the feat at the 2018 and 2020 events).[232] At the US Open, Djokovic reached the final for the sixth time in his career, achieving the feat of reaching all four Grand Slam finals in a single calendar year. In the final, he faced Federer once again, defeating him in four sets to win his third Grand Slam title of the year, his second title at Flushing Meadows, and his tenth Grand Slam singles title overall, becoming the fifth man in the Open Era to win double-digit Grand Slam singles titles, as well as only the third man to reach all four Major finals in a calendar year.[233]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n261. **^** \"Novak Djokovic will miss the rest of 2017 season with elbow injury\". *The Guardian*. 16 July 2017.

He could not find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson agreed to make him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head.[556] After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign.[557] Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head Synthetic Leather Grip as a replacement grip.[558] In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.[559]\n\n\n\n### Coaching and personal team[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### 2008: First Major title, two Masters & first Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic started his preparations for the season by playing the Hopman Cup with fellow Serbian world No. 3 Jelena Janković where he won all of his four singles matches, including in the final against the United States, where he beat Mardy Fish in a deciding set tiebreak to level the tie, but then losing the decisive mixed doubles rubber,[88] in which he faced former WTA No. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPete Sampras declared Djokovic's 2011 season as the best he had seen in his lifetime, calling it \"one of the best achievements in all of the sports.\"[161] Boris Becker called Djokovic's season \"one of the very best years in tennis of all time\", noting that it \"may not be the best statistically, but he's beaten Federer, he's beaten Nadal, he's beaten everybody that came around to challenge him in the biggest tournaments in the world.\"[162] Rafael Nadal, who lost to Djokovic in six finals on hard, clay and grass courts, described Djokovic's performances as \"probably the highest level of tennis that I ever saw.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### 2012: Australian Open title, three Masters & Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the French Open, Djokovic advanced to the final after defeating Rafael Nadal in a four-set semifinal epic.

He won 11 titles including a season-record 10 Big Titles (three Majors, six Masters, and the Year-end Championships) on all court surfaces and conditions (hard, clay, grass and indoors). Djokovic set a season-record of 16,585 for most ranking points accumulated as world No. 1. and had a season-record 31 victories over top-10 players, including a remarkable 15–4 winning record against the other members of the Big Four, Federer, Nadal, and Murray. The 2015 season is Djokovic's most successful season as of 2022, and it is considered one of the greatest seasons in tennis history.[237]\n\n\n\n#### 2016: Historic 'Nole Slam', four Masters & ranking points record[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThey met again two months later at the Olympics, with Djokovic winning in straight sets in the quarterfinals.[476] They contested the final of the 2012 China Open, where Djokovic was victorious once again, in straight sets.[477] The pair were drawn in the same pool for the 2012 ATP Finals in which Djokovic prevailed in the first (of three) round robin matches.[478] It was Djokovic's fifth win over Tsonga in 2012. Their final major meeting was in the second round of the 2019 Australian Open,[479] which Djokovic won in straight sets.\n\n\n\n### Daniil Medvedev[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Daniil Medvedev have met 15 times, with Djokovic leading 10–5.[480][481] They have contested three major finals, with Djokovic winning the 2021 Australian Open and the 2023 US Open, and Medvedev winning his first major title at the 2021 US Open, also ending Djokovic's quest for a calendar-year Grand Slam.[482]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to Djokovic's unvaccinated status against COVID-19, he was unable to compete in the US Open as the US government did not allow unvaccinated non-US citizens to enter the country.[393] As a result, he withdrew from the tournament on 25 August.[394] At the Astana Open in October, he defeated Medvedev in the semifinals and Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final to win his 90th singles title.[395] Djokovic also qualified for the ATP Finals for the 15th time.[396][397]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic and Stan Wawrinka have met 27 times with Djokovic leading 21–6. However, the two have contested numerous close matches, including four five-setters at the majors.[459] Wawrinka and Djokovic have met in three consecutive Australian Opens – with each match going to five sets – and a five-setter in the US Open. In the 2013 Australian Open fourth round, Djokovic won 12–10 in a fifth set, with the match being considered one of the best ever played;[460][187][188][191][189][461] at the 2013 US Open semifinals Djokovic won 6–4 in the fifth set; at the 2014 Australian Open quarterfinals, Wawrinka won 9–7 in the fifth. Wawrinka's win broke Djokovic's run of 14 consecutive major semifinals, and ended a 28-match winning streak; and Wawrinka went on to win his first major title at the tournament.[462] Djokovic got revenge the next year at the 2015 Australian Open, winning 6–0 in the fifth set.[463]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic has 80% stake in biotech firm QuantBioRes which claims to be developing a drug to treat patients who have contracted COVID-19.[637] Their research is based on electromagnetic frequency; one biomedical scientist likened it to homeopathy and argued that it \"does not reflect a contemporary understanding of how biochemistry works\", while Peter Collignon commented that their website \"describes a way of finding a new molecule without providing any evidence of success\".[638]\n\n\n\n### Professional Tennis Players Association[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Djokovic resigned from the Players Council of the Association of Tennis Professionals and formed the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) with Vasek Pospisil. The pair will serve as co-presidents of the new organisation to promote the interests of male and female tennis players above a ranking of 500 in singles and 200 in doubles.[639]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic began his season by winning the Australian Open. In the quarterfinals, he defeated David Ferrer in three sets. In the semifinal, Djokovic beat Andy Murray in five sets after 4 hours and 50 minutes, recovering from a two-sets-to-one deficit and fending off break points at 5-all in the fifth set.[164] In the final, Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal in five sets, recovering from losing the first set and then a break down in the final set to win 7–5. At 5 hours and 53 minutes, the match was the longest Grand Slam final in Open Era history, as well as the longest match in Australian Open history, surpassing the 5-hour and 14-minute 2009 semifinal between Nadal and Fernando Verdasco.[165]\n\n\nDjokovic was beaten by John Isner in the semifinals at Indian Wells. He successfully defended his title in Miami after beating Murray in the final.[166] In the Monte Carlo final, he lost in straight sets to Nadal.

The win marked his fourth Shanghai title, and his ranking rose to No. 2.[280] On 31 October, Rafael Nadal announced his withdrawal from the Paris Masters due to an abdominal injury, and Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 ranking.[281] There, Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in a tight three-set semifinal, but was upset by the unseeded Karen Khachanov in the final.[282] At the ATP Finals, Djokovic was guaranteed a fifth year-end No. 1 ranking following the withdrawal of Rafael Nadal from the event. In the round-robin stage, he defeated Alexander Zverev, Marin Čilić, and John Isner without dropping a set. In the semifinals, he defeated Kevin Anderson to reach his seventh final at the tournament but was upset by Zverev.[283] At the 2018 Mubadala Championship, he scored victories over Karen Khachanov & Kevin Anderson to win the title.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Event\n | Since\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **ATP/ITF rankings** | 1973\n | Most weeks at world No. 1 (399)[326] | **Stands alone** |\n| 12 different years ranked world No. 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| Most points accumulated as world No. 1 (16,950) | **Stands alone** |\n| Eight-time Year-End world No. 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| 1978 | Seven-time ITF World Champion | **Stands alone** |\n| **Grand Slamtournaments** | 1877 | 24 Grand Slam singles titles[418] | **Stands alone** |\n| 1905 | Triple Career Grand Slam[335] | **Stands alone** |\n| 1978 | Champion of all four majors at once across three different surfaces | **Stands alone** |\n| 1905 | Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam | Don Budge |\n| 1978 | Surface Slam (major titles across all three different surfaces in a season) | Rafael Nadal |\n| 1877 | 4 streaks of 3+ consecutive majors | **Stands alone** |\n| 4 seasons winning 3 Major titles\n | **Stands alone** |\n| 7 seasons winning multiple Major titles\n | **Stands alone** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1992: Jim Courier\n* 1993: Sergi Bruguera\n* 1994: Sergi Bruguera\n* 1995: Thomas Muster\n* 1996: Yevgeny Kafelnikov\n* 1997: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 1998: Carlos Moyá\n* 1999: Andre Agassi\n* 2000: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 2001: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 2002: Albert Costa\n* 2003: Juan Carlos Ferrero\n* 2004: Gastón Gaudio\n* 2005: Rafael Nadal\n* 2006: Rafael Nadal\n* 2007: Rafael Nadal\n* 2008: Rafael Nadal\n* 2009: Roger Federer\n* 2010: Rafael Nadal\n* 2011: Rafael Nadal\n* 2012: Rafael Nadal\n* 2013: Rafael Nadal\n* 2014: Rafael Nadal\n* 2015: Stan Wawrinka\n* 2016: Novak Djokovic\n* 2017: Rafael Nadal\n* 2018: Rafael Nadal\n* 2019: Rafael Nadal\n* 2020: Rafael Nadal\n* 2021: Novak Djokovic\n* 2022: Rafael Nadal\n* 2023: Novak Djokovic\n* 2024: Carlos Alcaraz\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n211. **^** \"Novak Djokovic rolls Rafael Nadal win fourth Sony Open title\".

This was the first time a player had defeated the top three ranked players in one tournament since Boris Becker in 1994.[82] Djokovic was also only the second player, after Tomáš Berdych, to have defeated both Federer and Nadal since they became the top two players in the world. After this tournament, Björn Borg stated that Djokovic \"is definitely a contender to win a Grand Slam (tournament).\"[83] The following week at the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic lost in the second round to Moyà in straight sets.

This marked Djokovic's eighth win at the Australian Open and 17th Grand Slam title.[302] With the win, Djokovic regained the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings,[303] and became the first player since Ken Rosewall to win major titles in three different decades, and the first to do so in the Open Era. The match also marked the first time Djokovic came back to win a major final after trailing two sets to one, having lost each of the last seven times this happened.[304] Djokovic then won the title at Dubai Championships for the fifth time, defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final.[305][306]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic began his grass court season at the Gerry Weber Open where after the withdrawal of Federer, he competed as the top seed. He advanced to the final, where he lost to Tommy Haas.[109] Djokovic then lost to Haas again, this time in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon.[110] During the US Open Series, Djokovic made the quarterfinals of the Canadian Open in Montreal before losing to Roddick. At the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic defeated Nadal in the semifinals before losing in the final to Federer.[111] At the US Open, Djokovic reached the semifinals, where he was defeated by Federer.[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1938: Don Budge\n* 1939: Don McNeill\n* 1946: Marcel Bernard\n* 1947: József Asbóth\n* 1948: Frank Parker\n* 1949: Frank Parker\n* 1950: Budge Patty\n* 1951: Jaroslav Drobný\n* 1952: Jaroslav Drobný\n* 1953: Ken Rosewall\n* 1954: Tony Trabert\n* 1955: Tony Trabert\n* 1956: Lew Hoad\n* 1957: Sven Davidson\n* 1958: Mervyn Rose\n* 1959: Nicola Pietrangeli\n* 1960: Nicola Pietrangeli\n* 1961: Manuel Santana\n* 1962: Rod Laver\n* 1963: Roy Emerson\n* 1964: Manuel Santana\n* 1965: Fred Stolle\n* 1966: Tony Roche\n* 1967: Roy Emerson\n |\n| Open Era | * 1968: Ken Rosewall\n* 1969: Rod Laver\n* 1970: Jan Kodeš\n* 1971: Jan Kodeš\n* 1972: Andrés Gimeno\n* 1973: Ilie Năstase\n* 1974: Björn Borg\n* 1975: Björn Borg\n* 1976: Adriano Panatta\n* 1977: Guillermo Vilas\n* 1978: Björn Borg\n* 1979: Björn Borg\n* 1980: Björn Borg\n* 1981: Björn Borg\n* 1982: Mats Wilander\n* 1983: Yannick Noah\n* 1984: Ivan Lendl\n* 1985: Mats Wilander\n* 1986: Ivan Lendl\n* 1987: Ivan Lendl\n* 1988: Mats Wilander\n* 1989: Michael Chang\n* 1990: Andrés Gómez\n* 1991: Jim Courier\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Other tournaments |\n| Tour Finals | **W** (2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2022, 2023) |\n| Olympic Games | ![](image) (2008) |\n| Doubles |\n| Career record | 63–79 (44.4%)[b] |\n| Career titles | 1 |\n| Highest ranking | No. 114 (30 November 2009)[5] |\n| Grand Slam doubles results |\n| Australian Open | 1R (2006, 2007) |\n| French Open | 1R (2006) |\n| Wimbledon | 2R (2006) |\n| US Open | 1R (2006) |\n| Other doubles tournaments |\n| Olympic Games | 2R (2016) |\n| Other mixed doubles tournaments |\n| Olympic Games | SF – 4th (2020) |\n| Team competitions |\n| Davis Cup | **W** (2010) |\n| Hopman Cup | F (2008, 2013) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| President of the ATP Player Council |\n| **In office**30 August 2016 – 30 August 2020 |\n| Vice President | Kevin Anderson |\n| Preceded by | Eric Butorac |\n| Succeeded by | Kevin Anderson |\n|  |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Last updated on: 20 November 2023. |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe continued his good form on clay at the French Open by reaching the final without dropping a set in the first five rounds, including a quarterfinal clash with Nadal and a five-set semifinal victory over No. 3 seed Andy Murray which took two days to complete. This meant he became only the second man to have won against Nadal at the French Open. However, he lost the next match and the tournament to No. 8 seed Stan Wawrinka in four sets.[230] Five weeks later, he rebounded again from the tough loss in Paris, just like 2014, coming from two sets down to beat Kevin Anderson in the fourth round, and then going on to claim his third Wimbledon title, with a four-set win over Roger Federer.[231]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Novak Djokovic (Achievement predecessor & successor)\n |\n| --- |\n| | Sporting positions\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byRafael Nadal Roger FedererRafael NadalRafael NadalRafael NadalDaniil MedvedevCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos Alcaraz\n |  **World No. 1** July 4, 2011 – July 8, 2012November 5, 2012 – October 6, 2013July 7, 2014 – November 6, 2016November 5, 2018 – November 5, 2019February 3, 2020 – Feb 28, 2022Mar 21, 2022 – Jun 12, 2022Jan 30, 2023 – Mar 19, 2023Apr 3, 2023 – May 21, 2023Jun 12, 2023 – Jun 25, 2023Sep 11, 2023 – Jun 10, 2024\n | Succeeded byRoger Federer Rafael NadalAndy MurrayRafael NadalDaniil MedvedevDaniil MedvedevCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazJannik Sinner\n |\n| Preceded byMardy Fish\n |  **US Open Series Champion** 2012 | Succeeded byRafael Nadal\n |\n| Awards\n |\n| Preceded byRafael Nadal\n |  **ATP Most Improved Player** 2006, 2007 | Succeeded byJo-Wilfried Tsonga\n |\n| Preceded byOlivera JevtićNađa HiglDavor Štefanek\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n430. **^** \"Novak Djokovic Continues Big Titles Dominance With US Open Victory\". *ATP Tour*. 10 September 2023.

He broke his own ATP ranking points record, bringing it up to 16,790. Djokovic then proceeded to win his sixth Australian Open. On his road to his Open Era record sixth title in Melbourne, he defeated Roger Federer in four sets in the semifinals, and in a rematch of the 2015 final, he defeated Andy Murray, in three straight sets.[238] He quickly rebounded from an eye infection at the Dubai Championships to collect a fifth Indian Wells Masters title, defeating Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, and Milos Raonic in the final.

In the final, Djokovic scored two singles points for Serbia, defeating Gilles Simon and Gaël Monfils.[133] He was the backbone of the Serbian squad, going 7–0 in singles rubbers to lead the nation to the title, although the honour of winning the deciding rubber in the final went to compatriot Viktor Troicki. This two singles rubbers wins started a long unbeaten run that went on into 2011. Djokovic finished the year ranked No. 3, his fourth successive finish at this position.

At the Australian Open, he won his first four matches in straight sets against Lukáš Lacko, Leonardo Mayer, Denis Istomin, and No. 15 seed Fabio Fognini respectively. He met Wawrinka in the quarterfinals of the tournament, the second consecutive year the two had met at the event. Despite coming back from two sets to one down, Djokovic fell 9–7 in the fifth set, ending his 25–match winning streak in Melbourne, as well as his streak of 14 consecutive Grand Slam tournament semifinals.[210]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic is an aggressive baseline player.[544] His groundstrokes from both wings are consistent, deep, and penetrating. His backhand is widely regarded as the greatest two-handed backhand of all time, due to its effectiveness on both sides of the court and its accuracy.[545][546][547] His best shot is his backhand down the line, with great pace and precision. He excels at returning serve in particular, and regularly ranks among the tour leaders in return points, return games, and break points won. His forehand is deemed to be underrated, yet one of the best, due to its versatility.[548] After great technical difficulties during the 2009 season (coinciding with his switch to the Head racket series), his serve is one of his major weapons again, winning him many free points; his first serve is typically hit flat, while he prefers to slice and kick his second serves wide.[544] He has also led the ATP Tour in their career \"Under Pressure Rating\" statistic, in part because of his prowess at winning deciding sets.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** \"Angry Djokovic exacts revenge on Roddick\".

His next tournament was the 2008 Summer Olympics, his first Olympics. He and Nenad Zimonjić, seeded second in men's doubles, were eliminated in the first round by the Czech pairing of Martin Damm and Pavel Vízner.

With his 22nd Masters title, Djokovic became the first player to complete the Indian Wells – Miami title double three times.[225][226] In April, Djokovic clinched his second Monte-Carlo Masters by beating Tomáš Berdych in the final.[227] Therefore, Djokovic became the first man to win the first three ATP Masters 1000 titles of the season.[228] Djokovic withdrew from the 2015 Madrid Masters.[229] He won the title for the fourth time at the Rome Masters, making it 4 out of 4 titles in Masters events entered by Djokovic in the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic entered the Dubai Championships in February, where vaccination was not required for entry.[377] He was upset in the quarterfinals by eventual finalist Jiří Veselý, resulting in him conceding his world No. 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev.

It was his earliest exit in a Grand Slam since the 2009 French Open.[250]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic entered the French Open in May as the defending champion. After defeating Yoshihito Nishioka, Alex Molčan, Aljaž Bedene and Diego Schwartzman in straight sets, he faced Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals for their record-extending 59th meeting.

In addition to leading the ATP Tour in match wins, he reached a career-best ten finals, winning five titles.[118]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\n#### 2010: US Open final & Davis Cup crown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n436. **^** \"Djokovic repels Rune charge, secures year-end No. 1\". *www.nittoatpfinals.com*. 12 November 2023.

Afterwards, Djokovic briefly considered moving from Serbia to play for Great Britain.[65] The British media spoke of Djokovic's family negotiating with the Lawn Tennis Association about changing his international loyalty by joining British tennis ranks.[65] The 18-year-old Djokovic, who was ranked 64th in the world, initially dismissed the story by saying that the talks were not serious, describing them as \"the British being very kind to us after the Davis Cup.\"[66] However, more than three years later, in October 2009, Djokovic confirmed that the talks between his family and the LTA throughout April and May 2006 were indeed serious:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Canada, Djokovic won his single-season record-breaking fifth Masters title with a three-set win over Mardy Fish in the final.[147] At the US Open, Djokovic beat Federer and Nadal on the way to the title, thus becoming only the second player to defeat both of them in the same Major event after Juan Martín del Potro in the 2009 US Open.[148] Djokovic saved match points en route to the title, saving two against Federer in the semifinals to complete a comeback from two sets down,[149][150] thus becoming just the second player to beat Federer from two sets down after Tsonga a few months earlier in Wimbledon.[151] Djokovic's crosscourt forehand return winner to save the first match point is widely regarded as one of the greatest shots in US Open history as well as one of the greatest returns in tennis history.[152][153] This was the second consecutive US Open where Djokovic saved two match points against Federer to reach the final, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2011 U.S. Open: Novak Djokovic overcomes back pain, Rafael Nadal to win marathon match\". *The Washington Post*. 12 September 2011.

Djokovic and Murray are one of two pairs to have met in each of the four major finals (other pair being Djokovic and Nadal). The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being a week older than Djokovic. They went to training camp together, and Murray was the winner of the first match they ever played as teenagers. One of their most notable matches was a three-set thriller at the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters, in which Murray held five championship point opportunities in the second set; however, Djokovic saved each of them, forcing a deciding set.[456] He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title, ending Murray's 12–0 winning streak at the event. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic is the player with the most victories over Federer and the only player to beat Federer multiple times at his most successful major tournaments, four times at the Australian Open, three times at the US Open, three times at the Year-end Championship and most notably, three times at the final of Wimbledon Championships. Their most recent final was at the 2019 Wimbledon where Djokovic won in five sets in what became the longest final in Wimbledon history.[451][452] Other notable matches they contested are the 2014 Wimbledon and 2015 Wimbledon finals, along with semifinals at the 2010 US Open, 2011 US Open, 2011 French Open, and 2018 Paris Masters.[150][453][454]\n\n\n\n### Andy Murray[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Murray rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a triumphant grass season, Djokovic started his North American hardcourt swing with a third-round showing at the Canadian Open, losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas. Afterwards, he returned to play the Cincinnati Masters for the first time in three years. In an event plagued by suspended play due to rain, Djokovic defeated the defending champion Grigor Dimitrov, Milos Raonic, and Marin Čilić to reach his sixth final at the tournament and fourth final against Roger Federer. Although Federer was riding a streak of 100 consecutive holds of serve at the tournament,[276] dating back to the 2014 final,[277] Djokovic broke his serve three times to win his first Cincinnati Masters title. With this victory, Djokovic became the first (and, as of 2022, only) player in tennis history to complete the Career Golden Masters — winning all nine ATP Masters events at least once in one's career.[278]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** The Men's Player of the Decade: Novak Djokovic Archived 23 July 2023 at the Wayback Machine, Tennis magazine\n9. **^** \"Uncovered: The Best Seasons Of Novak Djokovic's Career\". *ATP Tour*. 31 March 2020.

The two contested in the longest major finals match ever played at the 2012 Australian Open where Djokovic won in five sets lasting 5 hours and 53 minutes.[440][441][442] Other classics they played include the 2009 Madrid Masters semifinal,[443] 2011 Miami Masters final,[444][445] the 2013 French Open semifinal,[446] 2018 Wimbledon semifinal,[447][448] and the 2021 French Open semifinal.[449]\n\n\n\n### Roger Federer[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Federer rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n479. **^** \"Australian Open 2019: Novak Djokovic beats Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to reach third round\".

At the 2018 Australian Open, he reached the fourth round, where he was upset by Chung Hyeon. In late January, he underwent surgery on his elbow.[263] On 3 March, Djokovic returned to the practice courts,[264] and surprisingly played at Indian Wells only a week later, losing in the second round to Taro Daniel.[265] He then lost to Benoît Paire in the second round of the Miami Open.[266]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith his first-round win at the Wimbledon Championships against Kwon Soon-woo, Djokovic became the first player in history (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four Grand Slams.[388] With his semifinal win over Cameron Norrie, Djokovic reached a record 32nd Grand Slam final, one ahead of Roger Federer.[389] Djokovic went on to defeat Nick Kyrgios in the final in four sets for his fourth consecutive and seventh overall Wimbledon trophy.[390]\nWith this victory, he reached a total of 21 major titles, which broke his tie of 20 majors with Federer and put him one Grand Slam title behind Nadal.[391][392]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTennis pundits have classified many of Djokovic's matches as some of the greatest contests ever, such as the 2012 Australian Open final, in which he beat Nadal in five long and gruelling sets.[537][538] Other matches include the five-set 2013 Australian Open fourth round against Stan Wawrinka,[188][189] the 2018 Wimbledon semifinal against Nadal, which lasted five brutal sets played over two days,[539][540] the five-set 2019 Wimbledon final against Roger Federer, the longest Wimbledon final in history,[541][542] and the 2023 Cincinnati Masters final against Carlos Alcaraz, the longest best-of-three-sets final in ATP Tour history.[422][423]\n\n\nSome analysts claim that the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry ranks as the best rivalry in tennis history because of the quality of matches they produce.[543]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n### Playing style[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the final Grand Slam event of the year, Djokovic had the chance to become the first man in history to complete the full set of Masters titles in Cincinnati, achieving the Career Golden Masters, but he lost the final to Federer (Djokovic would accomplish the feat at the 2018 and 2020 events).[232] At the US Open, Djokovic reached the final for the sixth time in his career, achieving the feat of reaching all four Grand Slam finals in a single calendar year. In the final, he faced Federer once again, defeating him in four sets to win his third Grand Slam title of the year, his second title at Flushing Meadows, and his tenth Grand Slam singles title overall, becoming the fifth man in the Open Era to win double-digit Grand Slam singles titles, as well as only the third man to reach all four Major finals in a calendar year.[233]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n261. **^** \"Novak Djokovic will miss the rest of 2017 season with elbow injury\". *The Guardian*. 16 July 2017.

He could not find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson agreed to make him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head.[556] After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign.[557] Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head Synthetic Leather Grip as a replacement grip.[558] In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.[559]\n\n\n\n### Coaching and personal team[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### 2008: First Major title, two Masters & first Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic started his preparations for the season by playing the Hopman Cup with fellow Serbian world No. 3 Jelena Janković where he won all of his four singles matches, including in the final against the United States, where he beat Mardy Fish in a deciding set tiebreak to level the tie, but then losing the decisive mixed doubles rubber,[88] in which he faced former WTA No. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPete Sampras declared Djokovic's 2011 season as the best he had seen in his lifetime, calling it \"one of the best achievements in all of the sports.\"[161] Boris Becker called Djokovic's season \"one of the very best years in tennis of all time\", noting that it \"may not be the best statistically, but he's beaten Federer, he's beaten Nadal, he's beaten everybody that came around to challenge him in the biggest tournaments in the world.\"[162] Rafael Nadal, who lost to Djokovic in six finals on hard, clay and grass courts, described Djokovic's performances as \"probably the highest level of tennis that I ever saw.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### 2012: Australian Open title, three Masters & Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the French Open, Djokovic advanced to the final after defeating Rafael Nadal in a four-set semifinal epic.

He won 11 titles including a season-record 10 Big Titles (three Majors, six Masters, and the Year-end Championships) on all court surfaces and conditions (hard, clay, grass and indoors). Djokovic set a season-record of 16,585 for most ranking points accumulated as world No. 1. and had a season-record 31 victories over top-10 players, including a remarkable 15–4 winning record against the other members of the Big Four, Federer, Nadal, and Murray. The 2015 season is Djokovic's most successful season as of 2022, and it is considered one of the greatest seasons in tennis history.[237]\n\n\n\n#### 2016: Historic 'Nole Slam', four Masters & ranking points record[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThey met again two months later at the Olympics, with Djokovic winning in straight sets in the quarterfinals.[476] They contested the final of the 2012 China Open, where Djokovic was victorious once again, in straight sets.[477] The pair were drawn in the same pool for the 2012 ATP Finals in which Djokovic prevailed in the first (of three) round robin matches.[478] It was Djokovic's fifth win over Tsonga in 2012. Their final major meeting was in the second round of the 2019 Australian Open,[479] which Djokovic won in straight sets.\n\n\n\n### Daniil Medvedev[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Daniil Medvedev have met 15 times, with Djokovic leading 10–5.[480][481] They have contested three major finals, with Djokovic winning the 2021 Australian Open and the 2023 US Open, and Medvedev winning his first major title at the 2021 US Open, also ending Djokovic's quest for a calendar-year Grand Slam.[482]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to Djokovic's unvaccinated status against COVID-19, he was unable to compete in the US Open as the US government did not allow unvaccinated non-US citizens to enter the country.[393] As a result, he withdrew from the tournament on 25 August.[394] At the Astana Open in October, he defeated Medvedev in the semifinals and Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final to win his 90th singles title.[395] Djokovic also qualified for the ATP Finals for the 15th time.[396][397]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic and Stan Wawrinka have met 27 times with Djokovic leading 21–6. However, the two have contested numerous close matches, including four five-setters at the majors.[459] Wawrinka and Djokovic have met in three consecutive Australian Opens – with each match going to five sets – and a five-setter in the US Open. In the 2013 Australian Open fourth round, Djokovic won 12–10 in a fifth set, with the match being considered one of the best ever played;[460][187][188][191][189][461] at the 2013 US Open semifinals Djokovic won 6–4 in the fifth set; at the 2014 Australian Open quarterfinals, Wawrinka won 9–7 in the fifth. Wawrinka's win broke Djokovic's run of 14 consecutive major semifinals, and ended a 28-match winning streak; and Wawrinka went on to win his first major title at the tournament.[462] Djokovic got revenge the next year at the 2015 Australian Open, winning 6–0 in the fifth set.[463]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic has 80% stake in biotech firm QuantBioRes which claims to be developing a drug to treat patients who have contracted COVID-19.[637] Their research is based on electromagnetic frequency; one biomedical scientist likened it to homeopathy and argued that it \"does not reflect a contemporary understanding of how biochemistry works\", while Peter Collignon commented that their website \"describes a way of finding a new molecule without providing any evidence of success\".[638]\n\n\n\n### Professional Tennis Players Association[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Djokovic resigned from the Players Council of the Association of Tennis Professionals and formed the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) with Vasek Pospisil. The pair will serve as co-presidents of the new organisation to promote the interests of male and female tennis players above a ranking of 500 in singles and 200 in doubles.[639]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic began his season by winning the Australian Open. In the quarterfinals, he defeated David Ferrer in three sets. In the semifinal, Djokovic beat Andy Murray in five sets after 4 hours and 50 minutes, recovering from a two-sets-to-one deficit and fending off break points at 5-all in the fifth set.[164] In the final, Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal in five sets, recovering from losing the first set and then a break down in the final set to win 7–5. At 5 hours and 53 minutes, the match was the longest Grand Slam final in Open Era history, as well as the longest match in Australian Open history, surpassing the 5-hour and 14-minute 2009 semifinal between Nadal and Fernando Verdasco.[165]\n\n\nDjokovic was beaten by John Isner in the semifinals at Indian Wells. He successfully defended his title in Miami after beating Murray in the final.[166] In the Monte Carlo final, he lost in straight sets to Nadal.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals, holding the ranking for a total of 16 weeks. Currently ranked world No. 3 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Medvedev has won 20 ATP Tour singles titles, including the 2021 US Open and 2020 ATP Finals. In the former, Medvedev defeated then-world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final to deny him the Grand Slam.[5] In the latter, he became the first and only player to defeat the top three ranked players in the world en route to the year-end championship title. He has also won six Masters titles, and contested five major finals. His six Masters titles all came in different venues, making him only the sixth player to win Masters titles at six different venues.Medvedev made his ATP Tour main draw debut at the singles event of the 2015 Kremlin Cup. In 2017, he participated in a major for the first time at Wimbledon, where he defeated world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka. In 2018, Medvedev won his first ATP Tour singles titles at Sydney and Winston-Salem, and his first ATP 500 title in Tokyo. He achieved a breakthrough in 2019, making his top 10 debut after Wimbledon and reaching six consecutive tournament finals, including at the US Open.[6][7] In February 2022, Medvedev became the first man outside of the Big Three to hold the world No. 1 ranking since Andy Murray, the third Russian man following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000, and the 27th man overall.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nDaniil Medvedev was born in Moscow to Sergey Medvedev and Olga Medvedeva. Daniil's father, a computer engineer, developed his own business of building materials sales, from the mid-1980s to the early 2010s.[9] Medvedev has two older sisters named Julia and Elena, 12 and 8 years his senior, respectively. When he was 6 years old, his mother noticed an advertisement for group tennis lessons at the pool where he was taking swimming lessons. His father encouraged him to enroll. Medvedev's first tennis teacher was Ekaterina Kryuchkova, a former coach of professional tennis player Vera Zvonareva among others.[10] Daniil's other childhood activities besides sport included harpsichord and guitar lessons.[11][12][13]\n\n\nMedvedev studied physics and maths at a specialized school before graduating early and enrolling in economics and commerce at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He later dropped out to focus on tennis.[13] He then switched to the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth, and Tourism, where he received his diploma as coach.[14] With his family he moved to Antibes, France where he trained at the tennis academy.[15] His parents have been living in France since then, as retirees.[12] As a result of living mostly overseas after turning 18, Medvedev can speak French and English fluently, besides his native Russian.[11]\n\n\nMedvedev married his girlfriend Daria Chernyshkova, a Moscow State University graduate and former juniors tennis player, in Moscow on 12 September 2018.[16][17] On October 14, 2022, they announced the birth of their daughter.[18]\nIn September 2019, he credited his marriage for the improvement of his tennis results: \"Before I made a proposal, I had been on the 65th place in the ranking, and then in ten months I've won two major tournaments and entered the top 10. We have significantly rebuilt our life, we work for each other. I earn [money], and Daria helps me to earn more\".[19] Daria also works as his assistant, e.g., she helps to procure travel visas, which is not easy with a Russian passport.[20] When he won the US Open on 12 September 2021, his first Grand Slam singles title, Medvedev joked, referring to the final being on the same day as his wedding anniversary, \"If I lose, I have no time to find a present. So I have to win this match.\"[21]\n\n\nMedvedev has been listed as an \"unsuitable\" subject for compulsory military service in the Russian Armed Forces because of minor health issues due to his preterm birth at 8 months.[12] Like many other Russian tennis players, Medvedev considered switching to the flag of Kazakhstan in the beginning of his professional career for a lack of support from the Russian Tennis Federation.[22][23] Sports psychologist Francisca Dauzet has been a part of his French-speaking entourage since 2018.[24] Medvedev is a supporter of FC Bayern Munich.[25]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev played his first junior match in July 2009 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Estonia.

After that, Medvedev said Young and French were friends. As both parties are black, he was disqualified mid-match for allegedly 'question[ing] the impartiality of the umpire based on her race'.[28]\n\n\n\n### 2017 First ATP final[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Medvedev reached his first ATP singles final. In the final at the Chennai Open he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in two sets. As a result, Medvedev jumped 34 positions from 99 to 65 in the ATP rankings, a new career-high.

He reached the final which he won against Australian Alex de Minaur. The final was the youngest ATP Tour tournament final since 2007, when a 20-year-old Rafael Nadal defeated a 19-year-old Novak Djokovic in the final of Indian Wells. It also was the tournament's youngest final since 1989.[32]\n\n\nIn August, Medvedev won his second ATP title at the 2018 Winston-Salem Open after defeating Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*] In October, Medvedev won his first ATP 500 and third career ATP title in Tokyo as a qualifier, overcoming Japanese star and No. 3 seeded, Kei Nishikori, in straight sets in the final.

He returned to form on the grass courts of Queen's Club, reaching his sixth semifinal of the season where he lost to Gilles Simon. Medvedev made his top 10 debut after reaching the third round of Wimbledon.\n\n\nThe North American hard-court swing proved to be a momentous breakthrough in Medvedev's career, as he reached four tournament finals (in Washington, Montreal, Cincinnati, and the US Open), becoming only the third man in tennis history to do so (after Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi).[42] In Washington, he was defeated by Nick Kyrgios in the final. He followed this up with a strong performance at the Rogers Cup, reaching his first Masters final after beating top 10 players Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov.

He led Russia to the semifinals, where they were eliminated by the Serbian team after Medvedev lost to world No. 2 Novak Djokovic.[58] At the Australian Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by former champion Stan Wawrinka in five sets. During the February indoor season, Medvedev suffered early defeats in Rotterdam and Marseille.\n\n\nWhen the season resumed in August after a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Medvedev failed to defend his title at Cincinnati Masters, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in the quarterfinals. As the 3rd seed in the US Open, Medvedev reached the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Dominic Thiem.[59] At the French Open, Medvedev exited the tournament in the first round for the fourth consecutive year, losing to Márton Fucsovics. His struggles with form continued into the October indoor season, failing to string together more than two consecutive match wins in the St. Petersburg Open and Vienna Opens. Medvedev then resurged, winning his first title in a year at the Paris Masters.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals, Medvedev won all his round-robin matches in straight sets, over Alexander Zverev, Novak Djokovic and Diego Schwartzman. Medvedev recovered from a set- and break-deficit to defeat Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, before beating Dominic Thiem in the final, once again coming from a set down.[62] With the victory, he became the first player to have defeated the world's top three players at the ATP Finals, and only the fourth player (after Djokovic, Boris Becker, and David Nalbandian) to have done so at any tournament since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### 2021 US Open, Davis and ATP Cups champion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nAt the second edition of the ATP Cup in February, Medvedev led Russia to the title, going 4–0 in singles.

At Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round for the first time in his career.[70] There, he lost to Hubert Hurkacz in a match plagued by rain delays.[71] Medvedev entered both the men's singles and the men's doubles events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. In doubles, Medvedev and Aslan Karatsev were defeated in the first round by Slovakia's Filip Polášek and Lukáš Klein. In singles, he defeated Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, India's Sumit Nagal, and Italy's Fabio Fognini to reach the quarterfinals.[72][73] In the quarterfinals, he lost to Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta.[74] To start the North American hardcourt season, Medvedev competed at the Canadian Open, where he won the title by defeating Reilly Opelka in the final.[75] The following week, he competed at the Cincinnati Masters, reaching the semifinals where he was defeated by Andrey Rublev.[76]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Medvedev dropped just one set en route to his first major title, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.[77][78][79] The final received immense attention, as Djokovic was vying to become only the second man in the Open Era to achieve the calendar-year Grand Slam.[80]\n\n\nFollowing the US Open, Medvedev participated in the Laver Cup as part of Team Europe. Team Europe comfortably won the title, with Medvedev winning his match against Denis Shapovalov in straight sets.

Russia advanced to the semifinals of the tournament after Medvedev and Roman Safiullin went undefeated in doubles. There, Medvedev won his singles match against Canada's Félix Auger-Aliassime, but Russia was eliminated when Medvedev and Safiullin were defeated in the decisive doubles rubber.[85]\n\n\nIn January, Medvedev reached the final of the Australian Open for the second successive year. En route to the final, he beat home favorite Nick Kyrgios, world No. 10 Auger-Aliassime (saving match point), and world No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas.

At 5 hours and 24 minutes, it was the second longest Major final ever played.[86] In February, Medvedev was nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year award.[87]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the Mexican Open with the opportunity to gain the world number 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic. Medvedev reached the semifinals where he was defeated once again by Rafael Nadal in a rematch of the Australian Open final.[88] However, as Djokovic was also defeated in the Dubai quarterfinals being played simultaneously, Medvedev ascended to world number 1 for the first time. Medvedev thus became the first man outside of the Big Four to hold the top ranking since Andy Roddick in February 2004,[89] and the third Russian man to achieve the ranking, following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000.[90]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev lost to Gael Monfils in the third round. The loss resulted in his losing the number 1 ranking, with Novak Djokovic once again taking the top spot.[91] Medvedev had a chance to reclaim the number 1 ranking the following fortnight if he reached the semifinals at the Miami Masters, but fell one match short, losing to defending champion Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinals.[92]\n\n\nOn April 2, Medvedev announced that he would miss the beginning of the clay court season to recover from a hernia procedure.[93] On April 20, the All England Club announced a ban on all Russian and Belarusian players, including Medvedev, from competing at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[94]\n\n\nFollowing his recovery from surgery, Medvedev returned to play at the Geneva Open, where he lost his opening match to Richard Gasquet in straight sets.[95] At the French Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by Marin Čilić.[96] However, as Novak Djokovic failed to defend his title, Medvedev reclaimed the number 1 ranking.[97]\n\n\nMedvedev entered three tournaments in the grass court season, Rosmalen, Halle, and Mallorca.

This resulted in him dropping to world no. 7 in the year-end rankings.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Three consecutive titles, 300th win, 20th career title, US Open finalist[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev started the season at the Adelaide International where he reached the semifinals, losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[109] Seeded 7th at the Australian Open, he defeated opponents Marcos Giron and John Millman before losing to Sebastian Korda in straight sets in the third round.

Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their last seven.[124]\n\n\n\n### Alexander Zverev[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Zverev rivalry\n\nMedvedev and Zverev have faced each other 18 times with Medvedev leading the rivalry 11–7. Zverev won the first four matches of their rivalry, but Medvedev won ten of the last twelve of their encounters.[125]\n\n\n\n### Nadal and Djokovic[edit]\n\n\nOf his five major finals, Medvedev has twice faced Rafael Nadal (at the 2019 US Open and 2022 Australian Open) and thrice faced Novak Djokovic (at 2021 Australian Open, 2021 US Open, and 2023 US Open). His lone victory in major finals came at the 2021 US Open, where he defeated Djokovic in straight sets to win his first major title and deny Djokovic the Grand Slam. The following year, at the 2022 Australian Open, he was aiming to become the first man in the Open Era to win his second major title directly after the first, but lost to Nadal in an epic five-set match despite being two sets up.\n\n\nOverall, Medvedev's head-to-head against the two all-time greats is 1–5 against Nadal, and 5–10 against Djokovic.\n\n\n\n## Playing style and mentality[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is a counterpuncher. Standing at 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) tall, he has an very powerful first serve capable of reaching 148 mph (232 km/h). He hits long, flat groundstrokes, often wearing opponents down with lengthy baseline rallies. Medvedev's biggest weapon is his ability to play consistently. He has not thrived on power and spin but has been able to land the ball between the lines over and over again.[126]\n\n\nMedvedev is also known for his strong return of serve. He tends to adopt a very deep position at the back of the court which allows him to hit full-swing groundstrokes rather than blocking the serve back into play.[127] He also possesses one of the best backhands on tour. His forehand is generally the weaker shot of the two. He is known for his very defensive play. Medvedev is a moderately strong competitor mentally, evident in his attitude on the court, playing style, and demeanor in big matches.[126] According to Francisca Dauzet, the performance coach he has been working with since 2018, he has “monstrous mental potential” and is learning to control his impatience. He has at times been “unable to channel his outbursts”, but Dauzet describes him as a quick learner who is \"fast at catching things\".[128]\n\n\nMedvedev's preferred surface is hardcourt and he has been one of the very best and most consistent players on the surface since he first broke through to the top 10 in 2019. He struggles much more on clay due to his extremely flat strokes and the fact that his movement, one of his biggest strengths on a hardcourt, is hampered. He has still achieved solid results on the surface.\n\n\nWith his playing style, Novak Djokovic has described Medvedev as a very complete player and in October 2019 Alexander Zverev called him the best player in the world. 2019 ATP Finals champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas, once described his way of playing as \"very boring\"; but later said \"he just plays extremely smart and outplays you\".[129][130][131][132]\n\n\nMedvedev has sometimes had an antagonistic relationship with crowds. In the 2023 US Open Medvedev lashed out at the crowd, asking if they were stupid and asking them to shut up.[133]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is endorsed by Lacoste for apparel and shoes, Tecnifibre for racquets, and Bovet for watches.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals, holding the ranking for a total of 16 weeks. Currently ranked world No. 3 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Medvedev has won 20 ATP Tour singles titles, including the 2021 US Open and 2020 ATP Finals. In the former, Medvedev defeated then-world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final to deny him the Grand Slam.[5] In the latter, he became the first and only player to defeat the top three ranked players in the world en route to the year-end championship title. He has also won six Masters titles, and contested five major finals. His six Masters titles all came in different venues, making him only the sixth player to win Masters titles at six different venues.Medvedev made his ATP Tour main draw debut at the singles event of the 2015 Kremlin Cup. In 2017, he participated in a major for the first time at Wimbledon, where he defeated world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka. In 2018, Medvedev won his first ATP Tour singles titles at Sydney and Winston-Salem, and his first ATP 500 title in Tokyo. He achieved a breakthrough in 2019, making his top 10 debut after Wimbledon and reaching six consecutive tournament finals, including at the US Open.[6][7] In February 2022, Medvedev became the first man outside of the Big Three to hold the world No. 1 ranking since Andy Murray, the third Russian man following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000, and the 27th man overall.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nDaniil Medvedev was born in Moscow to Sergey Medvedev and Olga Medvedeva. Daniil's father, a computer engineer, developed his own business of building materials sales, from the mid-1980s to the early 2010s.[9] Medvedev has two older sisters named Julia and Elena, 12 and 8 years his senior, respectively. When he was 6 years old, his mother noticed an advertisement for group tennis lessons at the pool where he was taking swimming lessons. His father encouraged him to enroll. Medvedev's first tennis teacher was Ekaterina Kryuchkova, a former coach of professional tennis player Vera Zvonareva among others.[10] Daniil's other childhood activities besides sport included harpsichord and guitar lessons.[11][12][13]\n\n\nMedvedev studied physics and maths at a specialized school before graduating early and enrolling in economics and commerce at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He later dropped out to focus on tennis.[13] He then switched to the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth, and Tourism, where he received his diploma as coach.[14] With his family he moved to Antibes, France where he trained at the tennis academy.[15] His parents have been living in France since then, as retirees.[12] As a result of living mostly overseas after turning 18, Medvedev can speak French and English fluently, besides his native Russian.[11]\n\n\nMedvedev married his girlfriend Daria Chernyshkova, a Moscow State University graduate and former juniors tennis player, in Moscow on 12 September 2018.[16][17] On October 14, 2022, they announced the birth of their daughter.[18]\nIn September 2019, he credited his marriage for the improvement of his tennis results: \"Before I made a proposal, I had been on the 65th place in the ranking, and then in ten months I've won two major tournaments and entered the top 10. We have significantly rebuilt our life, we work for each other. I earn [money], and Daria helps me to earn more\".[19] Daria also works as his assistant, e.g., she helps to procure travel visas, which is not easy with a Russian passport.[20] When he won the US Open on 12 September 2021, his first Grand Slam singles title, Medvedev joked, referring to the final being on the same day as his wedding anniversary, \"If I lose, I have no time to find a present. So I have to win this match.\"[21]\n\n\nMedvedev has been listed as an \"unsuitable\" subject for compulsory military service in the Russian Armed Forces because of minor health issues due to his preterm birth at 8 months.[12] Like many other Russian tennis players, Medvedev considered switching to the flag of Kazakhstan in the beginning of his professional career for a lack of support from the Russian Tennis Federation.[22][23] Sports psychologist Francisca Dauzet has been a part of his French-speaking entourage since 2018.[24] Medvedev is a supporter of FC Bayern Munich.[25]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev played his first junior match in July 2009 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Estonia. In December 2010, he won his first junior title as a qualifier at just his third tournament.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n2012–2013 would see Medvedev surge on the junior circuit as he won six titles between October 2012 and July 2013 which included four consecutive titles. He made his junior Grand Slam debut at 2013 Junior Wimbledon where he won his first round match against Hong Seong-chan but lost in the second round to 2nd seed Nikola Milojević. At the 2013 Junior US Open, he went into the tournament seeded 10th and made the third round where he lost to Johan Tatlot.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev reached his career-high junior ranking of world No. 13 at the beginning of 2014 and went into the 2014 Junior Australian Open seeded 8th. He ended his junior career after a first round loss at 2014 Junior Wimbledon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev ended his junior career with an overall win–loss record of 109–43 and wins over several future stars including Alexander Zverev and Reilly Opelka.[26]\n\n\nJunior Grand Slam results – singles:\n\n\nAustralian Open: 3R (2014)  \n\nFrench Open: 3R (2014)  \n\nWimbledon: 2R (2013)  \n\nUS Open: 3R (2013)\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2016 Early pro career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev made his ATP main draw debut at the 2015 Kremlin Cup, partnering Aslan Karatsev in the doubles event. The two defeated Aliaksandr Bury and Denis Istomin in the first round but were defeated by Radu Albot and František Čermák in the second round.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2015 Nice Open\nAs a qualifier, Medvedev made his ATP singles main draw debut at the 2016 Nice Open, losing to Guido Pella in three sets. Three weeks later he earned his first singles ATP World Tour win at the 2016 Ricoh Open, defeating Horacio Zeballos in straight sets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev was disqualified from the second round of the Savannah Challenger event (in Georgia, U.S.) for comments he made after the umpire ruled in favor of his opponent.[27] Medvedev thought he had won a break point against his opponent Donald Young's serve, but chair umpire Sandy French ruled that his returning shot had gone out. After that, Medvedev said Young and French were friends. As both parties are black, he was disqualified mid-match for allegedly 'question[ing] the impartiality of the umpire based on her race'.[28]\n\n\n\n### 2017 First ATP final[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Medvedev reached his first ATP singles final. In the final at the Chennai Open he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in two sets. As a result, Medvedev jumped 34 positions from 99 to 65 in the ATP rankings, a new career-high. In February, he advanced to the quarterfinals of both the Open Sud de France and the Open 13, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Lucas Pouille respectively.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn June, he made it to the quarterfinals of the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships, defeating the 6th seed, Robin Haase, and Thanasi Kokkinakis before losing to Ivo Karlović in straight sets. At the Aegon Championships, he advanced to his first ATP 500 quarterfinal by beating Nicolas Mahut and Kokkinakis in the first two rounds, before losing to the No. 6 seed, Grigor Dimitrov, in the quarterfinals. One week later, he on grass advanced to the semifinal of Eastbourne International, losing to Novak Djokovic.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev registered his maiden Grand Slam match win at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, defeating fifth seed and world No. 3, Stan Wawrinka, in the first round in four sets.[29] He lost in the next round to Ruben Bemelmans.[30] Medvedev was handed three fines totaling $14,500 (£11,200) for his conduct during the match with Bemelmans: $7,000 for insulting the umpire on two occasions and $7,500 for throwing coins under the umpire's chair.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev serving at the 2017 Queen's Club Championships\n### 2018 First ATP titles[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the 2018 season by qualifying for the Sydney International. He reached the final which he won against Australian Alex de Minaur. The final was the youngest ATP Tour tournament final since 2007, when a 20-year-old Rafael Nadal defeated a 19-year-old Novak Djokovic in the final of Indian Wells. It also was the tournament's youngest final since 1989.[32]\n\n\nIn August, Medvedev won his second ATP title at the 2018 Winston-Salem Open after defeating Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*] In October, Medvedev won his first ATP 500 and third career ATP title in Tokyo as a qualifier, overcoming Japanese star and No. 3 seeded, Kei Nishikori, in straight sets in the final. This triumph brought him to a new career high ranking of No. 22 and made him the No. 1 player in Russia. The victory also marked the third consecutive final that Medvedev had beaten the home favorite in to win the title. Medvedev reached the Kremlin Cup semifinal, losing to his countryman and eventual champion Karen Khachanov. One week later, he made the semifinals at the ATP 500 Swiss Indoors event, which he lost to Roger Federer. After the tournament, he achieved a new career high ranking of world No. 16.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev finished 2018 with the most hard court match wins of any player on the ATP Tour (38 wins). He also had the most titles on hard court tournaments (3 titles), tying with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Karen Khachanov.[33]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Two Masters titles, US Open final[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the season strongly by reaching the final of the Brisbane International, defeating Andy Murray, Milos Raonic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga en route, but then lost to Kei Nishikori.[34] At the Australian Open, he was seeded 15th, the first time he was seeded at a major. He reached the round of 16 for the first time in his career, where he was defeated by eventual champion Novak Djokovic.[35] In February, Medvedev won his fourth ATP title at the Sofia Open, beating Márton Fucsovics in the final.[36] The following week, Medvedev lost in the semifinals of Rotterdam to Gaël Monfils. Medvedev entered the Monte Carlo Masters having only won two of his 13 career matches on clay courts. Despite this, he reached his first ever Masters 1000 quarterfinal at the event after defeating world No. 8 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[37] In the quarterfinals, Medvedev earned his first triumph over a world number 1 ranked player, when he defeated Djokovic in three sets.[38] His run ended in the semifinals against Dušan Lajović.[39] At the Barcelona Open, Medvedev earned his third successive top 10 victory (this time over Kei Nishikori) to reach his first clay-court final.[40] There, he was defeated by world No. 5 Dominic Thiem.[41] Following his victory over Nishikori, Medvedev experienced a five-match losing streak, including an opening-round defeat at the French Open. He returned to form on the grass courts of Queen's Club, reaching his sixth semifinal of the season where he lost to Gilles Simon. Medvedev made his top 10 debut after reaching the third round of Wimbledon.\n\n\nThe North American hard-court swing proved to be a momentous breakthrough in Medvedev's career, as he reached four tournament finals (in Washington, Montreal, Cincinnati, and the US Open), becoming only the third man in tennis history to do so (after Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi).[42] In Washington, he was defeated by Nick Kyrgios in the final. He followed this up with a strong performance at the Rogers Cup, reaching his first Masters final after beating top 10 players Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov. In the final, he was defeated by defending champion Rafael Nadal. Medvedev would reach a second consecutive Masters final at Cincinnati after beating defending champion Djokovic for the second time, where he defeated David Goffin in straight sets for his first Masters title.[43]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the US Open as the world No. 5.[44] In his second round match, he fought off cramping to defeat Hugo Dellien in four sets.[45] He then defeated Feliciano López in a contentious match for which he was fined $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and $4,000 for flipping off the crowd.[46][47] Medvedev next recovered from a set and a break deficit to beat Dominik Köpfer and reach his first Major quarterfinal.[48] He then beat former champion Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals and Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals to reach his first Grand Slam final.[49][50] There, Medvedev was defeated by Rafael Nadal in five sets.[51]\n\n\nMedvedev followed up his success in North America with his maiden title on Russian soil at the St. Petersburg Open, to become the first Russian to win the tournament in 15 years.[52][53] Medvedev then won a second consecutive title at the Shanghai Masters, defeating Alexander Zverev in the final.[54] By reaching the final, Medvedev became the 7th man since 2000 to reach at least nine finals in a season.[55][56][57] He ended the season losing his last four matches, including all three round robin matches in his ATP Finals debut.\n\n\n\n### 2020 ATP Finals champion, third Masters title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2020 Australian Open\nMedvedev opened his season at the inaugural edition of the ATP Cup as Russia's top ranked singles player. He led Russia to the semifinals, where they were eliminated by the Serbian team after Medvedev lost to world No. 2 Novak Djokovic.[58] At the Australian Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by former champion Stan Wawrinka in five sets. During the February indoor season, Medvedev suffered early defeats in Rotterdam and Marseille.\n\n\nWhen the season resumed in August after a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Medvedev failed to defend his title at Cincinnati Masters, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in the quarterfinals. As the 3rd seed in the US Open, Medvedev reached the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Dominic Thiem.[59] At the French Open, Medvedev exited the tournament in the first round for the fourth consecutive year, losing to Márton Fucsovics. His struggles with form continued into the October indoor season, failing to string together more than two consecutive match wins in the St. Petersburg Open and Vienna Opens. Medvedev then resurged, winning his first title in a year at the Paris Masters.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals, Medvedev won all his round-robin matches in straight sets, over Alexander Zverev, Novak Djokovic and Diego Schwartzman. Medvedev recovered from a set- and break-deficit to defeat Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, before beating Dominic Thiem in the final, once again coming from a set down.[62] With the victory, he became the first player to have defeated the world's top three players at the ATP Finals, and only the fourth player (after Djokovic, Boris Becker, and David Nalbandian) to have done so at any tournament since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### 2021 US Open, Davis and ATP Cups champion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nAt the second edition of the ATP Cup in February, Medvedev led Russia to the title, going 4–0 in singles. This included 3 top ten victories (over Diego Schwartzman, Alexander Zverev, and Matteo Berrettini) extending his win streak over top 10 opponents to ten wins.[65] Medvedev then reached his second Grand Slam final at the Australian Open after straight sets victories over Andrey Rublev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, extending his win streak against top 10 opponents to twelve wins, and his overall win streak to twenty wins. In the final, he was defeated by the defending champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[66]\n\n\nMedvedev won his first title of the season at the Open 13 in Marseille, defeating Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the final.[67] With the win, Medvedev ascended to world number 2 in the ATP rankings, becoming the first man outside of the Big Four to occupy a position in the top 2 since Lleyton Hewitt in July 2005.[68] On 13 April, Medvedev tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to withdraw from the 2021 Monte-Carlo Masters.[69] At the French Open, Medvedev reached the quarterfinals, where he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the grass-court season, Medvedev took a wildcard to play in the Mallorca Championships, where he won his first career grass-court title. At Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round for the first time in his career.[70] There, he lost to Hubert Hurkacz in a match plagued by rain delays.[71] Medvedev entered both the men's singles and the men's doubles events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. In doubles, Medvedev and Aslan Karatsev were defeated in the first round by Slovakia's Filip Polášek and Lukáš Klein. In singles, he defeated Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, India's Sumit Nagal, and Italy's Fabio Fognini to reach the quarterfinals.[72][73] In the quarterfinals, he lost to Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta.[74] To start the North American hardcourt season, Medvedev competed at the Canadian Open, where he won the title by defeating Reilly Opelka in the final.[75] The following week, he competed at the Cincinnati Masters, reaching the semifinals where he was defeated by Andrey Rublev.[76]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Medvedev dropped just one set en route to his first major title, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.[77][78][79] The final received immense attention, as Djokovic was vying to become only the second man in the Open Era to achieve the calendar-year Grand Slam.[80]\n\n\nFollowing the US Open, Medvedev participated in the Laver Cup as part of Team Europe. Team Europe comfortably won the title, with Medvedev winning his match against Denis Shapovalov in straight sets. At the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev was upset in the fourth round by Grigor Dimitrov.[81] At the Paris Masters, Medvedev reached the final for the second consecutive year, but lost to Novak Djokovic in three sets.[82] In his third ATP Finals, Medvedev qualified for the semifinals after winning all of his group matches. He there defeated Casper Ruud, but lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the final.[83] Medvedev ended his 2021 season by leading Russia to the Davis Cup title, not dropping a set through his five singles matches.[84]\n\n\n\n### 2022 Australian Open final, world No. 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev represented Russia in the third edition of the ATP Cup. Russia advanced to the semifinals of the tournament after Medvedev and Roman Safiullin went undefeated in doubles. There, Medvedev won his singles match against Canada's Félix Auger-Aliassime, but Russia was eliminated when Medvedev and Safiullin were defeated in the decisive doubles rubber.[85]\n\n\nIn January, Medvedev reached the final of the Australian Open for the second successive year. En route to the final, he beat home favorite Nick Kyrgios, world No. 10 Auger-Aliassime (saving match point), and world No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas. In the final, he was defeated in five epic sets by Rafael Nadal despite taking a two-set lead. At 5 hours and 24 minutes, it was the second longest Major final ever played.[86] In February, Medvedev was nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year award.[87]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the Mexican Open with the opportunity to gain the world number 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic. Medvedev reached the semifinals where he was defeated once again by Rafael Nadal in a rematch of the Australian Open final.[88] However, as Djokovic was also defeated in the Dubai quarterfinals being played simultaneously, Medvedev ascended to world number 1 for the first time. Medvedev thus became the first man outside of the Big Four to hold the top ranking since Andy Roddick in February 2004,[89] and the third Russian man to achieve the ranking, following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000.[90]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev lost to Gael Monfils in the third round. The loss resulted in his losing the number 1 ranking, with Novak Djokovic once again taking the top spot.[91] Medvedev had a chance to reclaim the number 1 ranking the following fortnight if he reached the semifinals at the Miami Masters, but fell one match short, losing to defending champion Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinals.[92]\n\n\nOn April 2, Medvedev announced that he would miss the beginning of the clay court season to recover from a hernia procedure.[93] On April 20, the All England Club announced a ban on all Russian and Belarusian players, including Medvedev, from competing at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[94]\n\n\nFollowing his recovery from surgery, Medvedev returned to play at the Geneva Open, where he lost his opening match to Richard Gasquet in straight sets.[95] At the French Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by Marin Čilić.[96] However, as Novak Djokovic failed to defend his title, Medvedev reclaimed the number 1 ranking.[97]\n\n\nMedvedev entered three tournaments in the grass court season, Rosmalen, Halle, and Mallorca. At his first event in Rosmalen, he reached the final without dropping a set before suffering a shock loss to world No. 205 Tim van Rijthoven.[98][99] He then reached the final at Halle, once again without dropping a set, where he lost to Hubert Hurkacz.[100][101] In Mallorca, Medvedev was defeated in the quarterfinals by Roberto Bautista Agut.[102]\n\n\nMedvedev started his North American summer hardcourt season by winning the title at the Los Cabos Open defeating Cameron Norrie in the final.[103] In his opening round match against Rinky Hijikata, he recorded his 250th career singles match win.[104] At the Canadian Open, Medvedev, who was the defending champion, lost his opening match to Nick Kyrgios. At the Cincinnati Masters, Medvedev was defeated by Stefanos Tsitsipas in the semifinals. Medvedev was yet again defeated by Kyrgios at the US Open, resulting in Medvedev losing his number one ranking.[105]\n\n\nMedvedev began the fall indoor-hardcourt season by competing at the Moselle Open, where he lost his opening match to Stan Wawrinka in three sets. Medvedev next competed at the Astana Open where he reached the semifinals. In his semifinal match, against Novak Djokovic, Medvedev was forced to retire with the match level at one-set-all with a leg injury.[106][107] Medvedev returned to play at the Vienna Open where he defeated Denis Shapovalov in the final to win his second title of the year, and second ATP 500 title of his career.[108] Medvedev finished the year on a 4 match losing skid, losing in the opening round in Paris Masters, and losing all three of his round robin matches in the ATP Finals in third-set tiebreakers. This resulted in him dropping to world no. 7 in the year-end rankings.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Three consecutive titles, 300th win, 20th career title, US Open finalist[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev started the season at the Adelaide International where he reached the semifinals, losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[109] Seeded 7th at the Australian Open, he defeated opponents Marcos Giron and John Millman before losing to Sebastian Korda in straight sets in the third round. As a result, Medvedev dropped out of the Top 10 to World No. 12.\n\n\nIn February, Medvedev entered the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam seeded 6th, where he made it to the finals whilst dropping only one set. In the final, he defeated Italian No. 1 Jannik Sinner in three sets,[110] thus returning back to the Top 10. The following week, Medvedev entered the Qatar ExxonMobil Open seeded third and won the tournament, defeating Andy Murray in straight sets in the final.\n\n\nIn March, Medvedev defeated No. 2 seed Andrey Rublev in straight sets in an all-Russian final to win in Dubai his third title in three weeks,[111] and his 18th title overall thus winning titles in 18 different cities and becoming the first man in the Open Era to accomplish the feat.[112] In this tournament, he did not drop a set including his win against No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic, snapping his 20-match winning streak.[113] As a result he moved back to world No. 6 on 6 March 2023.\n\n\nAt the next Masters 1000 Indian Wells Masters he reached back-to-back quarterfinals defeating 12th seed Alexander Zverev. His victories against 23rd seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and 14h seed Frances Tiafoe propelled him into the final.[114] In the final, he lost to Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets but reentered the Top 5.[115] In Miami he reached back-to-back finals defeating 14th seed Karen Khachanov and won his 19th title in a 19th different city defeating tenth seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets. He moved to world No. 4 in the rankings on 3 April 2023.[116]\n\n\nMedvedev began his clay court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters, where he reached his sixth consecutive quarterfinal with wins over Lorenzo Sonego and 13th seed Alexander Zverev but he lost to sixth seed Holger Rune in the quarterfinals, ending his streak of five consecutive finals.\nAt the next Masters in Madrid he recorded his 300th win over first-time qualifier and compatriot Alexander Shevchenko in the third round.[117] He lost to qualifier, another compatriot Aslan Karatsev in the fourth round. In Rome he reached the semifinals at a Masters 1000 clay-court event for just the second time (after Monte-Carlo 2019) defeating qualifier Yannick Hanfmann.[118] Next he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach only his second final on clay. He won his first clay title defeating Holger Rune, having won 20 titles in 20 different cities. As a result he returned to world No. 2 in the singles rankings on 22 May 2023.[119] Medvedev entered the French Open as the second seed but lost in his first round match against Thiago Seyboth Wild.\n\n\nAt the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, he was seeded 3rd and reached the semifinals for the first time at this Major. Following wins over wildcard Arthur Fery, Adrian Mannarino, Márton Fucsovics, Jiří Lehečka, and Christopher Eubanks in a tight five set match, he set up a semifinal clash with Carlos Alcaraz but lost in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the US Summer Hard Court Swing, Medvedev made the quarterfinals at the Rogers Cup and reached the fourth round at the Cincinnati Masters, losing to Alex De Minaur and Alexander Zverev respectively.[120] Next, at the 2023 US Open, he reached the final following wins over Attila Balazs, Christopher O'Connell, Sebastian Baez, Alex De Minaur, fellow countryman Andrey Rublev, and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals to set up a rematch of the 2021 final with Novak Djokovic. Djokovic won in straight sets on Sunday, September 10. Due to his US Open run, he was the third player to qualify for the 2023 ATP Finals on September 5.[121]\n\n\nAt the Asian Swing, Medvedev reached the final of the China Open where he lost Jannik Sinner straight sets. [122] At the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he recorded his 60th win of the season to reach the third round over Cristian Garin, after Carlos Alcaraz did the same.[123]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tennis rivalries\n\n### Stefanos Tsitsipas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Tsitsipas rivalry\n\nDaniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Medvedev leading the rivalry, 9–4. Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their last seven.[124]\n\n\n\n### Alexander Zverev[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Zverev rivalry\n\nMedvedev and Zverev have faced each other 18 times with Medvedev leading the rivalry 11–7. Zverev won the first four matches of their rivalry, but Medvedev won ten of the last twelve of their encounters.[125]\n\n\n\n### Nadal and Djokovic[edit]\n\n\nOf his five major finals, Medvedev has twice faced Rafael Nadal (at the 2019 US Open and 2022 Australian Open) and thrice faced Novak Djokovic (at 2021 Australian Open, 2021 US Open, and 2023 US Open). His lone victory in major finals came at the 2021 US Open, where he defeated Djokovic in straight sets to win his first major title and deny Djokovic the Grand Slam. The following year, at the 2022 Australian Open, he was aiming to become the first man in the Open Era to win his second major title directly after the first, but lost to Nadal in an epic five-set match despite being two sets up.\n\n\nOverall, Medvedev's head-to-head against the two all-time greats is 1–5 against Nadal, and 5–10 against Djokovic.\n\n\n\n## Playing style and mentality[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is a counterpuncher. Standing at 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) tall, he has an very powerful first serve capable of reaching 148 mph (232 km/h). He hits long, flat groundstrokes, often wearing opponents down with lengthy baseline rallies. Medvedev's biggest weapon is his ability to play consistently. He has not thrived on power and spin but has been able to land the ball between the lines over and over again.[126]\n\n\nMedvedev is also known for his strong return of serve. He tends to adopt a very deep position at the back of the court which allows him to hit full-swing groundstrokes rather than blocking the serve back into play.[127] He also possesses one of the best backhands on tour. His forehand is generally the weaker shot of the two. He is known for his very defensive play. Medvedev is a moderately strong competitor mentally, evident in his attitude on the court, playing style, and demeanor in big matches.[126] According to Francisca Dauzet, the performance coach he has been working with since 2018, he has “monstrous mental potential” and is learning to control his impatience. He has at times been “unable to channel his outbursts”, but Dauzet describes him as a quick learner who is \"fast at catching things\".[128]\n\n\nMedvedev's preferred surface is hardcourt and he has been one of the very best and most consistent players on the surface since he first broke through to the top 10 in 2019. He struggles much more on clay due to his extremely flat strokes and the fact that his movement, one of his biggest strengths on a hardcourt, is hampered. He has still achieved solid results on the surface.\n\n\nWith his playing style, Novak Djokovic has described Medvedev as a very complete player and in October 2019 Alexander Zverev called him the best player in the world. 2019 ATP Finals champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas, once described his way of playing as \"very boring\"; but later said \"he just plays extremely smart and outplays you\".[129][130][131][132]\n\n\nMedvedev has sometimes had an antagonistic relationship with crowds. In the 2023 US Open Medvedev lashed out at the crowd, asking if they were stupid and asking them to shut up.[133]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is endorsed by Lacoste for apparel and shoes, Tecnifibre for racquets, and Bovet for watches. He also has been employed as an ambassador by BMW, Tinkoff Bank, and HyperX for gaming accessories, mostly for the Russian-speaking world. He was previously endorsed by Lotto for apparel and shoes until 2019.[134][135] Since November 2021, he has been signed as a promoter of the Guojiao 1573 brand.[136]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daniil Medvedev career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 1R | 2R | 4R | 4R | F | F | 3R |  | 0 / 7\n | 21–7\n | 75%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | 1R | 1R | 1R | 1R | QF | 4R | 1R |  | 0 / 7\n | 7–7\n | 50%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q3 | 2R | 3R | 3R | NH\n | 4R | A[a] | SF |  | 0 / 5\n | 13–5\n | 72%\n |\n| US Open | Q1 | 1R | 3R | F | SF | **W** | 4R | F |  | 1 / 7\n | 29–6\n | 83%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 1–4\n | 5–4\n | 11–4\n | 8–3\n | 20–3\n | 12–3\n | 13–4\n |  | 1 / 26\n | 70–25\n | 74%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Finals: 5 (1 title, 4 runners-ups)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2019 | US Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 5–7, 3–6, 7–5, 6–4, 4–6\n |\n| Loss | 2021 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 5–7, 2–6, 2–6\n |\n| Win | 2021 | US Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 6–4, 6–4, 6–4\n |\n| Loss | 2022 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 6–2, 7–6(7–5), 4–6, 4–6, 5–7 |\n| Loss | 2023 | US Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 6–7(5–7), 3–6\n |\n\n\n### Year-end championship finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles 2 (1 title, 1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win\n | 2020 | ATP Finals, London\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 4–6, 7–6(7–2), 6–4\n |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Germany](image) Alexander Zverev | 4–6, 4–6\n |\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\n* These records were attained in the Open Era.\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | 4 consecutive finals of the North American swing/US Open Series | Ivan LendlAndre Agassi[42] |\n| 2020\n | Defeated the world No. 1, 2, and 3 in one tournament | Boris BeckerNovak DjokovicDavid Nalbandian |\n| 2020\n | Defeated the world No. 1, 2, and 3 to win the ATP Finals | **Stands alone**[138] |\n| 2021\n | Winner of the two premier team competitions (ATP Cup & Davis Cup) in a single season | Andrey RublevFélix Auger-Aliassime |\n| 2021\n | Undefeated winner of the two premier team competitions (ATP Cup & Davis Cup) in a single season\n | **Stands alone** |\n| 2021\n | Tallest Grand Slam champion (6'6\" – 2021 US Open) | Juan Martín del PotroMarin Čilić[139] |\n| 2022\n | Tallest World number 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| 2023\n | Winner of his first 20 tour-level titles in 20 different cities | **Stands alone**[140] |\n| 2023\n | Winner of both the Miami Open and Italian Open in the same season\n | Andre AgassiNovak Djokovic |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External image |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) Medvedev's parents, Sergey and Olga in 2019, receive the Russian Cup[141] |\n\n\nNational\n* The Russian Cup in the nominations:\n\t+ Male Tennis Player of the Year: 2019, 2021;\n\t+ Team of the Year: 2019, 2021.[141]\n* ![](image) Sports title \"Merited Master of Sports of Russia\" (2019)[142]\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Russian athletes were banned from competing following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[137][94]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Daniil Medvedev\". *ATP World Tour*.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 4 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), making him the highest-ranked male Danish player in the history of the ATP rankings.[3]Rune has won four ATP Tour singles titles, including a Masters 1000 title at the 2022 Paris Masters, and produced his best Grand Slam performance at the 2022 French Open by reaching the quarterfinals in his main draw debut at the tournament. As a junior, Rune was ranked as high as world No. 1 and won ten titles on the ITF Junior Circuit, including the 2019 French Open boys' title. After turning professional in 2020, he won five titles on the ITF World Tennis Tour and five on the ATP Challenger Tour and made his top 100 debut in the 2022.Three months later, Rune reached his first ATP Tour final at the 2022 Bavarian International Tennis Championships, where he won his first title and subsequently entered the top 50. By winning the Paris Masters later that year, Rune made his top 10 debut and became the first player on record (since the ATP rankings began in 1973) to beat five top-10 opponents at the same event outside the ATP Finals.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nRune was born on 29 April 2003 in Gentofte, Denmark, to Aneke Rune and Anders Nødskov. He has a sister named Alma. He began playing tennis at the age of 6 because his sister played and he started to take the sport seriously. Throughout his childhood, he was coached by Lars Christensen, and along with his mother, he is credited as his biggest inspiration.[3] His idols growing up were fellow tennis players Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.[6]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, he became Danish U12 champion in mixed doubles with Clara Tauson.[7]\n\n\nHe started training at the Mouratoglou Academy in 2016.[8]\n\n\nIn 2017, he won the European U14 singles championship.[9]\n\n\nAt age 15, he became the youngest Danish male singles champion by winning the 2019 indoor tournament.[10]\n\n\nOn 8 June 2019 Rune defeated Toby Alex Kodat to win the 2019 French Open boys' singles title.\n\n\nHolger received a wildcard and won a match at the 2019 Blois ATP Challenger in June.[11][12] At the time, he was 16 years, 1 month and 18 days old. Holger also competed in the 2019 Amersfoort Challenger in July where he captured his second ATP Challenger match win.[13]\n\n\nOn 28 October 2019 he achieved a ITF juniors ranking of World No. 1 after he defeated Harold Mayot to win the ITF Junior Finals.[14]\n\n\nRune served as a practice partner at the 2019 ATP Finals.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2020: First ITF title, Top 500 debut[edit]\n\n\nRune officially turned pro in 2020 at the age of 16.\n\n\nAt the 2020 Auckland Open, Rune received a wildcard into the qualifying draw but lost to Vasek Pospisil in straight sets.\n\n\nIn July 2020, Holger became the youngest player to compete at the Ultimate Tennis Showdown (UTS), where he was defeated by French player Corentin Moutet.[15]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Rune won his first ITF title at an M25 event in Switzerland. He would make three more ITF finals by the end of 2020, winning two of the three.\n\n\nIn October 2020, Rune received a wildcard to the ATP Challenger 80 in Puente Romano in Marbella, AnyTech365 Marbella Tennis Open. He lost 1–2 (6–1, 4–6, 4–6) in the first round to Elliot Benchetrit.[16]\n\n\n\n### 2021: First ATP win, top 110[edit]\n\n\nRune made three more ITF finals at the start of 2021, winning one.\n\n\nIn March 2021, Rune made his ATP debut as a wildcard in the Argentina Open. He lost in the first round to fifth seeded Albert Ramos Viñolas in three sets. At the Chile Open the next week, Rune was accepted into the qualifying draw as a wildcard. He went on to win the qualifying round and record his first ATP match win against Sebastián Báez in straight sets.[17] He followed this up with his first top-30 victory over Benoît Paire in straight sets to reach his first ATP quarterfinal, where he lost to Federico Delbonis in straight sets. At the age of 17, he became the youngest ATP Tour quarterfinalist since 2014.\n\n\nIn June 2021, Rune won his first ATP Challenger title in Biella. His victory was overshadowed by homophobic slurs he made during his semi-final match.[18] His actions were investigated by the ATP, and he was fined for his homophobic outburst.[19]\n\n\nIn July 2021, Rune received another wave of wildcards into several clay-court events during the summer clay-court swing: the Swedish Open, Croatia Open, and Austrian Open Kitzbühel. He posted a few more match wins in these tournaments which boosted his ranking to a career-high of No. 145 on 23 August 2021 after winning the San Marino Open and the Verona Challenger, making him the second youngest male player in the top 150.\n\n\nRune entered the 2021 US Open Qualifying as the 24th seed. There, he won all three of his qualifying matches to qualify for the 2021 US Open for his grand slam debut. He played world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the first round, where he lost the first set and won the second set in a tiebreak, but started to cramp late in the third set and eventually lost the match.\n\n\nRune made his second ATP quarterfinal at the Moselle Open, after qualifying for the main draw. He double-bageled lucky loser Bernabé Zapata Miralles in the first round, and then upset fifth seed Lorenzo Sonego in the second round in three sets to make the quarterfinals. He lost in the quarterfinals to second seed Pablo Carreño Busta in three sets.\n\n\nOn 4 November 2021, Rune qualified for the 2021 Next Generation ATP Finals.[20][21] He finished the year ranked No. 103 in the ATP rankings.\n\n\n\n### 2022: Paris Masters title and breaking into top 10[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rune at the 2022 Monte-Carlo Masters\nRune made his debut in the top 100 of the ATP singles rankings on 17 January 2022 at world No. 99, making him the second youngest male player after Carlos Alcaraz to be ranked in the top 100. [22] At the 2022 Open 13, he reached his first career ATP semifinal in the doubles tournament with partner Hugo Gaston, defeating top seeds Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Polish pair Szymon Walków and Jan Zieliński before losing to eventual champions Andrey Rublev and Denys Molchanov.[23]\n\n\nIn April, Rune received a wild card to the Bavarian International Tennis Championships, where he defeated world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in the second round for his first top 10 win in his career in straight sets to advance to his third ATP quarterfinal.[24] He then overcame Emil Ruusuvuori[25] and Oscar Otte to reach his first career ATP singles final.[26] There, his opponent, Botic van de Zandschulp, was forced to retire with chest pain with the scoreline at 3–4, leading the 70th-ranked Rune to become the tournament's third youngest champion in the Open Era after Guillermo Perez-Roldan in 1987.[27][28][29] The title propelled Rune into the top 50 on 2 May 2022.[30]\n\n\nThe following month, Rune made his main draw debut at the French Open, where he shocked 14th seed Denis Shapovalov in the first round before defeating Henri Laaksonen and Gaston in the second and third rounds, respectively, all in straight sets. He then stunned fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas to earn his third win of the season over a top 15 player to reach his first career Grand Slam quarterfinal, making him the first Danish man in singles to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament in the Open Era.[31] There, he succumbed to Casper Ruud in four sets,[32] but the achievement landed Rune inside the world's top 30.[33]\n\n\nRune did not win a match between the French Open and Washington. In Washington, as the 9th seed, he beat Benoît Paire in the second round before losing to wildcard J.J. Wolf in the third round. In Montreal, Rune beat Fabio Fognini in straight sets in the first round, then lost to eventual champion Pablo Carreño Busta in the second round. In Cincinnati, Rune lost to 9th seed Cameron Norrie in the first round. At the US Open, Rune beat Peter Gojowczyk and received a walkover from John Isner to reach the third round, where he lost again to Norrie.\n\n\nHe reached his second ATP final in Sofia, beating Tim van Rijthoven, Lorenzo Sonego[34] and Ilya Ivashka, then moved on to the final after defending champion and top seed Jannik Sinner retired in the middle of their match due to injury.[35] He lost to Marc-Andrea Hüsler in the final. As a result he qualified for the 2022 Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan on 30 September.[36]\n\n\nHe reached his third final at the 2022 Stockholm Open by defeating fifth seed Alex de Minaur. As a result he reached the top 25 in the rankings on 24 October 2022.[37] He won his second title defeating top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final.[38] The following week at the next tournament in Basel he beat again seventh seeded Alex de Minaur in the first round.[39] He reached the final defeating two Frenchmen Ugo Humbert and Arthur Rinderknech, and then sixth seed Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinals. As a result he made his top 20 debut in the rankings at No. 18 on 31 October 2022.[40] He became only the fourth man born in the 2000s to reach the Top 20 in the ATP rankings.[41]\n\n\nHe saved three match points in his opening match against Wawrinka on his debut at the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters.[42] He then defeated four top-10 players in a row: 10th seed Hubert Hurkacz, world No. 9 and 7th seed Andrey Rublev, World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz,[43] and world No. 8 Félix Auger-Aliassime,[44] to reach his first Masters 1000 and fourth final in a row. It was his 18th tour-level win in 20 matches.[45] He defeated 6th seed and world No. 7 defending champion Novak Djokovic, his fifth top-10 win in a row, to win his first Masters 1000 title, the youngest champion in Paris since Boris Becker in 1986.[46] He became the first man to beat five top-10 opponents in the same event (excluding the ATP Finals). As a result he moved into the top 10 in the rankings on 7 November 2022.[47] He also moved one position up as first alternate for the 2022 ATP Finals and on the same day, on 6 November 2022, he decided to withdraw from the 2022 Next Generation ATP Finals.[48]\n\n\n\n### 2023: Two Masters 1000 finals, tenth top-10 win, World No. 4[edit]\n\n\nFollowing his semifinal showing at the Mexican Open,[49] he moved up two spots in the singles rankings to world No. 8 on 6 March 2023.[50][51]\n\n\nOn 3 April 2023, he announced his split with coach Patrick Mouratoglou after six months together.[52] Holger Rune's mom, Aneke Rune, has described that \"ego clashes\" within the coaching team resulted in the termination of Patrick Mouratoglou's involvement. [53][54]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters he defeated third seed Daniil Medvedev to reach the semifinals marking his first top-5 win of the season and tenth top-10 win overall.[55] Next he defeated another top-10 player Jannik Sinner to reach his second Masters final, before losing to Andrey Rublev in three sets. As a result, he moved to world No. 7 in the rankings on 17 April 2023 making him the highest ranked Dane in history (tied with Kurt Nielsen).[56][57] Next at the 2023 BMW Open, he reached his second consecutive final on clay following wins over Yannick Hanfmann, Cristian Garín, and Christopher O'Connell to set up a rematch of the previous year's final with Botic van de Zandschulp.[58][59] He won in three sets to successfully defend his title and lift his first trophy of the season.[60]\nOn his debut at the Rome Masters he defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic for a second time to reach the semifinals.[61] He defeated fourth seed Casper Ruud for his second top-5 win in a row to reach his second Masters final of the season.[62][63] He moved to a new career high ranking of world No. 6 making him the highest Danish player in history of the ATP rankings.[64] At the 2023 French Open he reached the quarterfinals defeating 23rd seed Francisco Cerúndolo for a second consecutive season but lost to fourth seed and previous year runner-up Casper Ruud.[65]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Queen's Club Championships he won his first match on grass as a senior against American Maxime Cressy.[66] He reached the semi finals without dropping a set, defeating sixth seed Lorenzo Musetti in the quarterfinals.[67] He reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon losing to eventual champion top seed Carlos Alcaraz.\n\n\nFollowing the results of the 2023 National Bank Open, he debuted in the top 5 of the ATP rankings for the first time on 14 August 2023 at No. 5. A week later on August 21 2023, he attained a new career-high ranking of No. 4 following his second round showing at the 2023 Western & Southern Open. This also ensured that he will receive his highest seeding at a Grand Slam at the 2023 US Open (tennis) as the fourth seed.\n\n\nIn October, he hired Boris Becker as his coach for the remainder of the 2023 season.[68][69] Holger Rune commented that Boris Becker’s fraudulent bankruptcy and UK jail sentence should not make a difference in their collaboration and Rune was quoted saying “I didn’t think about that”. Despite the fact that Becker is currently unable to travel to the UK as a result of his criminal conviction.[70] Becker encouraged Rune to attempt to play without hat and without jewellery, items which could distract him during matches. This was a strategy which Becker himself found useful during his own playing career. Rune followed this advice during the October, 2023 Swiss Indoor in Basel, reaching the semi-final.[71] [72]\n\n\n\n## Singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n

He has been ranked as high as world No. 4 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), making him the highest-ranked male Danish player in the history of the ATP rankings.[3]Rune has won four ATP Tour singles titles, including a Masters 1000 title at the 2022 Paris Masters, and produced his best Grand Slam performance at the 2022 French Open by reaching the quarterfinals in his main draw debut at the tournament. As a junior, Rune was ranked as high as world No. 1 and won ten titles on the ITF Junior Circuit, including the 2019 French Open boys' title. After turning professional in 2020, he won five titles on the ITF World Tennis Tour and five on the ATP Challenger Tour and made his top 100 debut in the 2022.Three months later, Rune reached his first ATP Tour final at the 2022 Bavarian International Tennis Championships, where he won his first title and subsequently entered the top 50. By winning the Paris Masters later that year, Rune made his top 10 debut and became the first player on record (since the ATP rankings began in 1973) to beat five top-10 opponents at the same event outside the ATP Finals.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nRune was born on 29 April 2003 in Gentofte, Denmark, to Aneke Rune and Anders Nødskov. He has a sister named Alma. He began playing tennis at the age of 6 because his sister played and he started to take the sport seriously. Throughout his childhood, he was coached by Lars Christensen, and along with his mother, he is credited as his biggest inspiration.[3] His idols growing up were fellow tennis players Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.[6]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, he became Danish U12 champion in mixed doubles with Clara Tauson.[7]\n\n\nHe started training at the Mouratoglou Academy in 2016.[8]\n\n\nIn 2017, he won the European U14 singles championship.[9]\n\n\nAt age 15, he became the youngest Danish male singles champion by winning the 2019 indoor tournament.[10]\n\n\nOn 8 June 2019 Rune defeated Toby Alex Kodat to win the 2019 French Open boys' singles title.\n\n\nHolger received a wildcard and won a match at the 2019 Blois ATP Challenger in June.[11][12] At the time, he was 16 years, 1 month and 18 days old. Holger also competed in the 2019 Amersfoort Challenger in July where he captured his second ATP Challenger match win.[13]\n\n\nOn 28 October 2019 he achieved a ITF juniors ranking of World No. 1 after he defeated Harold Mayot to win the ITF Junior Finals.[14]\n\n\nRune served as a practice partner at the 2019 ATP Finals.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2020: First ITF title, Top 500 debut[edit]\n\n\nRune officially turned pro in 2020 at the age of 16.\n\n\nAt the 2020 Auckland Open, Rune received a wildcard into the qualifying draw but lost to Vasek Pospisil in straight sets.\n\n\nIn July 2020, Holger became the youngest player to compete at the Ultimate Tennis Showdown (UTS), where he was defeated by French player Corentin Moutet.[15]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Rune won his first ITF title at an M25 event in Switzerland. He would make three more ITF finals by the end of 2020, winning two of the three.\n\n\nIn October 2020, Rune received a wildcard to the ATP Challenger 80 in Puente Romano in Marbella, AnyTech365 Marbella Tennis Open. He lost 1–2 (6–1, 4–6, 4–6) in the first round to Elliot Benchetrit.[16]\n\n\n\n### 2021: First ATP win, top 110[edit]\n\n\nRune made three more ITF finals at the start of 2021, winning one.\n\n\nIn March 2021, Rune made his ATP debut as a wildcard in the Argentina Open. He lost in the first round to fifth seeded Albert Ramos Viñolas in three sets. At the Chile Open the next week, Rune was accepted into the qualifying draw as a wildcard. He went on to win the qualifying round and record his first ATP match win against Sebastián Báez in straight sets.[17] He followed this up with his first top-30 victory over Benoît Paire in straight sets to reach his first ATP quarterfinal, where he lost to Federico Delbonis in straight sets. At the age of 17, he became the youngest ATP Tour quarterfinalist since 2014.\n\n\nIn June 2021, Rune won his first ATP Challenger title in Biella. His victory was overshadowed by homophobic slurs he made during his semi-final match.[18] His actions were investigated by the ATP, and he was fined for his homophobic outburst.[19]\n\n\nIn July 2021, Rune received another wave of wildcards into several clay-court events during the summer clay-court swing: the Swedish Open, Croatia Open, and Austrian Open Kitzbühel. He posted a few more match wins in these tournaments which boosted his ranking to a career-high of No. 145 on 23 August 2021 after winning the San Marino Open and the Verona Challenger, making him the second youngest male player in the top 150.\n\n\nRune entered the 2021 US Open Qualifying as the 24th seed. There, he won all three of his qualifying matches to qualify for the 2021 US Open for his grand slam debut. He played world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the first round, where he lost the first set and won the second set in a tiebreak, but started to cramp late in the third set and eventually lost the match.\n\n\nRune made his second ATP quarterfinal at the Moselle Open, after qualifying for the main draw. He double-bageled lucky loser Bernabé Zapata Miralles in the first round, and then upset fifth seed Lorenzo Sonego in the second round in three sets to make the quarterfinals. He lost in the quarterfinals to second seed Pablo Carreño Busta in three sets.\n\n\nOn 4 November 2021, Rune qualified for the 2021 Next Generation ATP Finals.[20][21] He finished the year ranked No. 103 in the ATP rankings.\n\n\n\n### 2022: Paris Masters title and breaking into top 10[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rune at the 2022 Monte-Carlo Masters\nRune made his debut in the top 100 of the ATP singles rankings on 17 January 2022 at world No. 99, making him the second youngest male player after Carlos Alcaraz to be ranked in the top 100. [22] At the 2022 Open 13, he reached his first career ATP semifinal in the doubles tournament with partner Hugo Gaston, defeating top seeds Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Polish pair Szymon Walków and Jan Zieliński before losing to eventual champions Andrey Rublev and Denys Molchanov.[23]\n\n\nIn April, Rune received a wild card to the Bavarian International Tennis Championships, where he defeated world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in the second round for his first top 10 win in his career in straight sets to advance to his third ATP quarterfinal.[24] He then overcame Emil Ruusuvuori[25] and Oscar Otte to reach his first career ATP singles final.[26] There, his opponent, Botic van de Zandschulp, was forced to retire with chest pain with the scoreline at 3–4, leading the 70th-ranked Rune to become the tournament's third youngest champion in the Open Era after Guillermo Perez-Roldan in 1987.[27][28][29] The title propelled Rune into the top 50 on 2 May 2022.[30]\n\n\nThe following month, Rune made his main draw debut at the French Open, where he shocked 14th seed Denis Shapovalov in the first round before defeating Henri Laaksonen and Gaston in the second and third rounds, respectively, all in straight sets. He then stunned fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas to earn his third win of the season over a top 15 player to reach his first career Grand Slam quarterfinal, making him the first Danish man in singles to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament in the Open Era.[31] There, he succumbed to Casper Ruud in four sets,[32] but the achievement landed Rune inside the world's top 30.[33]\n\n\nRune did not win a match between the French Open and Washington. In Washington, as the 9th seed, he beat Benoît Paire in the second round before losing to wildcard J.J. Wolf in the third round. In Montreal, Rune beat Fabio Fognini in straight sets in the first round, then lost to eventual champion Pablo Carreño Busta in the second round. In Cincinnati, Rune lost to 9th seed Cameron Norrie in the first round. At the US Open, Rune beat Peter Gojowczyk and received a walkover from John Isner to reach the third round, where he lost again to Norrie.\n\n\nHe reached his second ATP final in Sofia, beating Tim van Rijthoven, Lorenzo Sonego[34] and Ilya Ivashka, then moved on to the final after defending champion and top seed Jannik Sinner retired in the middle of their match due to injury.[35] He lost to Marc-Andrea Hüsler in the final. As a result he qualified for the 2022 Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan on 30 September.[36]\n\n\nHe reached his third final at the 2022 Stockholm Open by defeating fifth seed Alex de Minaur. As a result he reached the top 25 in the rankings on 24 October 2022.[37] He won his second title defeating top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final.[38] The following week at the next tournament in Basel he beat again seventh seeded Alex de Minaur in the first round.[39] He reached the final defeating two Frenchmen Ugo Humbert and Arthur Rinderknech, and then sixth seed Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinals. As a result he made his top 20 debut in the rankings at No. 18 on 31 October 2022.[40] He became only the fourth man born in the 2000s to reach the Top 20 in the ATP rankings.[41]\n\n\nHe saved three match points in his opening match against Wawrinka on his debut at the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters.[42] He then defeated four top-10 players in a row: 10th seed Hubert Hurkacz, world No. 9 and 7th seed Andrey Rublev, World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz,[43] and world No. 8 Félix Auger-Aliassime,[44] to reach his first Masters 1000 and fourth final in a row. It was his 18th tour-level win in 20 matches.[45] He defeated 6th seed and world No. 7 defending champion Novak Djokovic, his fifth top-10 win in a row, to win his first Masters 1000 title, the youngest champion in Paris since Boris Becker in 1986.[46] He became the first man to beat five top-10 opponents in the same event (excluding the ATP Finals). As a result he moved into the top 10 in the rankings on 7 November 2022.[47] He also moved one position up as first alternate for the 2022 ATP Finals and on the same day, on 6 November 2022, he decided to withdraw from the 2022 Next Generation ATP Finals.[48]\n\n\n\n### 2023: Two Masters 1000 finals, tenth top-10 win, World No. 4[edit]\n\n\nFollowing his semifinal showing at the Mexican Open,[49] he moved up two spots in the singles rankings to world No. 8 on 6 March 2023.[50][51]\n\n\nOn 3 April 2023, he announced his split with coach Patrick Mouratoglou after six months together.[52] Holger Rune's mom, Aneke Rune, has described that \"ego clashes\" within the coaching team resulted in the termination of Patrick Mouratoglou's involvement. [53][54]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters he defeated third seed Daniil Medvedev to reach the semifinals marking his first top-5 win of the season and tenth top-10 win overall.[55] Next he defeated another top-10 player Jannik Sinner to reach his second Masters final, before losing to Andrey Rublev in three sets. As a result, he moved to world No. 7 in the rankings on 17 April 2023 making him the highest ranked Dane in history (tied with Kurt Nielsen).[56][57] Next at the 2023 BMW Open, he reached his second consecutive final on clay following wins over Yannick Hanfmann, Cristian Garín, and Christopher O'Connell to set up a rematch of the previous year's final with Botic van de Zandschulp.[58][59] He won in three sets to successfully defend his title and lift his first trophy of the season.[60]\nOn his debut at the Rome Masters he defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic for a second time to reach the semifinals.[61] He defeated fourth seed Casper Ruud for his second top-5 win in a row to reach his second Masters final of the season.[62][63] He moved to a new career high ranking of world No. 6 making him the highest Danish player in history of the ATP rankings.[64] At the 2023 French Open he reached the quarterfinals defeating 23rd seed Francisco Cerúndolo for a second consecutive season but lost to fourth seed and previous year runner-up Casper Ruud.[65]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Queen's Club Championships he won his first match on grass as a senior against American Maxime Cressy.[66] He reached the semi finals without dropping a set, defeating sixth seed Lorenzo Musetti in the quarterfinals.[67] He reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon losing to eventual champion top seed Carlos Alcaraz.\n\n\nFollowing the results of the 2023 National Bank Open, he debuted in the top 5 of the ATP rankings for the first time on 14 August 2023 at No. 5. A week later on August 21 2023, he attained a new career-high ranking of No. 4 following his second round showing at the 2023 Western & Southern Open. This also ensured that he will receive his highest seeding at a Grand Slam at the 2023 US Open (tennis) as the fourth seed.\n\n\nIn October, he hired Boris Becker as his coach for the remainder of the 2023 season.[68][69] Holger Rune commented that Boris Becker’s fraudulent bankruptcy and UK jail sentence should not make a difference in their collaboration and Rune was quoted saying “I didn’t think about that”. Despite the fact that Becker is currently unable to travel to the UK as a result of his criminal conviction.[70] Becker encouraged Rune to attempt to play without hat and without jewellery, items which could distract him during matches. This was a strategy which Becker himself found useful during his own playing career. Rune followed this advice during the October, 2023 Swiss Indoor in Basel, reaching the semi-final.[71] [72]\n\n\n\n## Singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n

He has a career-high doubles ranking of No. 64, achieved on 29 August 2022.\n\n\nBorn into a tennis family – his mother Julia was a professional on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tour and his father Apostolos trained as a tennis coach – Tsitsipas was introduced to the sport at age three and began taking lessons at age six. As a junior, he was ranked No. 1 in the world, and won the 2016 Wimbledon boys' doubles event.\n\n\n\nWinning his first match on the ATP Tour in late 2017, Tsitsipas quickly ascended the ATP rankings the following year. He won his first title at the 2018 Stockholm Open and made a runner-up finish at the 2018 Canadian Open, becoming the youngest player to defeat four top ten opponents in a single tournament at the latter event. Since culminating that season with an exhibition title at the Next Gen ATP Finals, Tsitsipas has remained a constant fixture in the top 10 of the ATP rankings. He won his first Masters 1000 event at the 2021 Monte-Carlo Masters, and defended his title in 2022. Tsitsipas was named the Greek Male Athlete of the Year for 2019.\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\nTsitsipas was born on 12 August 1998 to Apostolos Tsitsipas and Julia Apostoli (née Salnikova) in Athens. His father is Greek and was born in Proastio, Karditsa[7] and his mother is Russian. His maternal grandfather, Sergei Salnikov, was a Soviet footballer who played for Zenit Leningrad, Spartak Moscow and Dynamo Moscow. Salnikov was also half Greek.[8] Both of his parents are experienced tennis players, and his mother in particular was a world No. 1 junior who had a career-high professional ranking inside the top 200 and represented the Soviet Union in the Federation Cup.[9] His parents had been working as tennis instructors at the Astir Palace resort hotel in Vouliagmeni at the time of his birth.[10] They originally met at a WTA tournament in Athens where his mother was competing and his father was a line judge.[11] Stefanos has three younger siblings: two brothers Petros and Pavlos (Paul), and a sister Elisavet who is the youngest. All of his siblings are also tennis players.[12]\n\n\nWith their strong backgrounds in tennis, Tsitsipas's parents got their oldest son started on tennis at a very young age. Stefanos has said, \"My first memory is to be three and to hit balls with my father in the gap between lessons. I remember watching games on TV, as a baby, I can not tell you who was playing, but I remember watching.\"[11] He also participated in other sports as a kid, including football and swimming. His father said Stefanos made the decision to become a tennis player himself, recalling that his son \"woke up in the middle of the night\" after a tournament in France at age nine and told him \"Dad, I have to tell you something: I want to become a tennis player, I like the competition, I like the challenge.\"[13][14]\n\n\nTsitsipas began taking lessons at Tennis Club Glyfada near Athens at the age of six, and has continued to train there.[11][15] His father has always served as his primary coach, and he formally studied tennis coaching at the University of Athens to help train his children.[9][14][16] In 2015, Tsitsipas also began training at the Patrick Mouratoglou Academy, splitting time between France and Greece during this period.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas at the 2015 US Open\nTsitsipas is a former world No. 1 junior.[20] He began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit in 2013 at the age of 14. He did not play in any high-level Grade A tournaments until the Abierto Juvenil Mexicano in November 2014, but was able to make it all the way to the final of his second career Grade A event at the Orange Bowl a month later.[20][21] Tsitsipas had entered the tournament ranked outside of the top 100 in the junior rankings.[22] In 2015, Tsitsipas got his first opportunity to play in the junior Grand Slam tournaments. In these four events, a quarterfinal at the Australian Open was his best result.[20] He did not win any singles finals that year, but he did have another runner-up finish at the Orange Bowl, this time losing to Miomir Kecmanović in a third set tiebreak.[20][23] He finished the season as the No. 14 ranked junior in the world.[24]\n\n\nIn 2016, Tsitsipas had a breakout year, reaching at least the quarterfinals of all eight tournaments that he played, including all four Grand Slams.[20] He became the top-ranked junior in the world after winning his first Grade A title at the Trofeo Bonfiglio.[25] Tsitsipas also won the European Junior Championships later in the year.[26] Tsitsipas's biggest title of the season came in doubles, when he partnered with Estonian player Kenneth Raisma to win his only junior Grand Slam event at Wimbledon.[27] He became the first male Greek to win a junior Grand Slam in the Open Era, and the second overall after Nicky Kalogeropoulos won both the French Open and Wimbledon in 1963.[11] Besides his doubles triumph, Tsitsipas also had his two best finishes in the Grand Slam singles events that year, making the semifinals of both Wimbledon and the US Open.[28][29] He ended the year as the No. 2 ranked junior in the world, behind only Kecmanović who had played several more events.[30]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–17: Top 100, ATP semifinal, top 10 victory[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas with the runner-up trophy at the 2017 Brest Challenger\nTsitsipas began playing low-level ITF Futures events in Greece in 2013 shortly after turning 15, not long after he started competing on the junior tour.[31] He qualified for his first event on the ATP Challenger Tour at the Burnie International in early 2015 while still 16 years old, but lost his only main draw match to Benjamin Mitchell.[32] Tsitsipas won his first Futures title later that year and would go on to win a total of eleven such titles, five in singles and six in doubles, through the end of 2016.[31] He also won his first Challenger match near the end of 2015 in Mohammedia in Morocco.[32] Tsitsipas returned to Morocco a year later and reached his first two Challenger finals in back-to-back weeks at Mohammedia and Casablanca.[33] This success in Africa helped him crack the top 200 later that October.[34] Towards the end of that month, Tsitsipas was granted a qualifying wild card into the Swiss Indoors in Basel, his first ATP Tour appearance. He defeated Rajeev Ram in the opening round, but was unable to qualify after a loss to Robin Haase.[35]\n\n\nTsitsipas played in his first ATP main draw at the 2017 Rotterdam Open, where he lost his debut match to the eventual champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.[36] He also made his Grand Slam debut later that year as a qualifier at the French Open, but lost to Ivo Karlović in his first match.[37] After losing in qualifying at the US Open, Tsitsipas won his first Challenger title in Genova.[38] Overall, he qualified for a tour-best eight events during the season, including Wimbledon and the Shanghai Masters.[37] However, he did not win a tour-level match until the very end of the season when he defeated fellow Next Gen player Karen Khachanov in Shanghai.[39] At the European Open in Belgium the following week, Tsitsipas reached his first ATP semifinal as a qualifier. During the event, he upset hometown favorite and world No. 10 David Goffin for his first career top 10 victory.[39] With this run, Tsitsipas became the first Greek player to be ranked in the top 100 of the ATP rankings, accomplishing the feat at the age of 19 and surpassed Konstantinos Economidis as the highest ranked Greek player. He also reached a high enough ranking to be named an alternate for the Next Gen ATP Finals.[40][41][42] Tsitsipas closed out the season with another Challenger final, this time in Brest.[43]\n\n\n\n### 2018: Masters final, Next Gen champion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas at the 2018 Washington Open\nTsitsipas started the year at the Qatar Open where he lost in the quarterfinals to world No. 5 Dominic Thiem, again as a qualifier.[44] After losing in the opening round in his Australian Open debut, his best result in the rest of the early-year hard court season was another quarterfinal at the Dubai Tennis Championships.[45][46] Tsitsipas's first breakthrough of the year came at the Barcelona Open during the clay court season, where he reached his first career ATP final without dropping a set. During the ATP 500 Series tournament, he defeated three top 20 players including No. 7 Thiem, before losing to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in a lopsided match. With this result, Tsitsipas moved into the top 50 and became the second Greek to reach an ATP final after Nicky Kalogeropoulos in 1973.[47] His performance also gained national attention in Greece, where tennis is not a widely popular sport.[48][10] The following week at the Estoril Open, he reached another semifinal. He also picked up a third career top ten victory over No. 8 Kevin Anderson.[49]\n\n\nTsitsipas closed out the clay court season by winning his first career Grand Slam match at the French Open against Carlos Taberner before losing to Thiem, the eventual runner-up.[9] He played the next Grand Slam at Wimbledon seeded for first time at No. 31.[50] He took advantage of the seed and produced his best result at a major tournament at the time, a fourth round loss to No. 10 John Isner.[51][52]\n\n\nTsitsipas had his second big breakthrough of the year in the lead up to the US Open. After reaching the semifinals in Washington,[53] he reached his second final of the season and first career Masters final at the Canadian Open. During the tournament, he became the youngest player to record four top ten wins in a single event, defeating No. 8 Dominic Thiem, No. 10 Novak Djokovic, No. 3 Alexander Zverev, and No. 6 Kevin Anderson in succession. He also saved match points in the latter two matches.[54][55] Tsitsipas lost the final to Nadal on his 20th birthday in a closer match than their first encounter. He also climbed to No. 15 in the world.[55][56]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Tsitsipas made his main draw debut, but was upset in the second round by fellow Next Gen player Daniil Medvedev.[57] He cited fatigue as a factor in the loss and proceeded to exit before the quarterfinals at three of his next four tournaments as well.[58][59] However, Tsitsipas was able to recover at the Stockholm Open. Playing as the third seed, he defeated second seed and No. 14 Fabio Fognini in the semifinals before winning in the final against veteran qualifier Ernests Gulbis. With the victory, he became the first Greek player to win an ATP title.[60] Tsitsipas closed out his season at the Next Gen ATP Finals. He was the top seed at the event and was drawn with Frances Tiafoe, Hubert Hurkacz, and Jaume Munar. Tsitsipas swept his group and defeated Andrey Rublev to advance to the final against second seed Alex de Minaur.[61][62] He defeated de Minaur in four sets to win the Next Gen Finals.[63] At the end of the year, Tsitsipas was named the ATP Most Improved Player for his breakthrough season.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2019: ATP Finals champion, world No. 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas at the 2019 Sydney International\nTsitsipas began the season at the Hopman Cup alongside Maria Sakkari, making them the first team to represent Greece at the event in 17 years.[65] They finished in a three-way tie for first in their round-robin group, having won their ties against the United States and Switzerland after being upset in their opening tie against Great Britain.[66] They were ranked second on the tiebreak criteria and did not advance out of the group. Tsitsipas's only singles win was against Frances Tiafoe, while one of his losses was against Roger Federer.[67][68] At the 2019 Australian Open, Tsitsipas reached his first major semifinal, despite having won just five Grand Slam singles matches in total the previous year. All five of his wins at the event came in four sets.[31] He upset world No. 3 and defending champion Roger Federer in the fourth round, saving all twelve of the break points he faced in a rematch of their Hopman Cup encounter earlier in the month.[69] After continuing his run against Roberto Bautista Agut, he easily lost to No. 2 Rafael Nadal, winning only six games.[70][71] Nonetheless, his performance helped him climb to a career-best ranking of No. 12 in the world to become the highest-ranked Greek player in history.[72]\n\n\nTsitsipas built on his Grand Slam success by reaching two finals in February in back-to-back weeks. He won his second career title at the Open 13 in Marseille over Mikhail Kukushkin[73] before finishing runner-up to Federer at the Dubai Tennis Championships. His performance in Dubai put him in the top 10 of the ATP rankings for the first time.[74] Tsitsipas closed out the early year hard court season with a career-best result in doubles, finishing runner-up to the Bryan brothers at the Miami Open with Wesley Koolhof.[75] Tsitsipas also had an excellent clay court season. He won his first career clay court title a month later at the Estoril Open after defeating Pablo Cuevas in the final.[76] The following week, he made another Masters final at the Madrid Open. During the event, he defeated No. 4 Alexander Zverev and No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively before finishing runner-up to No. 1 Novak Djokovic.[77][78] This was his first win over Nadal in four attempts.[79] Nadal defeated Tsitsipas a week later at the Italian Open.[80] Nonetheless, Tsitsipas rose to No. 6 in the world after this series of tournaments.[34] At the French Open, Tsitsipas was upset in the fourth round by Stan Wawrinka, in a marathon five set match that ended 6–8 in the final set.[81][82][83]\n\n\nDespite a strong first half of the season, Tsitsipas began to struggle following the French Open. He lost his opening round matches at Wimbledon and the US Open to Thomas Fabbiano and Andrey Rublev respectively, and both Masters tournaments in August.[84][85] Despite this, he reached a career-best ranking of No. 5 in early August.[34] Tsitsipas ultimately rebounded beginning in October. He defeated Zverev again at the China Open en route to finishing runner-up to No. 5 Dominic Thiem.[86] He then made two semifinals at the Shanghai Masters and the Swiss Indoors, losing to other top five players again in No. 4 Daniil Medvedev and No. 3 Roger Federer.[87][88] At the end of the season, Tsitsipas qualified for the ATP Finals for the first time, where he was placed in a round-robin group with Nadal, Zverev, and Medvedev. He defeated both Medvedev \nand Zverev to advance to the knockout stages after two matches.[89][90] He lost his last group match to Nadal. In the semifinals, Tsitsipas defeated Federer to set up a final against Thiem.[91] Tsitsipas won the championship in a tight match that ended in a third set tiebreak to become the youngest winner of the year-end championship since Lleyton Hewitt in 2001.[92] He finished the season at No. 6 in the world.[34]\n\n\n\n### 2020: French Open semifinal[edit]\n\n\nHe entered the 2020 Australian Open seeded 6th in the men's bracket, but failed to repeat his success of 2019, losing in the 3rd round to Milos Raonic. He then entered the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament seeded 2nd, but failed to live up to his seed as he lost in the round of 16 to Aljaž Bedene. He recovered quickly to defend his title at the Open 13 tournament, winning his 5th ATP title, recording in the process 4 wins in a row without dropping a set, and defeating Félix Auger-Aliassime in the final. The following week he entered the Dubai Tennis Championships as the second seed behind Novak Djokovic. He recorded 4 wins in a row, reaching the final for the second successive year, where he lost in straight sets to the World No. 1.\n\n\nAt the US Open, he was seeded 4th in the men's bracket. He beat Albert Ramos Viñolas and Maxime Cressy without dropping a set before losing to Borna Ćorić in the third round despite having six match points and being a break up in the 5th set.\n\n\nAt the French Open, he was seeded 5th and reached the semifinal, defeating Grigor Dimitrov and Andrey Rublev, before losing to Djokovic in five sets.\n\n\nTsitsipas was unable to defend his 2019 ATP Finals title. He was eliminated from the season ending event with a 1–2 record during the round-robin portion of the competition, having defeated Andrey Rublev, but losing to Dominic Thiem and Rafael Nadal.[93]\n\n\n\n### 2021: French Open final, Masters 1000 champion, world No. 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas at the 2021 French Open\nTsitsipas started his 2021 Australian Open campaign with a comfortable straight sets win over Gilles Simon, before surviving a five set thriller with Thanasi Kokkinakis. He then beat Mikael Ymer in straight sets before being given a walkover by an injured Matteo Berrettini. In the quarterfinals, Tsitsipas became only the second player along with Fabio Fognini at the 2015 US Open to beat Rafael Nadal in a grand slam match from two sets to love down.[94] He eventually lost in the semifinals to Daniil Medvedev. In Rotterdam, Tsitsipas lost in the semifinals to the eventual champion Andrey Rublev.\n\n\nIn April, Tsitsipas won his first Masters 1000 title at the Monte-Carlo Masters, after defeating Aslan Karatsev, Cristian Garín, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Dan Evans and Andrey Rublev.[95] In doing so, Tsitsipas became the first Greek player in history to win a Masters title. In May, Tsitsipas defeated Cameron Norrie in straight sets to win the 2021 Lyon Open and his seventh career title.[96]\n\n\nAt the French Open, Tsitsipas beat Pablo Carreño Busta and Daniil Medvedev to reach his second consecutive French Open semifinal and third consecutive Grand Slam semifinal. He beat Alexander Zverev in five sets to become the first Greek player in history to reach a major final.[97] Tsitsipas achieved a career-high ranking of World No. 4 by advancing to the championship match.[98] There, he lost to world No.1 Novak Djokovic in five sets despite holding a two sets to love lead.[99]\n\n\nTsitsipas suffered an early exit at Wimbledon, losing to Frances Tiafoe in the first round. He took his revenge for the Wimbledon loss by defeating Tiafoe in the second round at the 2020 Olympics.[100][101] He became the first Greek man to win a singles match at the Olympic Games with his first round win over Philipp Kohlschreiber since Augustos Zerlandis in 1924.[102] He lost in the third round to Ugo Humbert of France in three sets.[103] At the US Open, Tsitsipas defeated Andy Murray in 5 sets and Adrian Mannarino in 4 sets to reach the third round. In the third round, he was defeated in 5 sets with a final set tiebreak by World No. 55 and 18 year-old Carlos Alcaraz.[104][105] At the 2021 BNP Paribas Open he reached the quarterfinals, beating Pedro Martínez, Fabio Fognini and Alex de Minaur before losing to Nikoloz Basilashvili.[106] At the ATP Finals, Tsitsipas lost in straight sets to Andrey Rublev before withdrawing from the tournament due to an elbow injury.\n\n\n\n#### Bathroom Break Controversy[edit]\n\n\nAt the US Open, he faced a backlash for taking extended bathroom breaks. In the Cincinnati Masters before the US Open, during a match against Alexander Zverev, Tsitsipas landed in a controversy for taking an extended toilet break after Zverev complained to the umpire about the situation. In the US Open, the controversy became worse, after Tsitsipas took a toilet break twice, when he was losing his first round match against Andy Murray, and even asked to stop the match while down in one of the games. Murray complained after the second toilet break, claiming that Tsitsipas's breaks are too long and change the momentum of the game. He claimed to have \"lost all respect\" for Tsitsipas, and later, after losing the match, wrote on Twitter, claiming that it takes Tsitsipas twice as long to go to the toilet as it takes Jeff Bezos to fly into space.[107][108]\n\n\n\n### 2022: 200th match win, first title on grass[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Australian Open, Tsitsipas reached the semifinals for the third time, where he faced Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of the previous year's semifinal. He lost in four sets, and received a coaching violation when his father Apostolos was caught coaching in Greek.[109]\n\n\nTsitsipas became the first man born in 1998 or later to get 200 career tour-level wins after defeating Laslo Đere in the first round at the 2022 Abierto Mexicano Telcel tournament.[110]\n\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas successfully defended his Monte-Carlo Masters title against Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in two sets to capture his second ATP Masters 1000 title.[111]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Italian Open he reached the quarterfinals, defeating Grigor Dimitrov in the second round, saving two match points in the process[112][113] and Karen Khachanov in the round of 16.[114] In the quarterfinals he defeated Jannik Sinner to reach his third straight semifinal at a Masters level, earning a tour-leading 30 wins for the season.[115] Next he defeated Alexander Zverev, his second consecutive win on clay, for a place in the final. Tsitsipas and Zverev were the only players to reach the semifinals at all three Masters 1000 tournaments on clay in the season.[116] In the finals, he lost to Novak Djokovic.[117]\n\n\nAfter some early losses in the Stuttgart Open and the Halle Open, Tsitsipas won his first title on grass courts after receiving a last minute wildcard at the Mallorca Open, defeating Roberto Bautista Agut in three tight sets.[118]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Wimbledon Championship, Tsitsipas lost in the third round to Nick Kyrgios in four sets.[119] In a fiery match, Tsitsipas was fined $10,000 for two code violations.[120]\n\n\nHe reached his third Masters 1000 final of the season but lost to the in-form and lowest ranked (No. 152) champion in Masters history Croatian Borna Ćorić.\nAt the 2022 US Open, Tsitsipas was seeded fourth. He was defeated by qualifier Daniel Elahi Galán in four sets in the first round, although Tsitsipas saved eight match points.[121]\n\n\nIn October, Tsitsipas reached the final of Astana Open, Kazakhstan, which he lost in straight sets to Novak Djokovic.[122] Next he reached his seventh final at the Stockholm Open but he was defeated by Holger Rune in straight sets.[123] He lost in the second round in Vienna again to Borna Ćorić. He recorded his 60th win for 2022 defeating Tommy Paul in the quarterfinals of the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters to reach his fifth Masters semifinal for the season.[124] In the semifinals, he lost to Novak Djokovic in three sets.[125]\n\n\nAt the 2022 ATP Finals he lost again to Djokovic, his ninth consecutive loss against the five-time season finale champion,[126] and Andrey Rublev, thus not being able to get past the round robin stage.[127]\n\n\nTsitsipas ended the year with a tournament win, the 2022 Mubadala World Tennis Championship.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Australian Open finalist, 300th career win[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas at the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters\nHe recorded his 250th win at the 2023 United Cup defeating Grigor Dimitrov.[128] At the 2023 Australian Open, Tsitsipas defeated Quentin Halys, Rinky Hijikata, Tallon Griekspoor, Jannik Sinner, Jiří Lehečka, and Karen Khachanov on his way to the final. The final was his second Grand Slam final following the 2021 French Open. In both finals, Tsitsipas lost to Novak Djokovic, who tied Rafael Nadal's record of 22 Grand Slam titles. If Tsitsipas had won, he would have clinched the world No.1 ranking for the first time.[129]\n\n\nTsitsipas returned to the Sunshine Double in the United States. At the Indian Wells Masters, he experienced an early first round loss to Jordan Thompson in three close sets. In Miami, he lost to Karen Khachanov in the fourth round in straight sets.\n\n\nHe started his clay-court campaign at the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters, where he was the two-time defending champion. He recorded 12 consecutive wins in the principality after defeating Benjamin Bonzi and Nicolás Jarry, but was ultimately defeated by American Taylor Fritz in straight sets in the quarterfinals. As a result, he dropped two spots to world No. 5. At the second clay court tournament of the year, the 2023 Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, he defeated Pedro Cachin, Denis Shapovalov, Alex de Minaur, and Lorenzo Musetti to reach the second final of the season and third Barcelona final overall. He lost to the top seed Carlos Alcaraz in the championship match in straight sets.\n\n\nFor the beginning of the grass season, he received wildcards for the 2023 BOSS Open[130] and the 2023 Halle Open[131] where he won one match, and at the 2023 Mallorca Championships where he was the defending champion.[132]\n\n\nIn August he won his tenth title at the 2023 Los Cabos Open, defeating John Isner, Nicolás Jarry, Borna Ćorić, and Alex de Minaur in straight sets in the final. Despite this result he dropped to world No. 7 on 21 August 2023 a week before the last Major of the season. At the 2023 US Open (tennis), he lost to No. 128 Swiss player Dominic Stricker in five sets in the second round. \nOn 2 November, in Paris, he recorded his 50th career win over Alexander Zverev for the season, only one of two players, male or female, to record 50 or more wins in each of the last three years, tied with Andrey Rublev. It was also his first top-10 win of the season.[133] With this win he qualified for his fifth consecutive ATP Finals. Next he defeated 16th seed Karen Khachanov to record the 300th win of his career with a straight sets victory in the quarterfinals. He became the first man born in 1998 and the seventh born in the 1990s or later to reach 300 career wins.[134][135]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas serving\nTsitsipas is an aggressive baseliner capable of an all-court player style as well, very similar to Roger Federer. He aims to hit powerful groundstroke winners and has a particularly strong forehand using an Eastern grip.[136] His forehand is particularly useful in finishing points off of the first serve, as combined with his big serve, he uses his high topspin rate to pull opponents off the court for winners, or go to the net more often than typical baseline players.[137] One of his weaknesses is to overhit and make unforced errors while trying to hit winners.[138][139] He also struggles returning serve against players with strong kick serves on the backhand side, a weakness he has worked to improve through usage of blocked and slice returns on his backhand.[140]\n\n\nHis favourite shot is his one-handed backhand, a rarity in modern tennis. His forehand is still his stronger swing, however. He experimented with both one-handed and two-handed backhands in his youth, but chose to go with the former at around eight years old because both of his parents as well as his idol Roger Federer all use a one-handed backhand, and also because it felt more natural. His favourite shot is the backhand down-the-line.[141][142]\n\n\nTsitsipas is regarded as having an all-court game.[143][25][137] His favourite surface is grass and Wimbledon is his favourite tournament.[144] Tsitsipas also excels on clay, having grown up playing on that surface in Greece. He has said, \"I feel very confident when I step on the dirt. I always show my best tennis on this surface.\"[19] Tsitsipas has also done well on hard courts, reaching two Masters finals (Canada, Cincinnati) and three Australian Open semifinals.[55][71]\n\n\nFormer British No. 1 players Greg Rusedski and Annabel Croft have both praised Tsitsipas's on-court demeanor in conjunction with his style of play. Rusedski in particular has said that \"[Tsitsipas] reminds me a little bit of Björn Borg. He does all the right things, he is spectacular as a tennis player and was just sensational with the way he was so calm and composed and he didn't blink when it came to the crunch. He has the competitive nature of Andy Murray, but he also has a calmness which reminds me of Roger Federer.\"[145]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tennis rivalries\n\n### Daniil Medvedev[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Tsitsipas rivalry\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Medvedev leading the rivalry, 9–4. They are considered to be two of the best tennis players of their generation.[*verification needed*] Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their next eight.[146]\n\n\n\n### Alexander Zverev[edit]\n\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Tsitsipas leading the rivalry 9–4. They are considered two of the best of their generation.[147] They have competed in five three-set matches, with Tsitsipas winning four of them, but Zverev won their most memorable three-set match, that being an epic at the 2021 Cincinnati Masters semifinal, in which Zverev prevailed 6–4, 3–6, 7–6(7–4).[148][149] Tsitsipas won their only Grand Slam match so far, in the 2021 French Open semifinals, winning in a five-set match with a scoreline of 6–3, 6–3, 4–6, 4–6, 6–3.[150][151]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas training with his father at the 2019 Laver Cup\nTsitsipas studied at an English-language school in his youth. He can speak English, Greek, and Russian.[16] He is a supporter of Greek football club AEK Athens.[152] Tsitsipas's hobbies include vlogging. He hosts his own YouTube channel where he posts videos of his travels.[153] He has been in a relationship with fellow tennis player Paula Badosa since May 2023.[154]\n\n\nTsitsipas credits his mother's twin sister, who was also a professional tennis player in the Soviet Union, with helping the family's finances so that he could afford to travel with his father to train and compete during his junior career.[10][155] His maternal grandfather Sergei Salnikov was an Olympic gold medal-winning member of the Soviet national football team and a former manager of FC Spartak Moscow.[9][11]\n\n\nDuring a Futures tournament in Crete, Tsitsipas nearly drowned while swimming at sea on an off-day. After a current carried him away from the shore, his father noticed what had happened and helped save his life. He attributes his confident approach of \"[feeling] absolutely zero fear on the court\" to the perspective he gained from this experience.[19]\n\n\nHe is a Greek Orthodox Christian.[156]\n\n\nTsitsipas has expressed interest in promoting the sport of tennis in Greece, where he has said \"tennis is not very popular.\"[10] After his finals appearance at the 2018 Barcelona Open, he commented that his success was helping him achieve this goal. Of his performance and the attention it received, he stated, \"Many people were talking about [the final] and I had plenty of interviews that I did on big channels in Greece for big media centres. It got people's attention... It makes me motivated to do even better in the future, and become even more popular... I hope to inspire more people to play tennis in Greece.\"[48]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stefanos Tsitsipas career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | Q2 | 1R | SF | 3R[A] | SF[A] | SF | F |  | 0 / 6\n | 21–6\n | 78%\n |\n| French Open | 1R | 2R | 4R | SF | F | 4R | QF |  | 0 / 7\n | 22–7\n | 76%\n |\n| Wimbledon | 1R | 4R | 1R | NH\n | 1R | 3R | 4R |  | 0 / 6\n | 8–6\n | 57%\n |\n| US Open | Q3 | 2R | 1R | 3R | 3R | 1R | 2R |  | 0 / 6\n | 6–6\n | 50%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–2\n | 5–4\n | 8–4\n | 8–3\n | 12–4\n | 10–4\n | 14–4\n |  | 0 / 25\n | 57–25\n | 70%\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tsitsipas received walkovers in the second round of the 2020 Australian Open and the fourth round of the 2021 Australian Open, which do not officially count as wins.\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 runners-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | French Open | Clay\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 7–6(8–6), 6–2, 3–6, 2–6, 4–6\n |\n| Loss\n | 2023 | Australian Open | Hard\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic\n | 3–6, 6–7(4–7), 6–7(5–7) |\n\n\n### Year-end championship finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 title)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win\n | 2019 | ATP Finals, London\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 6–7(6–8), 6–2, 7–6(7–4) |\n\n\n### ATP Masters 1000 finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 6 (2 titles, 4 runners-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2018 | Canadian Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 2–6, 6–7(4–7) |\n| Loss | 2019 | Madrid Open | Clay | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 4–6\n |\n| Win | 2021 | Monte-Carlo Masters | Clay | ![Russia](image) Andrey Rublev | 6–3, 6–3\n |\n| Win | 2022 | Monte-Carlo Masters (2) | Clay | ![Spain](image) Alejandro Davidovich Fokina | 6–3, 7–6(7–3) |\n| Loss | 2022 | Italian Open | Clay | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 0–6, 6–7(5–7) |\n| Loss | 2022 | Cincinnati Masters | Hard | ![Croatia](image) Borna Ćorić | 6–7(0–7), 2–6\n |\n\n\n#### Doubles: 1 (1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Partner\n | Opponents\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2019 | Miami Open | Hard\n | ![Netherlands](image) Wesley Koolhof | ![United States](image) Bob Bryan![United States](image) Mike Bryan | 5–7, 6–7(8–10) |\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n#### Open Era records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | Winner of Next Gen ATP Finals and ATP Finals in consecutive years | **Stands alone** |\n| 2019 | Won the ATP Finals title on debut | Àlex CorretjaGrigor DimitrovJohn McEnroeIlie NăstaseStan SmithGuillermo Vilas[157] |\n| 2022 | Defended his first ATP Masters 1000 title | Boris BeckerLleyton HewittRafael Nadal |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Stefanos Tsitsipas | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 3 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which he first achieved on 9 August 2021, making him the highest-ranked Greek player in history alongside Maria Sakkari. \n\n\nTsitsipas was the champion at the 2019 ATP Finals, becoming the youngest winner of the year-end championships in eighteen years. He has won ten ATP singles titles (including two Masters 1000 championships) and has contested two major finals at the 2021 French Open and 2023 Australian Open, finishing runner-up to Novak Djokovic both times. He has a career-high doubles ranking of No. 64, achieved on 29 August 2022.\n\n\nBorn into a tennis family – his mother Julia was a professional on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tour and his father Apostolos trained as a tennis coach – Tsitsipas was introduced to the sport at age three and began taking lessons at age six. As a junior, he was ranked No. 1 in the world, and won the 2016 Wimbledon boys' doubles event.\n\n\n\nWinning his first match on the ATP Tour in late 2017, Tsitsipas quickly ascended the ATP rankings the following year. He won his first title at the 2018 Stockholm Open and made a runner-up finish at the 2018 Canadian Open, becoming the youngest player to defeat four top ten opponents in a single tournament at the latter event. Since culminating that season with an exhibition title at the Next Gen ATP Finals, Tsitsipas has remained a constant fixture in the top 10 of the ATP rankings. He won his first Masters 1000 event at the 2021 Monte-Carlo Masters, and defended his title in 2022. Tsitsipas was named the Greek Male Athlete of the Year for 2019.\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\nTsitsipas was born on 12 August 1998 to Apostolos Tsitsipas and Julia Apostoli (née Salnikova) in Athens. His father is Greek and was born in Proastio, Karditsa[7] and his mother is Russian. His maternal grandfather, Sergei Salnikov, was a Soviet footballer who played for Zenit Leningrad, Spartak Moscow and Dynamo Moscow. Salnikov was also half Greek.[8] Both of his parents are experienced tennis players, and his mother in particular was a world No. 1 junior who had a career-high professional ranking inside the top 200 and represented the Soviet Union in the Federation Cup.[9] His parents had been working as tennis instructors at the Astir Palace resort hotel in Vouliagmeni at the time of his birth.[10] They originally met at a WTA tournament in Athens where his mother was competing and his father was a line judge.[11] Stefanos has three younger siblings: two brothers Petros and Pavlos (Paul), and a sister Elisavet who is the youngest. All of his siblings are also tennis players.[12]\n\n\nWith their strong backgrounds in tennis, Tsitsipas's parents got their oldest son started on tennis at a very young age. Stefanos has said, \"My first memory is to be three and to hit balls with my father in the gap between lessons. I remember watching games on TV, as a baby, I can not tell you who was playing, but I remember watching.\"[11] He also participated in other sports as a kid, including football and swimming. His father said Stefanos made the decision to become a tennis player himself, recalling that his son \"woke up in the middle of the night\" after a tournament in France at age nine and told him \"Dad, I have to tell you something: I want to become a tennis player, I like the competition, I like the challenge.\"[13][14]\n\n\nTsitsipas began taking lessons at Tennis Club Glyfada near Athens at the age of six, and has continued to train there.[11][15] His father has always served as his primary coach, and he formally studied tennis coaching at the University of Athens to help train his children.[9][14][16] In 2015, Tsitsipas also began training at the Patrick Mouratoglou Academy, splitting time between France and Greece during this period.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas at the 2015 US Open\nTsitsipas is a former world No. 1 junior.[20] He began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit in 2013 at the age of 14. He did not play in any high-level Grade A tournaments until the Abierto Juvenil Mexicano in November 2014, but was able to make it all the way to the final of his second career Grade A event at the Orange Bowl a month later.[20][21] Tsitsipas had entered the tournament ranked outside of the top 100 in the junior rankings.[22] In 2015, Tsitsipas got his first opportunity to play in the junior Grand Slam tournaments. In these four events, a quarterfinal at the Australian Open was his best result.[20] He did not win any singles finals that year, but he did have another runner-up finish at the Orange Bowl, this time losing to Miomir Kecmanović in a third set tiebreak.[20][23] He finished the season as the No. 14 ranked junior in the world.[24]\n\n\nIn 2016, Tsitsipas had a breakout year, reaching at least the quarterfinals of all eight tournaments that he played, including all four Grand Slams.[20] He became the top-ranked junior in the world after winning his first Grade A title at the Trofeo Bonfiglio.[25] Tsitsipas also won the European Junior Championships later in the year.[26] Tsitsipas's biggest title of the season came in doubles, when he partnered with Estonian player Kenneth Raisma to win his only junior Grand Slam event at Wimbledon.[27] He became the first male Greek to win a junior Grand Slam in the Open Era, and the second overall after Nicky Kalogeropoulos won both the French Open and Wimbledon in 1963.[11] Besides his doubles triumph, Tsitsipas also had his two best finishes in the Grand Slam singles events that year, making the semifinals of both Wimbledon and the US Open.[28][29] He ended the year as the No. 2 ranked junior in the world, behind only Kecmanović who had played several more events.[30]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–17: Top 100, ATP semifinal, top 10 victory[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas with the runner-up trophy at the 2017 Brest Challenger\nTsitsipas began playing low-level ITF Futures events in Greece in 2013 shortly after turning 15, not long after he started competing on the junior tour.[31] He qualified for his first event on the ATP Challenger Tour at the Burnie International in early 2015 while still 16 years old, but lost his only main draw match to Benjamin Mitchell.[32] Tsitsipas won his first Futures title later that year and would go on to win a total of eleven such titles, five in singles and six in doubles, through the end of 2016.[31] He also won his first Challenger match near the end of 2015 in Mohammedia in Morocco.[32] Tsitsipas returned to Morocco a year later and reached his first two Challenger finals in back-to-back weeks at Mohammedia and Casablanca.[33] This success in Africa helped him crack the top 200 later that October.[34] Towards the end of that month, Tsitsipas was granted a qualifying wild card into the Swiss Indoors in Basel, his first ATP Tour appearance. He defeated Rajeev Ram in the opening round, but was unable to qualify after a loss to Robin Haase.[35]\n\n\nTsitsipas played in his first ATP main draw at the 2017 Rotterdam Open, where he lost his debut match to the eventual champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.[36] He also made his Grand Slam debut later that year as a qualifier at the French Open, but lost to Ivo Karlović in his first match.[37] After losing in qualifying at the US Open, Tsitsipas won his first Challenger title in Genova.[38] Overall, he qualified for a tour-best eight events during the season, including Wimbledon and the Shanghai Masters.[37] However, he did not win a tour-level match until the very end of the season when he defeated fellow Next Gen player Karen Khachanov in Shanghai.[39] At the European Open in Belgium the following week, Tsitsipas reached his first ATP semifinal as a qualifier. During the event, he upset hometown favorite and world No. 10 David Goffin for his first career top 10 victory.[39] With this run, Tsitsipas became the first Greek player to be ranked in the top 100 of the ATP rankings, accomplishing the feat at the age of 19 and surpassed Konstantinos Economidis as the highest ranked Greek player. He also reached a high enough ranking to be named an alternate for the Next Gen ATP Finals.[40][41][42] Tsitsipas closed out the season with another Challenger final, this time in Brest.[43]\n\n\n\n### 2018: Masters final, Next Gen champion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas at the 2018 Washington Open\nTsitsipas started the year at the Qatar Open where he lost in the quarterfinals to world No. 5 Dominic Thiem, again as a qualifier.[44] After losing in the opening round in his Australian Open debut, his best result in the rest of the early-year hard court season was another quarterfinal at the Dubai Tennis Championships.[45][46] Tsitsipas's first breakthrough of the year came at the Barcelona Open during the clay court season, where he reached his first career ATP final without dropping a set. During the ATP 500 Series tournament, he defeated three top 20 players including No. 7 Thiem, before losing to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in a lopsided match. With this result, Tsitsipas moved into the top 50 and became the second Greek to reach an ATP final after Nicky Kalogeropoulos in 1973.[47] His performance also gained national attention in Greece, where tennis is not a widely popular sport.[48][10] The following week at the Estoril Open, he reached another semifinal. He also picked up a third career top ten victory over No. 8 Kevin Anderson.[49]\n\n\nTsitsipas closed out the clay court season by winning his first career Grand Slam match at the French Open against Carlos Taberner before losing to Thiem, the eventual runner-up.[9] He played the next Grand Slam at Wimbledon seeded for first time at No. 31.[50] He took advantage of the seed and produced his best result at a major tournament at the time, a fourth round loss to No. 10 John Isner.[51][52]\n\n\nTsitsipas had his second big breakthrough of the year in the lead up to the US Open. After reaching the semifinals in Washington,[53] he reached his second final of the season and first career Masters final at the Canadian Open. During the tournament, he became the youngest player to record four top ten wins in a single event, defeating No. 8 Dominic Thiem, No. 10 Novak Djokovic, No. 3 Alexander Zverev, and No. 6 Kevin Anderson in succession. He also saved match points in the latter two matches.[54][55] Tsitsipas lost the final to Nadal on his 20th birthday in a closer match than their first encounter. He also climbed to No. 15 in the world.[55][56]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Tsitsipas made his main draw debut, but was upset in the second round by fellow Next Gen player Daniil Medvedev.[57] He cited fatigue as a factor in the loss and proceeded to exit before the quarterfinals at three of his next four tournaments as well.[58][59] However, Tsitsipas was able to recover at the Stockholm Open. Playing as the third seed, he defeated second seed and No. 14 Fabio Fognini in the semifinals before winning in the final against veteran qualifier Ernests Gulbis. With the victory, he became the first Greek player to win an ATP title.[60] Tsitsipas closed out his season at the Next Gen ATP Finals. He was the top seed at the event and was drawn with Frances Tiafoe, Hubert Hurkacz, and Jaume Munar. Tsitsipas swept his group and defeated Andrey Rublev to advance to the final against second seed Alex de Minaur.[61][62] He defeated de Minaur in four sets to win the Next Gen Finals.[63] At the end of the year, Tsitsipas was named the ATP Most Improved Player for his breakthrough season.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2019: ATP Finals champion, world No. 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas at the 2019 Sydney International\nTsitsipas began the season at the Hopman Cup alongside Maria Sakkari, making them the first team to represent Greece at the event in 17 years.[65] They finished in a three-way tie for first in their round-robin group, having won their ties against the United States and Switzerland after being upset in their opening tie against Great Britain.[66] They were ranked second on the tiebreak criteria and did not advance out of the group. Tsitsipas's only singles win was against Frances Tiafoe, while one of his losses was against Roger Federer.[67][68] At the 2019 Australian Open, Tsitsipas reached his first major semifinal, despite having won just five Grand Slam singles matches in total the previous year. All five of his wins at the event came in four sets.[31] He upset world No. 3 and defending champion Roger Federer in the fourth round, saving all twelve of the break points he faced in a rematch of their Hopman Cup encounter earlier in the month.[69] After continuing his run against Roberto Bautista Agut, he easily lost to No. 2 Rafael Nadal, winning only six games.[70][71] Nonetheless, his performance helped him climb to a career-best ranking of No. 12 in the world to become the highest-ranked Greek player in history.[72]\n\n\nTsitsipas built on his Grand Slam success by reaching two finals in February in back-to-back weeks. He won his second career title at the Open 13 in Marseille over Mikhail Kukushkin[73] before finishing runner-up to Federer at the Dubai Tennis Championships. His performance in Dubai put him in the top 10 of the ATP rankings for the first time.[74] Tsitsipas closed out the early year hard court season with a career-best result in doubles, finishing runner-up to the Bryan brothers at the Miami Open with Wesley Koolhof.[75] Tsitsipas also had an excellent clay court season. He won his first career clay court title a month later at the Estoril Open after defeating Pablo Cuevas in the final.[76] The following week, he made another Masters final at the Madrid Open. During the event, he defeated No. 4 Alexander Zverev and No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively before finishing runner-up to No. 1 Novak Djokovic.[77][78] This was his first win over Nadal in four attempts.[79] Nadal defeated Tsitsipas a week later at the Italian Open.[80] Nonetheless, Tsitsipas rose to No. 6 in the world after this series of tournaments.[34] At the French Open, Tsitsipas was upset in the fourth round by Stan Wawrinka, in a marathon five set match that ended 6–8 in the final set.[81][82][83]\n\n\nDespite a strong first half of the season, Tsitsipas began to struggle following the French Open. He lost his opening round matches at Wimbledon and the US Open to Thomas Fabbiano and Andrey Rublev respectively, and both Masters tournaments in August.[84][85] Despite this, he reached a career-best ranking of No. 5 in early August.[34] Tsitsipas ultimately rebounded beginning in October. He defeated Zverev again at the China Open en route to finishing runner-up to No. 5 Dominic Thiem.[86] He then made two semifinals at the Shanghai Masters and the Swiss Indoors, losing to other top five players again in No. 4 Daniil Medvedev and No. 3 Roger Federer.[87][88] At the end of the season, Tsitsipas qualified for the ATP Finals for the first time, where he was placed in a round-robin group with Nadal, Zverev, and Medvedev. He defeated both Medvedev \nand Zverev to advance to the knockout stages after two matches.[89][90] He lost his last group match to Nadal. In the semifinals, Tsitsipas defeated Federer to set up a final against Thiem.[91] Tsitsipas won the championship in a tight match that ended in a third set tiebreak to become the youngest winner of the year-end championship since Lleyton Hewitt in 2001.[92] He finished the season at No. 6 in the world.[34]\n\n\n\n### 2020: French Open semifinal[edit]\n\n\nHe entered the 2020 Australian Open seeded 6th in the men's bracket, but failed to repeat his success of 2019, losing in the 3rd round to Milos Raonic. He then entered the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament seeded 2nd, but failed to live up to his seed as he lost in the round of 16 to Aljaž Bedene. He recovered quickly to defend his title at the Open 13 tournament, winning his 5th ATP title, recording in the process 4 wins in a row without dropping a set, and defeating Félix Auger-Aliassime in the final. The following week he entered the Dubai Tennis Championships as the second seed behind Novak Djokovic. He recorded 4 wins in a row, reaching the final for the second successive year, where he lost in straight sets to the World No. 1.\n\n\nAt the US Open, he was seeded 4th in the men's bracket. He beat Albert Ramos Viñolas and Maxime Cressy without dropping a set before losing to Borna Ćorić in the third round despite having six match points and being a break up in the 5th set.\n\n\nAt the French Open, he was seeded 5th and reached the semifinal, defeating Grigor Dimitrov and Andrey Rublev, before losing to Djokovic in five sets.\n\n\nTsitsipas was unable to defend his 2019 ATP Finals title. He was eliminated from the season ending event with a 1–2 record during the round-robin portion of the competition, having defeated Andrey Rublev, but losing to Dominic Thiem and Rafael Nadal.[93]\n\n\n\n### 2021: French Open final, Masters 1000 champion, world No. 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas at the 2021 French Open\nTsitsipas started his 2021 Australian Open campaign with a comfortable straight sets win over Gilles Simon, before surviving a five set thriller with Thanasi Kokkinakis. He then beat Mikael Ymer in straight sets before being given a walkover by an injured Matteo Berrettini. In the quarterfinals, Tsitsipas became only the second player along with Fabio Fognini at the 2015 US Open to beat Rafael Nadal in a grand slam match from two sets to love down.[94] He eventually lost in the semifinals to Daniil Medvedev. In Rotterdam, Tsitsipas lost in the semifinals to the eventual champion Andrey Rublev.\n\n\nIn April, Tsitsipas won his first Masters 1000 title at the Monte-Carlo Masters, after defeating Aslan Karatsev, Cristian Garín, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Dan Evans and Andrey Rublev.[95] In doing so, Tsitsipas became the first Greek player in history to win a Masters title. In May, Tsitsipas defeated Cameron Norrie in straight sets to win the 2021 Lyon Open and his seventh career title.[96]\n\n\nAt the French Open, Tsitsipas beat Pablo Carreño Busta and Daniil Medvedev to reach his second consecutive French Open semifinal and third consecutive Grand Slam semifinal. He beat Alexander Zverev in five sets to become the first Greek player in history to reach a major final.[97] Tsitsipas achieved a career-high ranking of World No. 4 by advancing to the championship match.[98] There, he lost to world No.1 Novak Djokovic in five sets despite holding a two sets to love lead.[99]\n\n\nTsitsipas suffered an early exit at Wimbledon, losing to Frances Tiafoe in the first round. He took his revenge for the Wimbledon loss by defeating Tiafoe in the second round at the 2020 Olympics.[100][101] He became the first Greek man to win a singles match at the Olympic Games with his first round win over Philipp Kohlschreiber since Augustos Zerlandis in 1924.[102] He lost in the third round to Ugo Humbert of France in three sets.[103] At the US Open, Tsitsipas defeated Andy Murray in 5 sets and Adrian Mannarino in 4 sets to reach the third round. In the third round, he was defeated in 5 sets with a final set tiebreak by World No. 55 and 18 year-old Carlos Alcaraz.[104][105] At the 2021 BNP Paribas Open he reached the quarterfinals, beating Pedro Martínez, Fabio Fognini and Alex de Minaur before losing to Nikoloz Basilashvili.[106] At the ATP Finals, Tsitsipas lost in straight sets to Andrey Rublev before withdrawing from the tournament due to an elbow injury.\n\n\n\n#### Bathroom Break Controversy[edit]\n\n\nAt the US Open, he faced a backlash for taking extended bathroom breaks. In the Cincinnati Masters before the US Open, during a match against Alexander Zverev, Tsitsipas landed in a controversy for taking an extended toilet break after Zverev complained to the umpire about the situation. In the US Open, the controversy became worse, after Tsitsipas took a toilet break twice, when he was losing his first round match against Andy Murray, and even asked to stop the match while down in one of the games. Murray complained after the second toilet break, claiming that Tsitsipas's breaks are too long and change the momentum of the game. He claimed to have \"lost all respect\" for Tsitsipas, and later, after losing the match, wrote on Twitter, claiming that it takes Tsitsipas twice as long to go to the toilet as it takes Jeff Bezos to fly into space.[107][108]\n\n\n\n### 2022: 200th match win, first title on grass[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Australian Open, Tsitsipas reached the semifinals for the third time, where he faced Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of the previous year's semifinal. He lost in four sets, and received a coaching violation when his father Apostolos was caught coaching in Greek.[109]\n\n\nTsitsipas became the first man born in 1998 or later to get 200 career tour-level wins after defeating Laslo Đere in the first round at the 2022 Abierto Mexicano Telcel tournament.[110]\n\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas successfully defended his Monte-Carlo Masters title against Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in two sets to capture his second ATP Masters 1000 title.[111]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Italian Open he reached the quarterfinals, defeating Grigor Dimitrov in the second round, saving two match points in the process[112][113] and Karen Khachanov in the round of 16.[114] In the quarterfinals he defeated Jannik Sinner to reach his third straight semifinal at a Masters level, earning a tour-leading 30 wins for the season.[115] Next he defeated Alexander Zverev, his second consecutive win on clay, for a place in the final. Tsitsipas and Zverev were the only players to reach the semifinals at all three Masters 1000 tournaments on clay in the season.[116] In the finals, he lost to Novak Djokovic.[117]\n\n\nAfter some early losses in the Stuttgart Open and the Halle Open, Tsitsipas won his first title on grass courts after receiving a last minute wildcard at the Mallorca Open, defeating Roberto Bautista Agut in three tight sets.[118]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Wimbledon Championship, Tsitsipas lost in the third round to Nick Kyrgios in four sets.[119] In a fiery match, Tsitsipas was fined $10,000 for two code violations.[120]\n\n\nHe reached his third Masters 1000 final of the season but lost to the in-form and lowest ranked (No. 152) champion in Masters history Croatian Borna Ćorić.\nAt the 2022 US Open, Tsitsipas was seeded fourth. He was defeated by qualifier Daniel Elahi Galán in four sets in the first round, although Tsitsipas saved eight match points.[121]\n\n\nIn October, Tsitsipas reached the final of Astana Open, Kazakhstan, which he lost in straight sets to Novak Djokovic.[122] Next he reached his seventh final at the Stockholm Open but he was defeated by Holger Rune in straight sets.[123] He lost in the second round in Vienna again to Borna Ćorić. He recorded his 60th win for 2022 defeating Tommy Paul in the quarterfinals of the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters to reach his fifth Masters semifinal for the season.[124] In the semifinals, he lost to Novak Djokovic in three sets.[125]\n\n\nAt the 2022 ATP Finals he lost again to Djokovic, his ninth consecutive loss against the five-time season finale champion,[126] and Andrey Rublev, thus not being able to get past the round robin stage.[127]\n\n\nTsitsipas ended the year with a tournament win, the 2022 Mubadala World Tennis Championship.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Australian Open finalist, 300th career win[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas at the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters\nHe recorded his 250th win at the 2023 United Cup defeating Grigor Dimitrov.[128] At the 2023 Australian Open, Tsitsipas defeated Quentin Halys, Rinky Hijikata, Tallon Griekspoor, Jannik Sinner, Jiří Lehečka, and Karen Khachanov on his way to the final. The final was his second Grand Slam final following the 2021 French Open. In both finals, Tsitsipas lost to Novak Djokovic, who tied Rafael Nadal's record of 22 Grand Slam titles. If Tsitsipas had won, he would have clinched the world No.1 ranking for the first time.[129]\n\n\nTsitsipas returned to the Sunshine Double in the United States. At the Indian Wells Masters, he experienced an early first round loss to Jordan Thompson in three close sets. In Miami, he lost to Karen Khachanov in the fourth round in straight sets.\n\n\nHe started his clay-court campaign at the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters, where he was the two-time defending champion. He recorded 12 consecutive wins in the principality after defeating Benjamin Bonzi and Nicolás Jarry, but was ultimately defeated by American Taylor Fritz in straight sets in the quarterfinals. As a result, he dropped two spots to world No. 5. At the second clay court tournament of the year, the 2023 Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, he defeated Pedro Cachin, Denis Shapovalov, Alex de Minaur, and Lorenzo Musetti to reach the second final of the season and third Barcelona final overall. He lost to the top seed Carlos Alcaraz in the championship match in straight sets.\n\n\nFor the beginning of the grass season, he received wildcards for the 2023 BOSS Open[130] and the 2023 Halle Open[131] where he won one match, and at the 2023 Mallorca Championships where he was the defending champion.[132]\n\n\nIn August he won his tenth title at the 2023 Los Cabos Open, defeating John Isner, Nicolás Jarry, Borna Ćorić, and Alex de Minaur in straight sets in the final. Despite this result he dropped to world No. 7 on 21 August 2023 a week before the last Major of the season. At the 2023 US Open (tennis), he lost to No. 128 Swiss player Dominic Stricker in five sets in the second round. \nOn 2 November, in Paris, he recorded his 50th career win over Alexander Zverev for the season, only one of two players, male or female, to record 50 or more wins in each of the last three years, tied with Andrey Rublev. It was also his first top-10 win of the season.[133] With this win he qualified for his fifth consecutive ATP Finals. Next he defeated 16th seed Karen Khachanov to record the 300th win of his career with a straight sets victory in the quarterfinals. He became the first man born in 1998 and the seventh born in the 1990s or later to reach 300 career wins.[134][135]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas serving\nTsitsipas is an aggressive baseliner capable of an all-court player style as well, very similar to Roger Federer. He aims to hit powerful groundstroke winners and has a particularly strong forehand using an Eastern grip.[136] His forehand is particularly useful in finishing points off of the first serve, as combined with his big serve, he uses his high topspin rate to pull opponents off the court for winners, or go to the net more often than typical baseline players.[137] One of his weaknesses is to overhit and make unforced errors while trying to hit winners.[138][139] He also struggles returning serve against players with strong kick serves on the backhand side, a weakness he has worked to improve through usage of blocked and slice returns on his backhand.[140]\n\n\nHis favourite shot is his one-handed backhand, a rarity in modern tennis. His forehand is still his stronger swing, however. He experimented with both one-handed and two-handed backhands in his youth, but chose to go with the former at around eight years old because both of his parents as well as his idol Roger Federer all use a one-handed backhand, and also because it felt more natural. His favourite shot is the backhand down-the-line.[141][142]\n\n\nTsitsipas is regarded as having an all-court game.[143][25][137] His favourite surface is grass and Wimbledon is his favourite tournament.[144] Tsitsipas also excels on clay, having grown up playing on that surface in Greece. He has said, \"I feel very confident when I step on the dirt. I always show my best tennis on this surface.\"[19] Tsitsipas has also done well on hard courts, reaching two Masters finals (Canada, Cincinnati) and three Australian Open semifinals.[55][71]\n\n\nFormer British No. 1 players Greg Rusedski and Annabel Croft have both praised Tsitsipas's on-court demeanor in conjunction with his style of play. Rusedski in particular has said that \"[Tsitsipas] reminds me a little bit of Björn Borg. He does all the right things, he is spectacular as a tennis player and was just sensational with the way he was so calm and composed and he didn't blink when it came to the crunch. He has the competitive nature of Andy Murray, but he also has a calmness which reminds me of Roger Federer.\"[145]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tennis rivalries\n\n### Daniil Medvedev[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Tsitsipas rivalry\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Medvedev leading the rivalry, 9–4. They are considered to be two of the best tennis players of their generation.[*verification needed*] Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their next eight.[146]\n\n\n\n### Alexander Zverev[edit]\n\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Tsitsipas leading the rivalry 9–4. They are considered two of the best of their generation.[147] They have competed in five three-set matches, with Tsitsipas winning four of them, but Zverev won their most memorable three-set match, that being an epic at the 2021 Cincinnati Masters semifinal, in which Zverev prevailed 6–4, 3–6, 7–6(7–4).[148][149] Tsitsipas won their only Grand Slam match so far, in the 2021 French Open semifinals, winning in a five-set match with a scoreline of 6–3, 6–3, 4–6, 4–6, 6–3.[150][151]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsitsipas training with his father at the 2019 Laver Cup\nTsitsipas studied at an English-language school in his youth. He can speak English, Greek, and Russian.[16] He is a supporter of Greek football club AEK Athens.[152] Tsitsipas's hobbies include vlogging. He hosts his own YouTube channel where he posts videos of his travels.[153] He has been in a relationship with fellow tennis player Paula Badosa since May 2023.[154]\n\n\nTsitsipas credits his mother's twin sister, who was also a professional tennis player in the Soviet Union, with helping the family's finances so that he could afford to travel with his father to train and compete during his junior career.[10][155] His maternal grandfather Sergei Salnikov was an Olympic gold medal-winning member of the Soviet national football team and a former manager of FC Spartak Moscow.[9][11]\n\n\nDuring a Futures tournament in Crete, Tsitsipas nearly drowned while swimming at sea on an off-day. After a current carried him away from the shore, his father noticed what had happened and helped save his life. He attributes his confident approach of \"[feeling] absolutely zero fear on the court\" to the perspective he gained from this experience.[19]\n\n\nHe is a Greek Orthodox Christian.[156]\n\n\nTsitsipas has expressed interest in promoting the sport of tennis in Greece, where he has said \"tennis is not very popular.\"[10] After his finals appearance at the 2018 Barcelona Open, he commented that his success was helping him achieve this goal. Of his performance and the attention it received, he stated, \"Many people were talking about [the final] and I had plenty of interviews that I did on big channels in Greece for big media centres. It got people's attention... It makes me motivated to do even better in the future, and become even more popular... I hope to inspire more people to play tennis in Greece.\"[48]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stefanos Tsitsipas career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | Q2 | 1R | SF | 3R[A] | SF[A] | SF | F |  | 0 / 6\n | 21–6\n | 78%\n |\n| French Open | 1R | 2R | 4R | SF | F | 4R | QF |  | 0 / 7\n | 22–7\n | 76%\n |\n| Wimbledon | 1R | 4R | 1R | NH\n | 1R | 3R | 4R |  | 0 / 6\n | 8–6\n | 57%\n |\n| US Open | Q3 | 2R | 1R | 3R | 3R | 1R | 2R |  | 0 / 6\n | 6–6\n | 50%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–2\n | 5–4\n | 8–4\n | 8–3\n | 12–4\n | 10–4\n | 14–4\n |  | 0 / 25\n | 57–25\n | 70%\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tsitsipas received walkovers in the second round of the 2020 Australian Open and the fourth round of the 2021 Australian Open, which do not officially count as wins.\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 runners-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | French Open | Clay\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 7–6(8–6), 6–2, 3–6, 2–6, 4–6\n |\n| Loss\n | 2023 | Australian Open | Hard\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic\n | 3–6, 6–7(4–7), 6–7(5–7) |\n\n\n### Year-end championship finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 title)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win\n | 2019 | ATP Finals, London\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 6–7(6–8), 6–2, 7–6(7–4) |\n\n\n### ATP Masters 1000 finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 6 (2 titles, 4 runners-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2018 | Canadian Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 2–6, 6–7(4–7) |\n| Loss | 2019 | Madrid Open | Clay | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 4–6\n |\n| Win | 2021 | Monte-Carlo Masters | Clay | ![Russia](image) Andrey Rublev | 6–3, 6–3\n |\n| Win | 2022 | Monte-Carlo Masters (2) | Clay | ![Spain](image) Alejandro Davidovich Fokina | 6–3, 7–6(7–3) |\n| Loss | 2022 | Italian Open | Clay | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 0–6, 6–7(5–7) |\n| Loss | 2022 | Cincinnati Masters | Hard | ![Croatia](image) Borna Ćorić | 6–7(0–7), 2–6\n |\n\n\n#### Doubles: 1 (1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Partner\n | Opponents\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2019 | Miami Open | Hard\n | ![Netherlands](image) Wesley Koolhof | ![United States](image) Bob Bryan![United States](image) Mike Bryan | 5–7, 6–7(8–10) |\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n#### Open Era records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | Winner of Next Gen ATP Finals and ATP Finals in consecutive years | **Stands alone** |\n| 2019 | Won the ATP Finals title on debut | Àlex CorretjaGrigor DimitrovJohn McEnroeIlie NăstaseStan SmithGuillermo Vilas[157] |\n| 2022 | Defended his first ATP Masters 1000 title | Boris BeckerLleyton HewittRafael Nadal |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Stefanos Tsitsipas | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.
