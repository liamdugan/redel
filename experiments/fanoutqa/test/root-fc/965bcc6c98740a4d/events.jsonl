The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population,[13] was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.7 billion people[14] constitute roughly 60% of the world's population, having more people than all other continents combined.[15]\n\n\nAsia shares the landmass of Eurasia with Europe, and of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas, separating it from Europe.[16]\n\n\nChina and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1,800 CE. China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east,[17][18][19] and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia,[20] attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen.[21] Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions.\n\n\nGiven its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography.[*citation needed*] Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.\n\n\n\n\n## Definition and boundaries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information on Asian borders: Geography of Asia § Boundary, Boundaries between continents, List of transcontinental countries § Asia and Europe, and Copenhagen criteria\n\n### Asia–Africa boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe boundary between Asia and Africa is the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, and the Suez Canal.[22] This makes Egypt a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa.\n\n\n\n### Asia–Europe boundary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Definitions used for the boundary between Europe and Asia in different countries around the world\nThe threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.[*citation needed*] Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni river) in Georgia of Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on the Black Sea coast, through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE.[23] During the Hellenistic period,[24] this convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius,[25] Strabo[26] and Ptolemy.[27]\n\n\nThe border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.[28] The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great, king of the Tsardom of Russia, defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia, synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Ural Mountains as the border of Asia. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.[29] The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the Caucasus Mountains, although it is sometimes placed further north.[28]\n\n\n\n### Asia–Oceania boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe border between Asia and the region of Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Indonesia Archipelago. The Maluku Islands are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with Indonesian New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Indonesian Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, \"The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process.\"[30]\n\n\n\n### Asia–North America boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe Bering Strait and Bering Sea separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the United States. The Aleutian Islands are an island chain extending westward from the Alaskan Peninsula toward Russia's Komandorski Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost Near Islands group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the North Aleutians Basin and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of Alaska as well as the United States itself to be considered a transcontinental state. The Aleutian Islands are sometimes associated with Oceania, owing to their status as remote Pacific islands, and their proximity to the Pacific Plate.[31][32][33] This is extremely rare however, due to their non-tropical biogeography, as well as their inhabitants, who have historically been related to Indigenous Americans.[34][35]\n\n\nSt. Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the Rat Islands in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points, Alaska and Russia are separated by only 4 kilometres (2.5 miles).\n\n\n\n### Ongoing definition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Afro-Eurasia shown in green\nGeographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the Ancient Greeks, being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.[36]\n\n\nFrom the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them.[37] For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely \"the western excrescence of the continent of Asia\".[38]\n\n\nGeographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common continental shelf. Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ptolemy's Asia\nThe term \"Asia\" is believed to originate in the Bronze Age placename *Assuwa* (Hittite: 𒀸𒋗𒉿, romanized: *aš-šu-wa*) which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern Anatolia. The term appears in Hittite records recounting how a confederation of Assuwan states including Troy unsuccessfully rebelled against the Hittite king Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE.[39][40][41] Roughly contemporary Linear B documents contain the term *asiwia* (Mycenaean Greek: 𐀀𐀯𐀹𐀊, romanized: *a-si-wi-ja*), seemingly in reference to captives from the same area.[42][43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The province of Asia highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire\nHerodotus used the term Ἀσία in reference to Anatolia and the territory of the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt. He reports that Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus, but that Lydians say it was named after *Asies*, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis.[44] In Greek mythology, \"Asia\" (*Ἀσία*) or \"Asie\" (*Ἀσίη*) was the name of a \"Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia\".[45] The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning \"Asian\");[46] and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος.[47] According to many Muslims, the term came from Ancient Egypt's Queen Asiya, the adoptive mother of Moses.[48]\n\n\nThe term was later adopted by the Romans, who used it in reference to the province of Asia, located in western Anatolia.[49] One of the first writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was Pliny.[50]\n\n\nIn languages of the Chinese character cultural sphere words related to the character 亜細亜 Yàxìyà are used. This has been criticized as implying an inferiority of the continent as 亜 means inferior. However it is a mere phonetic representation.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Asia\n\n![](image)The Silk Road connected civilizations across Asia.[51]\n![](image)The Mongol Empire at its greatest extent. The gray area is the later Timurid Empire.\nThe history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East (West Asia), linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian steppes.\nThe coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Yellow River shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.\n\n\nThe central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the Tocharians resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of Siberia, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra. These areas remained very sparsely populated.\n\n\nThe center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.\n\n\nThe Islamic Caliphate's defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century. The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, Song dynasty reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.[52]\n\n\nThe Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road.[53]\n\n\nThe Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing dynasty. The Islamic Mughal Empire and the Hindu Maratha Empire controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.[54]\n\n\nWestern European colonisation of Asia coincided with the Industrial Revolution in the West and the dethroning of India and China as the world's foremost economies.[55] The British Empire became dominant in South Asia, with large parts of the region first being conquered by British traders before falling under direct British rule; extreme poverty doubled to over 50% during this era.[56] The Middle East was contested and partitioned by the British and French,[57] while Southeast Asia was carved up between the British, Dutch and French.[58] Various Western powers dominated China in what later became known as the \"century of humiliation\", with the British-supported opium trade and later Opium Wars resulting in China being forced into an unprecedented situation of importing more than it exported.[59][60] Foreign domination of China was furthered by the Empire of Japan, which controlled most of East Asia and much of Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands during this era; Japan's domination was enabled by its rapid rise that had taken place during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, in which it applied industrial knowledge learned from the West and thus overtook the rest of Asia.[61][62]\n\n\nWith the end of World War II in 1945 and the wartime ruination of Europe and imperial Japan, many countries in Asia were able to rapidly free themselves of colonial rule.[63] The independence of India came along with the carving out of a separate nation for the majority of Indian Muslims, which today has become the countries Pakistan and Bangladesh.[64]\n\n\nSome Arab countries took economic advantage of massive oil deposits that were discovered in their territory, becoming globally influential.[65] East Asian nations (along with Singapore in Southeast Asia) became economically prosperous with high-growth \"tiger economies\",[66] with China regaining its place among the top two economies of the world by the 21st century.[67] India has grown significantly because of economic liberalisation that started in the 1990s,[68] with extreme poverty now below 20%.[69]\n\n\n\n* ![The threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.](image)\n\nThe threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.\n* ![1825 map of Asia by Sidney Edwards Morse](image)\n\n1825 map of Asia by Sidney Edwards Morse\n* ![Map of western, southern, and central Asia in 1885[70]](image)\n\nMap of western, southern, and central Asia in 1885[70]\n* ![The map of Asia in 1796, which also included the continent of Australia (then known as New Holland)](image)\n\nThe map of Asia in 1796, which also included the continent of Australia (then known as New Holland)\n* ![1890 map of Asia](image)\n\n1890 map of Asia\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Asia\n\nSee also: Category:Biota of Asia\n\n![](image)The Himalayan range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.\nAsia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62,800 kilometres (39,022 mi). Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas.[16][71] It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a European nation, both culturally and politically.\n\n\nThe Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East. The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent. The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.\n\n\n\n* ![Siberian tundra](image)\n\nSiberian tundra\n* ![Rainforest in Borneo](image)\n\nRainforest in Borneo\n* ![Kerala backwaters](image)\n\nKerala backwaters\n* ![Mongolian steppe](image)\n\nMongolian steppe\n* ![South China Karst](image)\n\nSouth China Karst\n* ![Taman Negara, Peninsular Malaysia](image)\n\nTaman Negara, Peninsular Malaysia\n* ![Altai Mountains](image)\n\nAltai Mountains\n* ![Hunza Valley](image)\n\nHunza Valley\n* ![Atolls of the Maldives](image)\n\nAtolls of the Maldives\n* ![Wadi Rum in Jordan](image)\n\nWadi Rum in Jordan\n\n\n### Main regions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Division of Asia into regions by the UNSD * North Asia\n* Central Asia\n* West Asia (Near East)\n* South Asia\n* East Asia (Far East)\n* Southeast Asia\n\nThere are various approaches to the regional division of Asia. The following subdivision into regions is used, among others, by the UN statistics agency UNSD. This division of Asia into regions by the United Nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories.[72]\n\n\n\n* North Asia (Siberia)[note 4]\n* Central Asia (The 'stans)\n* West Asia (The Middle East or Near East and the Caucasus)\n* South Asia (Indian subcontinent)\n* East Asia (Far East)\n* Southeast Asia (East Indies and Indochina)\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Asia\n\n![](image)Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for Asia[73]\nAsia has extremely diverse climate features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan.\n\n\n\n#### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate change in South Asia, Climate change in Southeast Asia, Climate change in Central Asia, Climate change in East Asia, and Climate change in North Asia\n\nFurther information: Category:Climate change in Asia\n\nClimate change is having major impacts on many countries in the continent.\nA survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm Maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan, China and Sri Lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change.[74][75][76] Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a semi-arid climate, the temperature increased by 0.4 °C between 1901 and 2003.\nA 2013 study by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefiting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use renewable energy.[77]\n\n\nThe ten countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam – are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the world, however, ASEAN's climate mitigation efforts are not commensurate with the climate threats and risks it faces.[78]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Asia, List of Asian countries by GDP, List of countries in Asia-Pacific by GDP (nominal), and List of Asian and Pacific countries by GDP (PPP)\n\n![](image)Singapore has one of the busiest container ports in the world and is the world's fourth largest foreign exchange trading center.\nAsia has the largest continental economy in the world by both GDP nominal and PPP values, and is the fastest growing economic region.[79] As of 2023[update], China is by far the largest economy on the continent, making up nearly half of the continent's economy by GDP nominal. It is followed by Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which are all ranked amongst the top 20 largest economies both by nominal and PPP values.[80] Based on Global Office Locations 2011, Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in Asia: Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. Around 68 percent of international firms have an office in Hong Kong.[81]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of China[82] and India grew rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. Other recent very-high-growth nations in Asia include Israel, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and mineral-rich nations such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Brunei, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book *The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective*, India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE. Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century, contributing 25% of the world's industrial output.[83][84][85][86] China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with India.[87][18][88] For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1990 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or APEC). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy. It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2027.[79]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP by currency exchange rates was almost as large as that of the rest of Asia combined.[79] In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which are now all considered developed economies, having amongst the highest GDP per capita in Asia.[89][79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mumbai is one of the most populous cities on the continent. The city is an infrastructure and tourism hub, and plays a crucial role in the economy of India.\nAsia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Citigroup in 2011, 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth. They are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.[90] Asia has three main financial centers: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore. Call centers and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTrade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia. Individual main routes have emerged from this. The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Malé to East Africa Mombasa, from there to Djibouti, then through the Red Sea over the Suez Canal into Mediterranean, there via Haifa, Istanbul and Athens to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to Barcelona and around Spain and France to the European northern ports. A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South Africa to Europe. A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards Los Angeles and Long Beach. In contrast to the sea routes, the Silk Road via the land route to Europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope. Intra-Asian trade, including sea trade, is growing rapidly.[91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98]\n\n\nIn 2010, Asia had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires. Last year Asia had toppled Europe.[99]\nCitigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's \"economic center of gravity\" continued moving east. At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia, China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.[100]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (nominal, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) China | 17,700,899 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Japan | 4,230,862 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) India | 3,732,224 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia | 1,862,470 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) South Korea | 1,709,232 | 2021\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Indonesia | 1,417,387 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Turkey | 1,154,600 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 1,069,437 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Taiwan | 751,930 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Israel | 521,688 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (PPP, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) China | 32,897,929 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) India | 13,119,622 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Japan | 6,495,214 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia[101] | 5,326,855 | 2022\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Indonesia | 4,393,370 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Turkey | 3,613,540 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) South Korea | 2,924,189 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 2,246,535 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Egypt | 1,809,425 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Iran | 1,725,874 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![A Thai temple complex with several ornate buildings, and a lot of visitors](image)Wat Phra Kaew in the Grand Palace is among Bangkok's major tourist attractions.\nSee also the categories Tourism in Asia and Transport in Asia\n\nWith growing Regional Tourism with domination of Chinese visitors, MasterCard has released Global Destination Cities Index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by Asia and Pacific Region Cities and also for the first time a city of a country from Asia (Bangkok) set in the top-ranked with 15.98 million international visitors.[102]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Asia\n\nSee also: List of Asian countries by population and List of Asian countries by life expectancy\n\n\n\nHistorical populations| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1500  | 243,000,000 | —     |\n| 1700  | 436,000,000 | +0.29% |\n| 1900  | 947,000,000 | +0.39% |\n| 1950  | 1,402,000,000 | +0.79% |\n| 1999  | 3,634,000,000 | +1.96% |\n| 2016 | 4,462,676,731 | +1.22% |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since\n1970, is the only country on the \"Top 10 Movers\" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.[103]\n  \nNepal, a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.[103]\n  \n Hong Kong ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 7 in the world, which is in the \"very high human development\" category), followed by Singapore (9), Japan (19) and South Korea (22). Afghanistan (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.[103]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Asia\n\nAsia is home to several language families and many language isolates. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to Ethnologue, more than 700 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 400 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.\n\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eastern philosophy, Religion in Asia, and List of Asian mythologies\n\nMany of the world's major religions have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding irreligion), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Jews in the Hebrew Bible in the narrative of Noah—and later to Christians in the Old Testament, and to Muslims in the Quran—is earliest found in Mesopotamian mythology, in the Enûma Eliš and *Epic of Gilgamesh*. Hindu mythology similarly tells about an avatar of Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood. Ancient Chinese mythology also tells of a Great Flood spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.\n\n\n\n#### Abrahamic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Christianity in Asia and Islam in Asia\n\n![](image)The Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem\n![](image)The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem\n![](image)Pilgrims in the annual Hajj at the Kaabah in Mecca\nThe Abrahamic religions including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Druze faith,[104] and Baháʼí Faith originated in West Asia.[105][106]\n\n\nJudaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel, the indigenous homeland and historical birthplace of the Hebrew nation: which today consists both of those Jews who remained in the Middle East and those who returned from diaspora in Europe, North America, and other regions;[107] though various diaspora communities persist worldwide. Jews are the predominant ethnic group in Israel (75.6%) numbering at about 6.1 million,[108] although the levels of adherence to Jewish religion vary. Outside of Israel there are small ancient Jewish communities in Turkey (17,400),[109] Azerbaijan (9,100),[110] Iran (8,756),[111] India (5,000) and Uzbekistan (4,000),[112] among many other places. In total, there are 14.4–17.5 million (2016, est.)[113] Jews alive in the world today, making them one of the smallest Asian minorities, at roughly 0.3 to 0.4 percent of the total population of the continent.\n\n\nChristianity is a widespread religion in Asia with more than 286 million adherents according to Pew Research Center in 2010,[114] and nearly 364 million according to Britannica Book of the Year 2014.[115] Constituting around 12.6% of the total population of Asia. In the Philippines and East Timor, Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion;[116] it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively. In Armenia and Georgia, Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion.[116] In the Middle East, such as in the Levant, Anatolia and Fars, Syriac Christianity (Church of the East) and Oriental Orthodoxy are prevalent minority denominations,[117] which are both Eastern Christian sects mainly adhered to Assyrian people or Syriac Christians. Vibrant indigenous minorities in West Asia are adhering to the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodoxy.[116] Saint Thomas Christians in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.[118] Significant Christian communities also found in Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia.[116]\n\n\nIslam, which originated in the Hejaz located in modern-day Saudi Arabia, is the second largest and most widely-spread religion in Asia with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of Asia.[119] With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia, followed by Pakistan (11.5%), India (10%), Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey. Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are the three holiest cities for Islam in all the world. The Hajj and Umrah attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina. Iran is the largest Shi'a country.\n\n\nThe Druze Faith or Druzism originated in West Asia, is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of figures like Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. The number of Druze people worldwide is around one million, with about 45% to 50% live in Syria, 35% to 40% live in Lebanon, and less than 10% live in Israel, with recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora.[120]\n\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Baháʼí activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities. Lotus Temple is a big Baháʼí Temple in India.\n\n\n\n#### Indian and East Asian religions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple in Delhi, according to the Guinness World Records, is the *World's Largest Comprehensive Hindu Temple*.[121]\nAlmost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, Cārvāka, preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, Confucianism, Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape.\n\n\nAs of 2012[update], Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali, Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hindu-Buddhist temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the largest religious monument in the world\nBuddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia. Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia (96%),[122] Thailand (95%),[123] Burma (80–89%),[124] Japan (36–96%),[125] Bhutan (75–84%),[126] Sri Lanka (70%),[127] Laos (60–67%)[128] and Mongolia (53–93%).[129] Taiwan (35–93%),[130][131][132][133] South Korea (23–50%),[134] Malaysia (19–21%),[135] Nepal (9–11%),[136] Vietnam (10–75%),[137] China (20–50%),[138] North Korea (2–14%),[139][140][141] and small communities in India and Bangladesh. The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.\n\n\nJainism is found mainly in India and in overseas Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia. Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia. Confucianism is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations. Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. In many Chinese communities, Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism, thus exact religious statistics are difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.\n\n\n\n* ![Japanese wedding at the Meiji Shrine](image)\n\nJapanese wedding at the Meiji Shrine\n* ![Hindu festival celebrated by Singapore's Tamil community](image)\n\nHindu festival celebrated by Singapore's Tamil community\n* ![Bar mitzvah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem](image)\n\nBar mitzvah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem\n* ![Catholic procession of the Black Nazarene in Manila](image)\n\nCatholic procession of the Black Nazarene in Manila\n* ![Druze dignitaries celebrating the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb festival at the tomb of the prophet in Hittin](image)\n\nDruze dignitaries celebrating the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb festival at the tomb of the prophet in Hittin\n* ![Christian Armenians praying at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat](image)\n\nChristian Armenians praying at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat\n* ![Muslim men praying at the Ortaköy Mosque in Istanbul](image)\n\nMuslim men praying at the Ortaköy Mosque in Istanbul\n* ![Buddhist Monks performing traditional Sand mandala made from coloured sand](image)\n\nBuddhist Monks performing traditional Sand mandala made from coloured sand\n\n\n## Modern conflicts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A refugee special train in Ambala, Punjab during the partition of India in 1947\n![](image)US forces drop Napalm on suspected Viet Cong positions in 1965.\n![](image)Wounded civilians arrive at a hospital in Aleppo during the Syrian Civil War, October 2012.\n![](image)Demonstrations in Hong Kong against the Extradition bill began in March 2019 and turned into continuing mass movements, drawing around 2 million protesters by June\nSome of the events pivotal in the Asia territory related to the relationship with the outside world in the post-Second World War were:\n\n\n\n* The Partition of India\n* The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948\n* The Chinese Civil War\n* The Kashmir conflict\n* The Balochistan Conflict\n* The Naxalite–Maoist insurgency in India\n* The Korean War\n* The French Indochina War\n* The Vietnam War\n* The Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation\n* The 1959 Tibetan uprising\n* The Sino-Vietnamese War\n* The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971\n* The Bangladesh Liberation War\n* The Yom Kippur War\n* The Indo-Pakistani war of 1965\n* The Xinjiang conflict\n* The Iranian Revolution\n* The Soviet–Afghan War\n* The Iran–Iraq War\n* The Cambodian Killing Fields\n* The Insurgency in Laos\n* The Lebanese Civil War\n* The Sri Lankan Civil War\n* The 1988 Maldives coup d'état\n* The Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n* The Gulf War\n* The Nepalese Civil War\n* The Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts\n* The West Papua conflict\n* The First Nagorno-Karabakh War\n* The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests\n* The Indonesian occupation of East Timor\n* The Kargil War\n* The 1999 Pakistani coup d'état\n* The War in Afghanistan\n* The Iraq War\n* The South Thailand insurgency\n* The 2006 Thai coup d'état\n* The Burmese Civil War\n* The Saffron Revolution\n* The Kurdish–Turkish conflict\n* The Arab Spring\n* The Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n* The Arab–Israeli conflict\n* The Syrian Civil War\n* The Sino-Indian War\n* The 2014 Thai coup d'état\n* The Moro conflict in the Philippines\n* The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n* The Turkish invasion of Syria\n* The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar\n* The Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen\n* The Hong Kong protests\n* The 2020 China–India skirmishes\n* The Sino-Indian border dispute\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Asia\n\nThe culture of Asia is a diverse blend of customs and traditions that have been practiced by the various ethnic groups of the continent for centuries. The continent is divided into six geographic sub-regions: Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia.[142] These regions are defined by their cultural similarities, including common religions, languages, and ethnicities. West Asia, also known as Southwest Asia or the Middle East, has cultural roots in the ancient civilizations of the Fertile Crescent and Mesopotamia, which gave rise to the Persian, Arab, Ottoman empires, as well as the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.[143] These civilizations, which are located in the Hilly flanks, are among the oldest in the world, with evidence of farming dating back to around 9000 BCE.[144] Despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges, trade and commerce have helped to create a Pan-Asian culture that is shared across the region.[145]\n\n\n\n### Nobel prizes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Indian polymath Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, and became Asia's first Nobel laureate.\nThe polymath Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali poet, dramatist, and writer from Santiniketan, now in West Bengal, India, became in 1913 the first Asian Nobel laureate. He won his Nobel Prize in Literature for notable impact his prose works and poetic thought had on English, French, and other national literatures of Europe and the Americas. He is also the writer of the national anthems of Bangladesh and India.\n\n\nOther Asian writers who won Nobel Prize for literature include Yasunari Kawabata (Japan, 1968), Kenzaburō Ōe (Japan, 1994), Gao Xingjian (China, 2000), Orhan Pamuk (Turkey, 2006), and Mo Yan (China, 2012). Some may consider the American writer, Pearl S. Buck, an honorary Asian Nobel laureate, having spent considerable time in China as the daughter of missionaries, and based many of her novels, namely *The Good Earth* (1931) and *The Mother* (1933), as well as the biographies of her parents for their time in China, *The Exile* and *Fighting Angel*, all of which earned her the Literature prize in 1938.\n\n\nAlso, Mother Teresa of India and Shirin Ebadi of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children. Ebadi is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize. Another Nobel Peace Prize winner is Aung San Suu Kyi from Burma for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a military dictatorship in Burma. She is a nonviolent pro-democracy activist and leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma (Myanmar) and a noted prisoner of conscience. She is a Buddhist and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for \"his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China\" on 8 October 2010. He is the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China. In 2014, Kailash Satyarthi from India and Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education\".\n\n\nSir C.V. Raman is the first Asian to get a Nobel prize in Sciences. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him\".\n\n\nJapan has won the most Nobel Prizes of any Asian nation with 24 followed by India which has won 13.\n\n\nAmartya Sen, (born 3 November 1933) is an Indian economist who was awarded the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory, and for his interest in the problems of society's poorest members.\n\n\nOther Asian Nobel Prize winners include Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Abdus Salam, Malala Yousafzai, Robert Aumann, Menachem Begin, Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko, Daniel Kahneman, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, Ada Yonath, Yasser Arafat, José Ramos-Horta and Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo of Timor Leste, Kim Dae-jung, and 13 Japanese scientists. Most of the said awardees are from Japan and Israel except for Chandrasekhar and Raman (India), Abdus Salam and Malala Yousafzai, (Pakistan), Arafat (Palestinian Territories), Kim (South Korea), and Horta and Belo (Timor Leste).\n\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the establishment of Grameen Bank, a community development bank that lends money to poor people, especially women in Bangladesh. Dr. Yunus received his PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University, United States. He is internationally known for the concept of micro credit which allows poor and destitute people with little or no collateral to borrow money. The borrowers typically pay back money within the specified period and the incidence of default is very low.\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama has received approximately eighty-four awards over his spiritual and political career.[146] On 22 June 2006, he became one of only four people ever to be recognized with Honorary Citizenship by the Governor General of Canada. On 28 May 2005, he received the Christmas Humphreys Award from the Buddhist Society in the United Kingdom.

The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population,[13] was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.7 billion people[14] constitute roughly 60% of the world's population, having more people than all other continents combined.[15]\n\n\nAsia shares the landmass of Eurasia with Europe, and of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas, separating it from Europe.[16]\n\n\nChina and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1,800 CE. China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east,[17][18][19] and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia,[20] attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen.[21] Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions.\n\n\nGiven its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography.[*citation needed*] Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.\n\n\n\n\n## Definition and boundaries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information on Asian borders: Geography of Asia § Boundary, Boundaries between continents, List of transcontinental countries § Asia and Europe, and Copenhagen criteria\n\n### Asia–Africa boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe boundary between Asia and Africa is the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, and the Suez Canal.[22] This makes Egypt a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa.\n\n\n\n### Asia–Europe boundary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Definitions used for the boundary between Europe and Asia in different countries around the world\nThe threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.[*citation needed*] Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni river) in Georgia of Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on the Black Sea coast, through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE.[23] During the Hellenistic period,[24] this convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius,[25] Strabo[26] and Ptolemy.[27]\n\n\nThe border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.[28] The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great, king of the Tsardom of Russia, defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia, synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Ural Mountains as the border of Asia. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.[29] The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the Caucasus Mountains, although it is sometimes placed further north.[28]\n\n\n\n### Asia–Oceania boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe border between Asia and the region of Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Indonesia Archipelago. The Maluku Islands are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with Indonesian New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Indonesian Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, \"The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process.\"[30]\n\n\n\n### Asia–North America boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe Bering Strait and Bering Sea separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the United States. The Aleutian Islands are an island chain extending westward from the Alaskan Peninsula toward Russia's Komandorski Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost Near Islands group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the North Aleutians Basin and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of Alaska as well as the United States itself to be considered a transcontinental state. The Aleutian Islands are sometimes associated with Oceania, owing to their status as remote Pacific islands, and their proximity to the Pacific Plate.[31][32][33] This is extremely rare however, due to their non-tropical biogeography, as well as their inhabitants, who have historically been related to Indigenous Americans.[34][35]\n\n\nSt. Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the Rat Islands in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points, Alaska and Russia are separated by only 4 kilometres (2.5 miles).\n\n\n\n### Ongoing definition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Afro-Eurasia shown in green\nGeographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the Ancient Greeks, being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.[36]\n\n\nFrom the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them.[37] For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely \"the western excrescence of the continent of Asia\".[38]\n\n\nGeographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common continental shelf. Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ptolemy's Asia\nThe term \"Asia\" is believed to originate in the Bronze Age placename *Assuwa* (Hittite: 𒀸𒋗𒉿, romanized: *aš-šu-wa*) which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern Anatolia. The term appears in Hittite records recounting how a confederation of Assuwan states including Troy unsuccessfully rebelled against the Hittite king Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE.[39][40][41] Roughly contemporary Linear B documents contain the term *asiwia* (Mycenaean Greek: 𐀀𐀯𐀹𐀊, romanized: *a-si-wi-ja*), seemingly in reference to captives from the same area.[42][43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The province of Asia highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire\nHerodotus used the term Ἀσία in reference to Anatolia and the territory of the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt. He reports that Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus, but that Lydians say it was named after *Asies*, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis.[44] In Greek mythology, \"Asia\" (*Ἀσία*) or \"Asie\" (*Ἀσίη*) was the name of a \"Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia\".[45] The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning \"Asian\");[46] and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος.[47] According to many Muslims, the term came from Ancient Egypt's Queen Asiya, the adoptive mother of Moses.[48]\n\n\nThe term was later adopted by the Romans, who used it in reference to the province of Asia, located in western Anatolia.[49] One of the first writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was Pliny.[50]\n\n\nIn languages of the Chinese character cultural sphere words related to the character 亜細亜 Yàxìyà are used. This has been criticized as implying an inferiority of the continent as 亜 means inferior. However it is a mere phonetic representation.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Asia\n\n![](image)The Silk Road connected civilizations across Asia.[51]\n![](image)The Mongol Empire at its greatest extent. The gray area is the later Timurid Empire.\nThe history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East (West Asia), linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian steppes.\nThe coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Yellow River shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.\n\n\nThe central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the Tocharians resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of Siberia, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra. These areas remained very sparsely populated.\n\n\nThe center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.\n\n\nThe Islamic Caliphate's defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century. The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, Song dynasty reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.[52]\n\n\nThe Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road.[53]\n\n\nThe Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing dynasty. The Islamic Mughal Empire and the Hindu Maratha Empire controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.[54]\n\n\nWestern European colonisation of Asia coincided with the Industrial Revolution in the West and the dethroning of India and China as the world's foremost economies.[55] The British Empire became dominant in South Asia, with large parts of the region first being conquered by British traders before falling under direct British rule; extreme poverty doubled to over 50% during this era.[56] The Middle East was contested and partitioned by the British and French,[57] while Southeast Asia was carved up between the British, Dutch and French.[58] Various Western powers dominated China in what later became known as the \"century of humiliation\", with the British-supported opium trade and later Opium Wars resulting in China being forced into an unprecedented situation of importing more than it exported.[59][60] Foreign domination of China was furthered by the Empire of Japan, which controlled most of East Asia and much of Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands during this era; Japan's domination was enabled by its rapid rise that had taken place during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, in which it applied industrial knowledge learned from the West and thus overtook the rest of Asia.[61][62]\n\n\nWith the end of World War II in 1945 and the wartime ruination of Europe and imperial Japan, many countries in Asia were able to rapidly free themselves of colonial rule.[63] The independence of India came along with the carving out of a separate nation for the majority of Indian Muslims, which today has become the countries Pakistan and Bangladesh.[64]\n\n\nSome Arab countries took economic advantage of massive oil deposits that were discovered in their territory, becoming globally influential.[65] East Asian nations (along with Singapore in Southeast Asia) became economically prosperous with high-growth \"tiger economies\",[66] with China regaining its place among the top two economies of the world by the 21st century.[67] India has grown significantly because of economic liberalisation that started in the 1990s,[68] with extreme poverty now below 20%.[69]\n\n\n\n* ![The threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.](image)\n\nThe threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.\n* ![1825 map of Asia by Sidney Edwards Morse](image)\n\n1825 map of Asia by Sidney Edwards Morse\n* ![Map of western, southern, and central Asia in 1885[70]](image)\n\nMap of western, southern, and central Asia in 1885[70]\n* ![The map of Asia in 1796, which also included the continent of Australia (then known as New Holland)](image)\n\nThe map of Asia in 1796, which also included the continent of Australia (then known as New Holland)\n* ![1890 map of Asia](image)\n\n1890 map of Asia\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Asia\n\nSee also: Category:Biota of Asia\n\n![](image)The Himalayan range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.\nAsia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62,800 kilometres (39,022 mi). Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas.[16][71] It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a European nation, both culturally and politically.\n\n\nThe Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East. The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent. The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.\n\n\n\n* ![Siberian tundra](image)\n\nSiberian tundra\n* ![Rainforest in Borneo](image)\n\nRainforest in Borneo\n* ![Kerala backwaters](image)\n\nKerala backwaters\n* ![Mongolian steppe](image)\n\nMongolian steppe\n* ![South China Karst](image)\n\nSouth China Karst\n* ![Taman Negara, Peninsular Malaysia](image)\n\nTaman Negara, Peninsular Malaysia\n* ![Altai Mountains](image)\n\nAltai Mountains\n* ![Hunza Valley](image)\n\nHunza Valley\n* ![Atolls of the Maldives](image)\n\nAtolls of the Maldives\n* ![Wadi Rum in Jordan](image)\n\nWadi Rum in Jordan\n\n\n### Main regions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Division of Asia into regions by the UNSD * North Asia\n* Central Asia\n* West Asia (Near East)\n* South Asia\n* East Asia (Far East)\n* Southeast Asia\n\nThere are various approaches to the regional division of Asia. The following subdivision into regions is used, among others, by the UN statistics agency UNSD. This division of Asia into regions by the United Nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories.[72]\n\n\n\n* North Asia (Siberia)[note 4]\n* Central Asia (The 'stans)\n* West Asia (The Middle East or Near East and the Caucasus)\n* South Asia (Indian subcontinent)\n* East Asia (Far East)\n* Southeast Asia (East Indies and Indochina)\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Asia\n\n![](image)Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for Asia[73]\nAsia has extremely diverse climate features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan.\n\n\n\n#### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate change in South Asia, Climate change in Southeast Asia, Climate change in Central Asia, Climate change in East Asia, and Climate change in North Asia\n\nFurther information: Category:Climate change in Asia\n\nClimate change is having major impacts on many countries in the continent.\nA survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm Maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan, China and Sri Lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change.[74][75][76] Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a semi-arid climate, the temperature increased by 0.4 °C between 1901 and 2003.\nA 2013 study by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefiting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use renewable energy.[77]\n\n\nThe ten countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam – are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the world, however, ASEAN's climate mitigation efforts are not commensurate with the climate threats and risks it faces.[78]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Asia, List of Asian countries by GDP, List of countries in Asia-Pacific by GDP (nominal), and List of Asian and Pacific countries by GDP (PPP)\n\n![](image)Singapore has one of the busiest container ports in the world and is the world's fourth largest foreign exchange trading center.\nAsia has the largest continental economy in the world by both GDP nominal and PPP values, and is the fastest growing economic region.[79] As of 2023[update], China is by far the largest economy on the continent, making up nearly half of the continent's economy by GDP nominal. It is followed by Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which are all ranked amongst the top 20 largest economies both by nominal and PPP values.[80] Based on Global Office Locations 2011, Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in Asia: Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. Around 68 percent of international firms have an office in Hong Kong.[81]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of China[82] and India grew rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. Other recent very-high-growth nations in Asia include Israel, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and mineral-rich nations such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Brunei, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book *The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective*, India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE. Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century, contributing 25% of the world's industrial output.[83][84][85][86] China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with India.[87][18][88] For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1990 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or APEC). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy. It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2027.[79]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP by currency exchange rates was almost as large as that of the rest of Asia combined.[79] In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which are now all considered developed economies, having amongst the highest GDP per capita in Asia.[89][79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mumbai is one of the most populous cities on the continent. The city is an infrastructure and tourism hub, and plays a crucial role in the economy of India.\nAsia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Citigroup in 2011, 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth. They are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.[90] Asia has three main financial centers: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore. Call centers and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTrade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia. Individual main routes have emerged from this. The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Malé to East Africa Mombasa, from there to Djibouti, then through the Red Sea over the Suez Canal into Mediterranean, there via Haifa, Istanbul and Athens to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to Barcelona and around Spain and France to the European northern ports. A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South Africa to Europe. A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards Los Angeles and Long Beach. In contrast to the sea routes, the Silk Road via the land route to Europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope. Intra-Asian trade, including sea trade, is growing rapidly.[91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98]\n\n\nIn 2010, Asia had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires. Last year Asia had toppled Europe.[99]\nCitigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's \"economic center of gravity\" continued moving east. At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia, China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.[100]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (nominal, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) China | 17,700,899 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Japan | 4,230,862 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) India | 3,732,224 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia | 1,862,470 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) South Korea | 1,709,232 | 2021\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Indonesia | 1,417,387 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Turkey | 1,154,600 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 1,069,437 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Taiwan | 751,930 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Israel | 521,688 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (PPP, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) China | 32,897,929 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) India | 13,119,622 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Japan | 6,495,214 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia[101] | 5,326,855 | 2022\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Indonesia | 4,393,370 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Turkey | 3,613,540 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) South Korea | 2,924,189 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 2,246,535 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Egypt | 1,809,425 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Iran | 1,725,874 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![A Thai temple complex with several ornate buildings, and a lot of visitors](image)Wat Phra Kaew in the Grand Palace is among Bangkok's major tourist attractions.\nSee also the categories Tourism in Asia and Transport in Asia\n\nWith growing Regional Tourism with domination of Chinese visitors, MasterCard has released Global Destination Cities Index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by Asia and Pacific Region Cities and also for the first time a city of a country from Asia (Bangkok) set in the top-ranked with 15.98 million international visitors.[102]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Asia\n\nSee also: List of Asian countries by population and List of Asian countries by life expectancy\n\n\n\nHistorical populations| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1500  | 243,000,000 | —     |\n| 1700  | 436,000,000 | +0.29% |\n| 1900  | 947,000,000 | +0.39% |\n| 1950  | 1,402,000,000 | +0.79% |\n| 1999  | 3,634,000,000 | +1.96% |\n| 2016 | 4,462,676,731 | +1.22% |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since\n1970, is the only country on the \"Top 10 Movers\" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.[103]\n  \nNepal, a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.[103]\n  \n Hong Kong ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 7 in the world, which is in the \"very high human development\" category), followed by Singapore (9), Japan (19) and South Korea (22). Afghanistan (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.[103]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Asia\n\nAsia is home to several language families and many language isolates. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to Ethnologue, more than 700 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 400 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.\n\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eastern philosophy, Religion in Asia, and List of Asian mythologies\n\nMany of the world's major religions have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding irreligion), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Jews in the Hebrew Bible in the narrative of Noah—and later to Christians in the Old Testament, and to Muslims in the Quran—is earliest found in Mesopotamian mythology, in the Enûma Eliš and *Epic of Gilgamesh*. Hindu mythology similarly tells about an avatar of Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood. Ancient Chinese mythology also tells of a Great Flood spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.\n\n\n\n#### Abrahamic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Christianity in Asia and Islam in Asia\n\n![](image)The Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem\n![](image)The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem\n![](image)Pilgrims in the annual Hajj at the Kaabah in Mecca\nThe Abrahamic religions including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Druze faith,[104] and Baháʼí Faith originated in West Asia.[105][106]\n\n\nJudaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel, the indigenous homeland and historical birthplace of the Hebrew nation: which today consists both of those Jews who remained in the Middle East and those who returned from diaspora in Europe, North America, and other regions;[107] though various diaspora communities persist worldwide. Jews are the predominant ethnic group in Israel (75.6%) numbering at about 6.1 million,[108] although the levels of adherence to Jewish religion vary. Outside of Israel there are small ancient Jewish communities in Turkey (17,400),[109] Azerbaijan (9,100),[110] Iran (8,756),[111] India (5,000) and Uzbekistan (4,000),[112] among many other places. In total, there are 14.4–17.5 million (2016, est.)[113] Jews alive in the world today, making them one of the smallest Asian minorities, at roughly 0.3 to 0.4 percent of the total population of the continent.\n\n\nChristianity is a widespread religion in Asia with more than 286 million adherents according to Pew Research Center in 2010,[114] and nearly 364 million according to Britannica Book of the Year 2014.[115] Constituting around 12.6% of the total population of Asia. In the Philippines and East Timor, Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion;[116] it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively. In Armenia and Georgia, Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion.[116] In the Middle East, such as in the Levant, Anatolia and Fars, Syriac Christianity (Church of the East) and Oriental Orthodoxy are prevalent minority denominations,[117] which are both Eastern Christian sects mainly adhered to Assyrian people or Syriac Christians. Vibrant indigenous minorities in West Asia are adhering to the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodoxy.[116] Saint Thomas Christians in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.[118] Significant Christian communities also found in Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia.[116]\n\n\nIslam, which originated in the Hejaz located in modern-day Saudi Arabia, is the second largest and most widely-spread religion in Asia with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of Asia.[119] With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia, followed by Pakistan (11.5%), India (10%), Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey. Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are the three holiest cities for Islam in all the world. The Hajj and Umrah attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina. Iran is the largest Shi'a country.\n\n\nThe Druze Faith or Druzism originated in West Asia, is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of figures like Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. The number of Druze people worldwide is around one million, with about 45% to 50% live in Syria, 35% to 40% live in Lebanon, and less than 10% live in Israel, with recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora.[120]\n\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Baháʼí activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities. Lotus Temple is a big Baháʼí Temple in India.\n\n\n\n#### Indian and East Asian religions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple in Delhi, according to the Guinness World Records, is the *World's Largest Comprehensive Hindu Temple*.[121]\nAlmost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, Cārvāka, preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, Confucianism, Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape.\n\n\nAs of 2012[update], Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali, Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hindu-Buddhist temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the largest religious monument in the world\nBuddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia. Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia (96%),[122] Thailand (95%),[123] Burma (80–89%),[124] Japan (36–96%),[125] Bhutan (75–84%),[126] Sri Lanka (70%),[127] Laos (60–67%)[128] and Mongolia (53–93%).[129] Taiwan (35–93%),[130][131][132][133] South Korea (23–50%),[134] Malaysia (19–21%),[135] Nepal (9–11%),[136] Vietnam (10–75%),[137] China (20–50%),[138] North Korea (2–14%),[139][140][141] and small communities in India and Bangladesh. The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.\n\n\nJainism is found mainly in India and in overseas Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia. Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia. Confucianism is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations. Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. In many Chinese communities, Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism, thus exact religious statistics are difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.\n\n\n\n* ![Japanese wedding at the Meiji Shrine](image)\n\nJapanese wedding at the Meiji Shrine\n* ![Hindu festival celebrated by Singapore's Tamil community](image)\n\nHindu festival celebrated by Singapore's Tamil community\n* ![Bar mitzvah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem](image)\n\nBar mitzvah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem\n* ![Catholic procession of the Black Nazarene in Manila](image)\n\nCatholic procession of the Black Nazarene in Manila\n* ![Druze dignitaries celebrating the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb festival at the tomb of the prophet in Hittin](image)\n\nDruze dignitaries celebrating the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb festival at the tomb of the prophet in Hittin\n* ![Christian Armenians praying at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat](image)\n\nChristian Armenians praying at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat\n* ![Muslim men praying at the Ortaköy Mosque in Istanbul](image)\n\nMuslim men praying at the Ortaköy Mosque in Istanbul\n* ![Buddhist Monks performing traditional Sand mandala made from coloured sand](image)\n\nBuddhist Monks performing traditional Sand mandala made from coloured sand\n\n\n## Modern conflicts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A refugee special train in Ambala, Punjab during the partition of India in 1947\n![](image)US forces drop Napalm on suspected Viet Cong positions in 1965.\n![](image)Wounded civilians arrive at a hospital in Aleppo during the Syrian Civil War, October 2012.\n![](image)Demonstrations in Hong Kong against the Extradition bill began in March 2019 and turned into continuing mass movements, drawing around 2 million protesters by June\nSome of the events pivotal in the Asia territory related to the relationship with the outside world in the post-Second World War were:\n\n\n\n* The Partition of India\n* The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948\n* The Chinese Civil War\n* The Kashmir conflict\n* The Balochistan Conflict\n* The Naxalite–Maoist insurgency in India\n* The Korean War\n* The French Indochina War\n* The Vietnam War\n* The Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation\n* The 1959 Tibetan uprising\n* The Sino-Vietnamese War\n* The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971\n* The Bangladesh Liberation War\n* The Yom Kippur War\n* The Indo-Pakistani war of 1965\n* The Xinjiang conflict\n* The Iranian Revolution\n* The Soviet–Afghan War\n* The Iran–Iraq War\n* The Cambodian Killing Fields\n* The Insurgency in Laos\n* The Lebanese Civil War\n* The Sri Lankan Civil War\n* The 1988 Maldives coup d'état\n* The Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n* The Gulf War\n* The Nepalese Civil War\n* The Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts\n* The West Papua conflict\n* The First Nagorno-Karabakh War\n* The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests\n* The Indonesian occupation of East Timor\n* The Kargil War\n* The 1999 Pakistani coup d'état\n* The War in Afghanistan\n* The Iraq War\n* The South Thailand insurgency\n* The 2006 Thai coup d'état\n* The Burmese Civil War\n* The Saffron Revolution\n* The Kurdish–Turkish conflict\n* The Arab Spring\n* The Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n* The Arab–Israeli conflict\n* The Syrian Civil War\n* The Sino-Indian War\n* The 2014 Thai coup d'état\n* The Moro conflict in the Philippines\n* The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n* The Turkish invasion of Syria\n* The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar\n* The Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen\n* The Hong Kong protests\n* The 2020 China–India skirmishes\n* The Sino-Indian border dispute\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Asia\n\nThe culture of Asia is a diverse blend of customs and traditions that have been practiced by the various ethnic groups of the continent for centuries. The continent is divided into six geographic sub-regions: Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia.[142] These regions are defined by their cultural similarities, including common religions, languages, and ethnicities. West Asia, also known as Southwest Asia or the Middle East, has cultural roots in the ancient civilizations of the Fertile Crescent and Mesopotamia, which gave rise to the Persian, Arab, Ottoman empires, as well as the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.[143] These civilizations, which are located in the Hilly flanks, are among the oldest in the world, with evidence of farming dating back to around 9000 BCE.[144] Despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges, trade and commerce have helped to create a Pan-Asian culture that is shared across the region.[145]\n\n\n\n### Nobel prizes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Indian polymath Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, and became Asia's first Nobel laureate.\nThe polymath Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali poet, dramatist, and writer from Santiniketan, now in West Bengal, India, became in 1913 the first Asian Nobel laureate. He won his Nobel Prize in Literature for notable impact his prose works and poetic thought had on English, French, and other national literatures of Europe and the Americas. He is also the writer of the national anthems of Bangladesh and India.\n\n\nOther Asian writers who won Nobel Prize for literature include Yasunari Kawabata (Japan, 1968), Kenzaburō Ōe (Japan, 1994), Gao Xingjian (China, 2000), Orhan Pamuk (Turkey, 2006), and Mo Yan (China, 2012). Some may consider the American writer, Pearl S. Buck, an honorary Asian Nobel laureate, having spent considerable time in China as the daughter of missionaries, and based many of her novels, namely *The Good Earth* (1931) and *The Mother* (1933), as well as the biographies of her parents for their time in China, *The Exile* and *Fighting Angel*, all of which earned her the Literature prize in 1938.\n\n\nAlso, Mother Teresa of India and Shirin Ebadi of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children. Ebadi is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize. Another Nobel Peace Prize winner is Aung San Suu Kyi from Burma for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a military dictatorship in Burma. She is a nonviolent pro-democracy activist and leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma (Myanmar) and a noted prisoner of conscience. She is a Buddhist and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for \"his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China\" on 8 October 2010. He is the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China. In 2014, Kailash Satyarthi from India and Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education\".\n\n\nSir C.V. Raman is the first Asian to get a Nobel prize in Sciences. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him\".\n\n\nJapan has won the most Nobel Prizes of any Asian nation with 24 followed by India which has won 13.\n\n\nAmartya Sen, (born 3 November 1933) is an Indian economist who was awarded the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory, and for his interest in the problems of society's poorest members.\n\n\nOther Asian Nobel Prize winners include Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Abdus Salam, Malala Yousafzai, Robert Aumann, Menachem Begin, Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko, Daniel Kahneman, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, Ada Yonath, Yasser Arafat, José Ramos-Horta and Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo of Timor Leste, Kim Dae-jung, and 13 Japanese scientists. Most of the said awardees are from Japan and Israel except for Chandrasekhar and Raman (India), Abdus Salam and Malala Yousafzai, (Pakistan), Arafat (Palestinian Territories), Kim (South Korea), and Horta and Belo (Timor Leste).\n\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the establishment of Grameen Bank, a community development bank that lends money to poor people, especially women in Bangladesh. Dr. Yunus received his PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University, United States. He is internationally known for the concept of micro credit which allows poor and destitute people with little or no collateral to borrow money. The borrowers typically pay back money within the specified period and the incidence of default is very low.\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama has received approximately eighty-four awards over his spiritual and political career.[146] On 22 June 2006, he became one of only four people ever to be recognized with Honorary Citizenship by the Governor General of Canada. On 28 May 2005, he received the Christmas Humphreys Award from the Buddhist Society in the United Kingdom. Most notable was the Nobel Peace Prize, presented in Oslo, Norway on 10 December 1989.\n\n\n\n## Political geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Asia\n\nSee also: List of sovereign states and

At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of Earth's land area and 6% of its total surface area.[7] With 1.4 billion people[1][2] as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world's human population. Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[8][9] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[10] Despite a wide range of natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of Oceania. Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, climate, tribalism,[11] colonialism, the Cold War,[12][13] neocolonialism, lack of democracy, and corruption.[11] Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.\n\n\nThe continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states, eight cities and islands that are part of non-African states, and two *de facto* independent states with limited or no recognition. This count does not include Malta and Sicily, which are geologically part of the African continent. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.\n\n\nAfrica straddles the equator and the prime meridian. It is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to the southern temperate zones.[14] The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and a number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of Western Sahara, Algeria, Libya and Egypt, the northern tip of Mauritania, and the entire territories of Morocco, Ceuta, Melilla, and Tunisia which in turn are located above the tropic of Cancer, in the northern temperate zone. In the other extreme of the continent, southern Namibia, southern Botswana, great parts of South Africa, the entire territories of Lesotho and Eswatini and the southern tips of Mozambique and Madagascar are located below the tropic of Capricorn, in the southern temperate zone.\n\n\nAfrica is highly biodiverse;[15] it is the continent with the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. However, Africa also is heavily affected by a wide range of environmental issues, including desertification, deforestation, water scarcity and pollution. These entrenched environmental concerns are expected to worsen as climate change impacts Africa. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified Africa as the continent most vulnerable to climate change.[16][17]\n\n\nThe history of Africa is long, complex, and has often been under-appreciated by the global historical community.[18] Africa, particularly Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes). The earliest hominids and their ancestors have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including *Sahelanthropus tchadensis*, *Australopithecus africanus*, *A. afarensis*, *Homo erectus*, *H. habilis* and *H. ergaster*—the earliest *Homo sapiens* (modern human) remains, found in Ethiopia, South Africa, and Morocco, date to circa 233,000, 259,000, and 300,000 years ago, respectively, and *Homo sapiens* is believed to have originated in Africa around 350,000–260,000 years ago.[a] Africa is also considered by anthropologists to be the most genetically diverse continent as a result of being the longest inhabited.[25][26][27]\n\n\nEarly human civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt and Carthage emerged in North Africa. Following a subsequent long and complex history of civilizations, migration and trade, Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. The last 400 years have witnessed an increasing European influence on the continent. Starting in the 16th century, this was driven by trade, including the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, which created large African diaspora populations in the Americas. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, European nations colonized almost all of Africa, reaching a point when only Ethiopia and Liberia were independent polities.[28] Most present states in Africa emerged from a process of decolonisation following World War II.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The totality of Africa seen by the Apollo 17 crew\n*Afri* was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known northern Africa to the west of the Nile river, and in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).[29][30] This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe, an ancestor of modern Berbers; see Terence for discussion. The name had usually been connected with the Phoenician word **ʿafar** meaning \"dust\",[31] but a 1981 hypothesis[32] has asserted that it stems from the Berber word *ifri* (plural *ifran*) meaning \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.[33] The same word[33] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as *Ifrane*) in northwestern Libya,[34] as well as the city of Ifrane in Morocco.\n\n\nUnder Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province it then named *Africa Proconsularis*, following its defeat of the Carthaginians in the Third Punic War in 146 BC, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[35] The Latin suffix *-ica* can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in *Celtica* from *Celtae*, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim region of Ifriqiya, following its conquest of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire's *Exarchatus Africae*, also preserved a form of the name.\n\n\nAccording to the Romans, Africa lies to the west of Egypt, while \"Asia\" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 CE), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of \"Africa\" expanded with their knowledge.\n\n\nOther etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name \"Africa\":\n\n\n\n* The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (*Ant. 1.15*) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.\n* Isidore of Seville in his 7th-century *Etymologiae* XIV.5.2. suggests \"Africa comes from the Latin *aprica*, meaning \"sunny\".\n* Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian *af-rui-ka*, meaning \"to turn toward the opening of the Ka.\" The Ka is the energetic double of every person and the \"opening of the Ka\" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, \"the birthplace.\"[36]\n* Michèle Fruyt in 1976 proposed[37] linking the Latin word with *africus* \"south wind\", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally \"rainy wind\".\n* Robert R. Stieglitz of Rutgers University in 1984 proposed: \"The name Africa, derived from the Latin \\*Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew Ophir ['rich'].\"[38]\n* Ibn Khallikan and some other historians claim that the name of Africa came from a Himyarite king called Afrikin ibn Kais ibn Saifi also called \"Afrikus son of Abraham\" who subdued Ifriqiya.[39][40][41]\n* Arabic *afrīqā* (feminine noun) and *ifrīqiyā*, now usually pronounced *afrīqiyā* (feminine) 'Africa', from *‘afara* [‘ = *‘ain*, not *’alif*] 'to be dusty' from *‘afar* 'dust, powder' and *‘afir* 'dried, dried up by the sun, withered' and *‘affara* 'to dry in the sun on hot sand' or 'to sprinkle with dust'.[42]\n* Possibly Phoenician *faraqa* in the sense of 'colony, separation'.[43]\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Africa\n\nFurther information: History of North Africa, History of West Africa, History of Central Africa, History of East Africa, and History of Southern Africa\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Africa\n\nSee also: Recent African origin of modern humans\n\n![](image)Lucy, an *Australopithecus afarensis* skeleton discovered 24 November 1974 in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia's Afar Depression\nAfrica is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth, with the Human species originating from the continent.[44] During the mid-20th century, anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (Before present, BP). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as *Australopithecus afarensis* radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0 million years BP,[45] *Paranthropus boisei* (c. 2.3–1.4 million years BP)[46] and *Homo ergaster* (c. 1.9 million–600,000 years BP) have been discovered.[7]\n\n\nAfter the evolution of *Homo sapiens* approximately 350,000 to 260,000 years BP in Africa,[20][21][22][23] the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers.[47][48] These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea,[49][50] the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco,[51][52] or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.[53]\n\n\nOther migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the Sahara.[54]\n\n\n\n### Emergence of civilization[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cradle of civilization § Ancient Egypt\n\nThe size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.[55] At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BCE, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub-Saharan Africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia.[56] However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the Earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.[57] The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.\n\n\n\n![](image)Saharan rock art in the Fezzan, Libya\nThe domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.[58] In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia.\n\n\nBetween 10,000 and 9,000 BC, pottery was independently invented in the region of Mali in the savannah of West Africa.[59][60]\n\n\nIn the steppes and savannahs of the Sahara and Sahel in Northern West Africa, people possibly ancestral to modern Nilo-Saharan and Mandé cultures started to collect wild millet,[61] around 8000 to 6000 BCE. Later, gourds, watermelons, castor beans, and cotton were also collected.[62] Sorghum was first domesticated in Eastern Sudan around 4000 BC, in one of the earliest instances of agriculture in human history. Its cultivation would gradually spread across Africa, before spreading to India around 2000 BC.[63][64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Colossal statues of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel, Egypt, date from around 1250 BC.\nPeople around modern-day Mauritania started making pottery and built stone settlements (e.g., Tichitt, Oualata). Fishing, using bone-tipped harpoons, became a major activity in the numerous streams and lakes formed from the increased rains.[65] In West Africa, the wet phase ushered in an expanding rainforest and wooded savanna from Senegal to Cameroon. Between 9,000 and 5,000 BC, Niger–Congo speakers domesticated the oil palm and raffia palm. Black-eyed peas and voandzeia (African groundnuts), were domesticated, followed by okra and kola nuts. Since most of the plants grew in the forest, the Niger–Congo speakers invented polished stone axes for clearing forest.[66]\n\n\nAround 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.[67] This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and encouraged migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.[67] During the first millennium BC, a reduction in wild grain populations related to changing climate conditions facilitated the expansion of farming communities and the rapid adoption of rice cultivation around the Niger River.[68][69]\n\n\nBy the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa. Around that time it also became established in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, either through independent invention there or diffusion from the north[70][71] and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, having lasted approximately 2,000 years,[72] and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions did not begin ironworking until the early centuries CE. Copper objects from Egypt, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.[67]\n\n\n\n### Early civilizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ancient Africa\n\n\n![](image)Diachronic map showing African empires spanning roughly 500 BC to 1500 AD\nAt about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilization of ancient Egypt.[73] One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC.[74][75] Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.[76]\n\n\nAn independent centre of civilization with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north-west African coast at Carthage.[77][78][79]\n\n\nEuropean exploration of Africa began with the ancient Greeks and Romans.[80][81] In 332 BC, Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian-occupied Egypt. He founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death.[82]\n\n\n\n![](image)Roman ruins of Timgad, in modern-day Algeria\n![](image)Ruins of the Punic district of Carthage\n![](image)Nubian pyramids at Meroë, Sudan\nFollowing the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first Roman emperor native to North Africa was Septimius Severus, born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libya – his mother was Italian Roman and his father was Punic.[83]\n\n\nChristianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia;[84] by 340 AD at the latest, it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire. Syro-Greek missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.[85]\n\n\nIn the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.[86]\n\n\nIn West Africa, Dhar Tichitt and Oualata in present-day Mauritania figure prominently among the early urban centers, dated to 2,000 BC. About 500 stone settlements litter the region in the former savannah of the Sahara. Its inhabitants fished and grew millet. It has been found by Augustin Holl that the Soninke of the Mandé peoples were likely responsible for constructing such settlements. Around 300 BCE, the region became more desiccated and the settlements began to decline, most likely relocating to Koumbi Saleh.[87] Architectural evidence and the comparison of pottery styles suggest that Dhar Tichitt was related to the subsequent Ghana Empire. Djenné-Djenno (in present-day Mali) was settled around 300 BC, and the town grew to house a sizable Iron Age population, as evidenced by crowded cemeteries. Living structures were made of sun-dried mud. By 250 BCE, Djenné-Djenno had become a large, thriving market town.[88][89]\n\n\nFurther south, in central Nigeria, around 1,500 BC, the Nok culture developed on the Jos Plateau. It was a highly centralized community. The Nok people produced lifelike representations in terracotta, including human heads and human figures, elephants, and other animals. By 500 BC, and possibly earlier, they were smelting iron. By 200 AD, the Nok culture had vanished.[71] and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, having lasted approximately 2,000 years. Based on stylistic similarities with the Nok terracottas, the bronze figurines of the Yoruba kingdom of Ife and those of the Bini kingdom of Benin are suggested to be continuations of the traditions of the earlier Nok culture.[90][72]\n\n\n\n\n### Ninth to eighteenth centuries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medieval and early modern Africa\n\n![](image)The intricate 9th-century bronzes from Igbo-Ukwu, in Nigeria displayed a level of technical accomplishment that was notably more advanced than European bronze casting of the same period.[91]\nPre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities[92] characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu-speaking peoples of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa; the large Sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan; Edo, Yoruba, and Igbo people in West Africa; and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa.\n\n\nBy the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.\n\n\nIn the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu. The bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century.[93]\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Ife, historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly oba ('king' or 'ruler' in the Yoruba language), called the *Ooni of Ife*. Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire, where its obas or kings, called the *Alaafins of Oyo*, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the Fon *Kingdom of Dahomey* was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruins of Great Zimbabwe (flourished eleventh to fifteenth centuries)\nThe Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.[94] The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized,[95] and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.[96]\n\n\nFollowing the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.[97] By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.\n\n\n\n### Height of the slave trade[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Trans-Saharan slave trade, Atlantic slave trade, and Indian Ocean slave trade\n\n![](image)Major slave trading regions of Africa, 15th–19th centuries.\nSlavery had long been practiced in Africa.[98][99] Between the 15th and the 19th centuries, the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the New World.[100][101][102] In addition, more than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.[103]\n\n\nIn West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.[104]\n\n\nAction was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against \"the usurping King of Lagos\", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.[105] The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of \"legitimate commerce\" in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.[106]\n\n\n\n### Colonialism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial Africa\n\n![](image)Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from Scramble for Africa.[edit]\nThe Scramble for Africa[b] was the conquest and colonisation of most of Africa by seven Western European powers driven by the Second Industrial Revolution during the era of \"New Imperialism\" (1833–1914). In 1870, 10% of the continent was formally under European control. By 1914, this figure had risen to almost 90%, with only Liberia, Ethiopia, and parts of present-day Libya retaining their full sovereignty.[c]\n\n\nThe 1884 Berlin Conference regulated European colonisation and trade in Africa, and is seen as emblematic of the \"scramble\".[108] In the last quarter of the 19th century, there were considerable political rivalries between the European empires, which provided the impetus for the colonisation.[109] The later years of the 19th century saw a transition from \"informal imperialism\" – military influence and economic dominance – to direct rule.[110]\n\n\n\nWith the decline of the European colonial empires in the wake of the two world wars, most African colonies gained independence during the Cold War, and decided to keep their colonial borders in the Organisation of African Unity conference of 1964 due to fears of civil wars and regional instability, placing emphasis on pan-Africanism.[111]\n\n### Independence struggles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)European control in 1939 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Belgian\n | Italian\n |\n| British\n | Portuguese\n |\n| French\n | Spanish\n |\n| Independent\n |  |\n\n\nImperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France.[112] Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957),[113] becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.\n\n\nPortugal's overseas presence in sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.\n\n\n\n### Post-colonial Africa[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Postcolonial Africa\n\nSee also: Decolonisation of Africa, Neocolonialism, CFA franc, Status of forces agreement, and Non-Aligned Movement\n\nToday, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since independence, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis – per the criteria laid out by Lührmann et al. (2018), only Botswana and Mauritius have been consistently democratic for the entirety of their post-colonial history. Most African countries have experienced several coups or periods of military dictatorship. Between 1990 and 2018, though, the continent as a whole has trended towards more democratic governance.[114]\n\n\nUpon independence an overwhelming majority of Africans lived in extreme poverty. The continent suffered from the lack of infrastructural or industrial development under colonial rule, along with political instability. With limited financial resources or access to global markets, relatively stable countries such as Kenya still experienced only very slow economic development. Only a handful of African countries succeeded in obtaining rapid economic growth prior to 1990. Exceptions include Libya and Equatorial Guinea, both of which possess large oil reserves.\n\n\nInstability throughout the continent after decolonization resulted primarily from marginalization of ethnic groups, and corruption. In pursuit of personal political gain, many leaders deliberately promoted ethnic conflicts, some of which had originated during the colonial period, such as from the grouping of multiple unrelated ethnic groups into a single colony, the splitting of a distinct ethnic group between multiple colonies, or existing conflicts being exacerbated by colonial rule (for instance, the preferential treatment given to ethnic Hutus over Tutsis in Rwanda during German and Belgian rule).\n\n\nFaced with increasingly frequent and severe violence, military rule was widely accepted by the population of many countries as means to maintain order, and during the 1970s and 1980s a majority of African countries were controlled by military dictatorships. Territorial disputes between nations and rebellions by groups seeking independence were also common in independent African states. The most devastating of these was the Nigerian Civil War, fought between government forces and an Igbo separatist republic, which resulted in a famine that killed 1–2 million people. Two civil wars in Sudan, the first lasting from 1955 to 1972 and the second from 1983 to 2005, collectively killed around 3 million. Both were fought primarily on ethnic and religious lines.\n\n\nCold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union also contributed to instability. Both the Soviet Union and the United States offered considerable incentives to African political and military leaders who aligned themselves with the superpowers' foreign policy. As an example, during the Angolan Civil War, the Soviet and Cuban aligned MPLA and the American aligned UNITA received the vast majority of their military and political support from these countries. Many African countries became highly dependent on foreign aid. The sudden loss of both Soviet and American aid at the end of the Cold War and fall of the USSR resulted in severe economic and political turmoil in the countries most dependent on foreign support.\n\n\nThere was a major famine in Ethiopia between 1983 and 1985, killing up to 1.2 million people, which most historians attribute primarily to the forced relocation of farmworkers and seizure of grain by communist Derg government, further exacerbated by the civil war.[115][116][117][118] In 1994 a genocide in Rwanda resulted in up to 800,000 deaths, added to a severe refugee crisis and fueled the rise of militia groups in neighboring countries. This contributed to the outbreak of the first and second Congo Wars, which were the most devastating military conflicts in modern Africa, with up to 5.5 million deaths,[119] making it by far the deadliest conflict in modern African history and one of the costliest wars in human history.[120]\n\n\n\n* ![An animated map shows the order of independence of African nations, 1950–2011](image)\n\nAn animated map shows the order of independence of African nations, 1950–2011\n* ![Africa's wars and conflicts, 1980–96   Major Wars/Conflict (>100,000 casualties)   Minor Wars/Conflict   Other Conflicts](image)\n\nAfrica's wars and conflicts, 1980–96  \nMajor Wars/Conflict (>100,000 casualties)\nMinor Wars/Conflict\nOther Conflicts\n* ![Political map of Africa in 2021](image)\n\nPolitical map of Africa in 2021\n\n\nVarious conflicts between various insurgent groups and governments continue. Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur (Sudan) which peaked in intensity from 2003 to 2005 with notable spikes in violence in 2007 and 2013–15, killing around 300,000 people total. The Boko Haram Insurgency primarily within Nigeria (with considerable fighting in Niger, Chad, and Cameroon as well) has killed around 350,000 people since 2009. Most African conflicts have been reduced to low-intensity conflicts as of 2022. However, the Tigray War which began in 2020 has killed an estimated 300,000–500,000 people, primarily due to famine.\n\n\nOverall though, violence across Africa has greatly declined in the 21st century, with the end of civil wars in Angola, Sierra Leone, and Algeria in 2002, Liberia in 2003, and Sudan and Burundi in 2005. The Second Congo War, which involved 9 countries and several insurgent groups, ended in 2003. This decline in violence coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms, which over the course of the 1990s and 2000s promoted the establishment of permanent, peaceful trade between neighboring countries (see Capitalist peace).\n\n\nImproved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China,[121] which further spurred economic growth. Between 2000 and 2014, annual GDP growth in sub-Saharan Africa averaged 5.02%, doubling its total GDP from $811 Billion to $1.63 Trillion (Constant 2015 USD).[122] North Africa experienced comparable growth rates.[123] A significant part of this growth can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.[124] While several individual countries have maintained high growth rates, since 2014 overall growth has considerably slowed, primarily as a result of falling commodity prices, continued lack of industrialization, and epidemics of Ebola and COVID-19.[125][126]\n\n\n\n## Geology, geography, ecology, and environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Africa\n\n![](image)Topography of Africa\nAfrica is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the Earth. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (transected by the Suez Canal), 163 km (101 mi) wide.[127] (Geopolitically, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa, as well.)[128]\n\n\nThe coastline is 26,000 km (16,000 mi) long, and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that Europe, which covers only 10,400,000 km2 (4,000,000 sq mi) – about a third of the surface of Africa – has a coastline of 32,000 km (20,000 mi).[129] From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka in Tunisia (37°21' N), to the most southerly point, Cape Agulhas in South Africa (34°51'15\" S), is a distance of approximately 8,000 km (5,000 mi).[130] Cape Verde, 17°33'22\" W, the westernmost point, is a distance of approximately 7,400 km (4,600 mi) to Ras Hafun, 51°27'52\" E, the most easterly projection that neighbours Cape Guardafui, the tip of the Horn of Africa.[129]\n\n\nAfrica's largest country is Algeria, and its smallest country is Seychelles, an archipelago off the east coast.[131] The smallest nation on the continental mainland is The Gambia.\n\n\n\n### African plate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Today, the African Plate is moving over Earth's surface at a speed of 0.292° ± 0.007° per million years, relative to the \"average\" Earth (NNR-MORVEL56)\nThis section is an excerpt from African Plate.[edit]\nThe African Plate, also known as the Nubian Plate, is a major tectonic plate that includes much of the continent of Africa (except for its easternmost part) and the adjacent oceanic crust to the west and south. It is bounded by the North American Plate and South American Plate to the west (separated by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge); the Arabian Plate and Somali Plate to the east; the Eurasian Plate, Aegean Sea Plate and Anatolian Plate to the north; and the Antarctic Plate to the south.\n\n\n\nBetween 60 million years ago and 10 million years ago, the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift.[132] Since the continent of Africa consists of crust from both the African and the Somali plates, some literature refers to the African Plate as the *Nubian Plate* to distinguish it from the continent as a whole.[133]\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Africa\n\nThe climate of Africa ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily desert, or arid, while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and dense jungle (rainforest) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on Earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.[134] The record for the highest-ever recorded temperature, in Libya in 1922 (58 °C (136 °F)), was discredited in 2013.[135][136]\n\n\n\n### Ecology and biodiversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The main biomes in Africa.\nAfrica has over 3,000 protected areas, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and arable land. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.[134]\n\n\nDeforestation is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).[137] According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world.[134] Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West Africa have been destroyed.[138] Over 90% of Madagascar's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago.[139] About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.[140]\n\n\n\nSee also: Afrotropical realm and Palearctic realm\n\n### Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Environmental issues in Africa.[edit]\nAfrican environmental issues are caused by human impacts on the natural environment and affect humans and nearly all forms of life. Issues include deforestation, soil degradation, air pollution, water pollution, garbage pollution, climate change and water scarcity (resulting in problems with access to safe water supply and sanitation).[141] These issues result in environmental conflict and are connected to broader social struggles for democracy and sovereignty.[142]\n\n### Water resources[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water scarcity in Africa and Water supply and sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa\n\nWater development and management are complex in Africa due to the multiplicity of trans-boundary water resources (rivers, lakes and aquifers).[143] Around 75% of sub-Saharan Africa falls within 53 international river basin catchments that traverse multiple borders.[144][143] This particular constraint can also be converted into an opportunity if the potential for trans-boundary cooperation is harnessed in the development of the area's water resources.[143] A multi-sectoral analysis of the Zambezi River, for example, shows that riparian cooperation could lead to a 23% increase in firm energy production without any additional investments.[144][143] A number of institutional and legal frameworks for transboundary cooperation exist, such as the Zambezi River Authority, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol, Volta River Authority and the Nile Basin Commission.[143] However, additional efforts are required to further develop political will, as well as the financial capacities and institutional frameworks needed for win-win multilateral cooperative actions and optimal solutions for all riparians.[143]\n\n![](image)Africa Water Precipitation\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate-smart agriculture and rainwater harvesting in Machakos County, Kenya.\nThis section is an excerpt from Climate change in Africa.[edit]\nClimate change in Africa is an increasingly serious threat as Africa is among the most vulnerable continents to the effects of climate change.[145][146][147] Some sources even classify Africa as \"the most vulnerable continent on Earth\".[148][149] Climate change and climate variability will likely reduce agricultural production, food security and water security.[150] As a result, there will be negative consequences on people's lives and sustainable development in Africa.[146]\n\n\n\nOver the coming decades, warming from climate change is expected across almost all the Earth's surface, and global mean rainfall will increase.[151] Currently, Africa is warming faster than the rest of the world on average. Large portions of the continent may become uninhabitable as a result of the rapid effects of climate change, which would have disastrous effects on human health, food security, and poverty.[152][153][154] Regional effects on rainfall in the tropics are expected to be much more spatially variable. The direction of change at any one location is often less certain.\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fauna of Africa\n\n![](image)Savanna at Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania\nAfrica boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and \"range of freedom\" of wild animal populations and diversity, with wild populations of large carnivores (such as lions, hyenas, and cheetahs) and herbivores (such as buffalo, elephants, camels, and giraffes) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of \"jungle\" animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians. In addition, Africa has the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna.\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of political parties in Africa by country\n\n### African Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: African Union\n\n![](image)Regions of the African Union:  \n  **Northern Region** ,  **Southern Region** ,  **Eastern Region** ,  **Western Regions A and B** ,  **Central Region** \nThe African Union (AU) is a continental union consisting of 55 member states. The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002[155] as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa.\n\n\nThe African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union, regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.\n\n\nExtensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Ivory Coast.\n\n\n\n### Boundary conflicts[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: The Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 and List of conflicts in Africa\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Military history of Africa § Post-colonial.[edit]\nAfrican nations have made great efforts to respect international borders as inviolate for a long time. For example, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which was established in 1963 and replaced by the African Union in 2002, set the respect for the territorial integrity of each country as one of its principles in OAU Charter.[156] Indeed, compared with the formation of European countries, there have been fewer international conflicts in Africa for changing the borders, which has influenced country formation there and has enabled some countries to survive that might have been defeated and absorbed by others.[157] Yet international conflicts have played out by support for proxy armies or rebel movements. Many states have experienced civil wars: including Rwanda, Sudan, Angola, Sierra Leone, Congo, Liberia, Ethiopia and Somalia.[158]\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Africa, List of African countries by GDP (nominal), and List of African countries by GDP (PPP)\n\nSee also: Economy of the African Union\n\n![](image)Map of the African Economic Community. CEN-SAD\n COMESA\n EAC\n ECCAS\n ECOWAS\n IGAD\n SADC\n UMA\n\nAlthough it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's poorest and least-developed continent (other than Antarctica), the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, low self-esteem, lack of access to foreign capital, legacies of colonialism, the slave trade, and the Cold War, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide).[159] Its total nominal GDP remains behind that of the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, India and France. According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.[160]\n\n\nPoverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the World Bank[161] announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). Eighty-one percent of the sub-Saharan African population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 86% for India.[162]\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,[163] indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.[164][165]\n\n\nAfrica is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries. The last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme (HIPC). The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in Africa. About ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in sub-Saharan Africa was resolved, Zambia fell back into debt. A small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in 2011, but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite.[166]\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity.\n\n\nIn a recently published analysis based on World Values Survey data, the Austrian political scientist Arno Tausch maintained that several African countries, most notably Ghana, perform quite well on scales of mass support for democracy and the market economy.[167]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (nominal, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| — | *![](image) African Union* | 2,945,709 | 2022\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Nigeria | 568,499 | 2014\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Egypt | 476,748 | 2022\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) South Africa | 458,708 | 2011\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Algeria | 224,107 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Ethiopia | 155,804 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Morocco | 147,343 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Angola | 145,712 | 2014\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Kenya | 113,701 | 2022\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Libya[168] | 92,542 | 2012\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Tanzania | 84,033 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (PPP, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| — | *![](image) African Union* | 8,865,179 | 2023\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Egypt | 1,809,425 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Nigeria | 1,365,903 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) South Africa | 997,444 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Algeria | 628,990 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Ethiopia | 393,297 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Morocco | 385,337 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Kenya | 338,964 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Angola | 260,323 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Tanzania | 227,725 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Ghana | 227,189 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\nTausch's global value comparison based on the World Values Survey derived the following factor analytical scales: 1. The non-violent and law-abiding society 2. Democracy movement 3. Climate of personal non-violence 4. Trust in institutions 5. Happiness, good health 6. No redistributive religious fundamentalism 7. Accepting the market 8. Feminism 9. Involvement in politics 10. Optimism and engagement 11. No welfare mentality, acceptancy of the Calvinist work ethics. The spread in the performance of African countries with complete data, Tausch concluded \"is really amazing\". While one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in Ghana, the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for Egypt and Algeria, and especially for Africa's leading economy, South Africa. High Human Inequality, as measured by the UNDP's Human Development Report's Index of Human Inequality, further impairs the development of human security. Tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism, corresponding to economic and human rights data, emerging from Africa, is reflected in the development of a civil society.\n\n\n\n![](image)African countries by GDP (PPP) per capita in 2020\nThe continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite,[169] 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium.[170] The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves.[171] Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.[172] As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis pushed 100 million people into food insecurity.[173]\n\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.[121]\n\n\nA Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. \"African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.\"[174]\n\n\n\n### Electricity generation[edit]\n\n\nThe main source of electricity is hydropower, which contributes significantly to the current installed capacity for energy.[143] The Kainji Dam is a typical hydropower resource generating electricity for all the large cities in Nigeria as well as their neighbouring country, Niger.[175] Hence, the continuous investment in the last decade, which has increased the amount of power generated.[143]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Africa, Genetic history of Africa, and Child marriage in Africa\n\nSee also: List of African countries by population and List of African countries by life expectancy\n\nProportion of total African population by country\n\n\n\nNigeria (15.38%)\nEthiopia (8.37%)\nEgypt (7.65%)\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (6.57%)\nTanzania (4.55%)\nSouth Africa (4.47%)\nKenya (3.88%)\nUganda (3.38%)\nAlgeria (3.36%)\nOther (42.39%)\n\nAfrica's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and is consequently relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.[176] The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.[177] As of 2021, the population of Africa is estimated at 1.4 billion [1][2]. Africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time – India and China's 1.4 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022.[178] This increase in number of babies born in Africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 37% in the year 2050; while in 1990 sub-Saharan Africa accounted for only 16% of the world's births.[179]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate (children per woman) for Sub-Saharan Africa is 4.7 as of 2018, the highest in the world.[180] All countries in sub-Saharan Africa had TFRs (average number of children) above replacement level in 2019 and accounted for 27.1% of global livebirths.[181] In 2021, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 29% of global births.[182]\n\n\nSpeakers of Bantu languages (part of the Niger–Congo family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from the Sahel progressively expanded over most of sub-Saharan Africa.[183] But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (\"San\" or \"Bushmen\") and Pygmy peoples in Southern and Central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also \"San\", closely related to, but distinct from \"Hottentots\") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa.[*citation needed*] Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.[184]\n\n\nThe peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger–Congo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan, and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Map of Africa indicating Human Development Index (2018).  |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0.800–0.849\n 0.750–0.799\n 0.700–0.749\n 0.650–0.699\n 0.600–0.649\n 0.550–0.599\n | 0.500–0.549\n 0.450–0.499\n 0.400–0.449\n ≤ 0.399\n No data\n |\n |\n\n\nThe peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century CE introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.[185] The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.[186]\n\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.\n\n\nPrior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[187] Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million *pieds-noirs* in North Africa),[188] Kenya, Congo,[189] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[190] Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone.[191] Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Réunion, and South Africa.[192] The country with the largest white African population is South Africa.[193] Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.[194]\n\n\nEuropean colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese[121] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.[195]\n\n\n\n### Alternative Estimates of African Population, 0–2018 AD (in thousands)[edit]\n\n\nSource: Maddison and others.

However, in formal surveys or census, most people will identify with major religions that came from outside the continent, mainly through colonisation. There are several reasons for this, the main one being the colonial idea that African religious beliefs and practices are not good enough. Religious beliefs and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive topic for governments with mixed religious populations.[201][202] According to the *World Book Encyclopedia*, Islam and Christianity are the two largest religions in Africa. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow traditional religions.[*citation needed*] A small number of Africans are Hindu, Buddhist, Confucianist, Baháʼí, or Jewish. There is also a minority of people in Africa who are irreligious.\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Africa\n\nSee also: Writing systems of Africa § Indigenous writing systems\n\nBy most estimates, well over a thousand languages (UNESCO has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.[203] Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well.[*further explanation needed*] There are four major groups indigenous to Africa:\n\n\n\n![](image)A simplistic view of language families spoken in Africa\n* The *Afroasiatic* languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the Horn of Africa, North Africa, the Sahel, and Southwest Asia.\n* The *Nilo-Saharan* languages consist of a group of several possibly related families,[204] spoken by 30 million people between 100 languages. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, and northern Tanzania.\n* The *Niger-Congo* language family covers much of sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of number of languages, it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps one of the largest in the world.\n* The *Khoisan* languages form a group of three unrelated[205] families and two isolates and number about fifty in total. They are mainly spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 400,000 people.[206] Many of the Khoisan languages are endangered. The Khoi and San peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.\n\n\nFollowing the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (*see African French*) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate. In total, at least a fifth of Africans speak the former colonial languages.[207][208][209][d]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa, total (% of population ages 15–49), in 2011 (World Bank) \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| over 15%\n 5–15%\n 2–5%\n 1–2%\n 0.5-1%\n 0.1–0.5%\n not available\n |\n\n\nMore than 85% of individuals in Africa use traditional medicine as an alternative to often expensive allopathic medical health care and costly pharmaceutical products. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) Heads of State and Government declared the 2000s decade as the African Decade on African traditional medicine in an effort to promote The WHO African Region's adopted resolution for institutionalizing traditional medicine in health care systems across the continent.[210] Public policy makers in the region are challenged with consideration of the importance of traditional/indigenous health systems and whether their coexistence with the modern medical and health sub-sector would improve the equitability and accessibility of health care distribution, the health status of populations, and the social-economic development of nations within sub-Saharan Africa.[211]\n\n\nAIDS in post-colonial Africa is a prevalent issue. Although the continent is home to about 15.2 percent of the world's population,[212] more than two-thirds of the total infected worldwide – some 35 million people – were Africans, of whom 15 million have already died.[213] Sub-Saharan Africa alone accounted for an estimated 69 percent of all people living with HIV[214] and 70 percent of all AIDS deaths in 2011.[215] In the countries of sub-Saharan Africa most affected, AIDS has raised death rates and lowered life expectancy among adults between the ages of 20 and 49 by about twenty years.[213] Furthermore, the life expectancy in many parts of Africa has declined, largely as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic with life-expectancy in some countries reaching as low as thirty-four years.[216]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Africa\n\n![](image)The Senegambian stone circles, lying in The Gambia and Senegal, are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nSome aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.[217] Leopold II of Belgium attempted to \"civilize\" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.[217]\n\n\nObidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.[218] According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, \"The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art.\"[219] Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects \"lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.[219] Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that \"the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art.\"[220] Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the \"traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe.\"[221] On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)assert themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies.\"[222]\n\n\nThere is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.\n\n\nAs of March 2023, 98 African properties are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. Among these proprieties, 54 are cultural sites, 39 are natural sites and 5 are mixed sites. The List Of World Heritage in Danger includes 15 African sites.[223]\n\n\n\n### Visual art[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nok figure (5th century BCE-5th century CE)\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from African art.[edit]\nAfrican art describes the modern and historical paintings, sculptures, installations, and other visual culture from native or indigenous Africans and the African continent. The definition may also include the art of the African diasporas, such as: African-American, Caribbean or art in South American societies inspired by African traditions. Despite this diversity, there are unifying artistic themes present when considering the totality of the visual culture from the continent of Africa.[224]\n\n\nPottery, metalwork, sculpture, architecture, textile art and fiber art are important visual art forms across Africa and may be included in the study of African art. The term \"African art\" does not usually include the art of the North African areas along the Mediterranean coast, as such areas had long been part of different traditions. For more than a millennium, the art of such areas had formed part of Berber or Islamic art, although with many particular local characteristics.\n\n\nThe Art of Ethiopia, with a long Christian tradition,[225] is also different from that of most of Africa, where the Traditional African religion (with Islam in the north) was dominant until the 20th century.[226] African art includes prehistoric and ancient art, the Islamic art of West Africa, the Christian art of East Africa, and the traditional artifacts of these and other regions. Many African sculptures were historically made of wood and other natural materials that have not survived from earlier than a few centuries ago, although rare older pottery and metal figures can be found in some areas.[227] Some of the earliest decorative objects, such as shell beads and evidence of paint, have been discovered in Africa, dating to the Middle Stone Age.[228][229][230] Masks are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, and are often highly Stylized. There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin and depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among \"groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the Niger and Congo rivers\" in West Africa.[231] Direct images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for ritual ceremonies. Since the late 19th century there has been an increasing amount of African art in Western collections, the finest pieces of which are displayed as part of the history of colonization.\n\n\nAfrican art has had an important influence on European Modernist art,[232] which was inspired by their interest in abstract depiction. It was this appreciation of African sculpture that has been attributed to the very concept of \"African art\", as seen by European and American artists and art historians.[233]\n\n\n\nWest African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs, like the famous Benin Bronzes, to decorate palaces and for highly naturalistic royal heads from around the Bini town of Benin City, Edo State, as well as in terracotta or metal, from the 12th–14th centuries. Akan gold weights are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400–1900; some represent proverbs, contributing a narrative element rare in African sculpture; and royal regalia included gold sculptured elements.[234] Many West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings. The Mande-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces from wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs shaped like cylinders. In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Architecture of Africa.[edit]\n![](image)The Great Pyramids of Giza are regarded as one of the greatest architectural feats of all time and are one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World\nLike other aspects of the culture of Africa, the architecture of Africa is exceptionally diverse. Throughout the history of Africa, Africans have developed their own local architectural traditions. In some cases, broader regional styles can be identified, such as the Sudano-Sahelian architecture of West Africa. A common theme in traditional African architecture is the use of fractal scaling: small parts of the structure tend to look similar to larger parts, such as a circular village made of circular houses.[235]\n\n\nAfrican architecture in some areas has been influenced by external cultures for centuries, according to available evidence. Western architecture has influenced coastal areas since the late 15th century and is now an important source of inspiration for many larger buildings, particularly in major cities.\n\n\n\nAfrican architecture uses a wide range of materials, including thatch, stick/wood, mud, mudbrick, rammed earth, and stone. These material preferences vary by region: North Africa for stone and rammed earth, the Horn of Africa for stone and mortar, West Africa for mud/adobe, Central Africa for thatch/wood and more perishable materials, Southeast and Southern Africa for stone and thatch/wood.\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Cinema of Africa.[edit]\n![](image)Cinematic street poster in Tunis, Tunisia for the Egyptian film *Saladin the Victorious* (1963, Arabic: الناصر صلاح الدين, Al Nasser Salah Ad-Din) directed by Youssef Chahine starring Ahmed Mazhar as Saladin, Salah Zulfikar, Nadia Lutfi and others.\nCinema of Africa covers both the history and present of the making or screening of films on the African continent, and also refers to the persons involved in this form of audiovisual culture. It dates back to the early 20th century, when film reels were the primary cinematic technology in use. As there are more than 50 countries with audiovisual traditions, there is no one single 'African cinema'. Both historically and culturally, there are major regional differences between North African and sub-Saharan cinemas, and between the cinemas of different countries.[236]\n\n\n\nThe Cinema of Egypt and the Cinema of Tunisia are among the oldest in the world. Cinema of Egypt in particular is the most established and flourishing industry in Africa.[237][238] Pioneers Auguste and Louis Lumière screened their films in Alexandria, Cairo, Tunis, Susa, Libya and Hammam-Lif, Tunisia in 1896.[239][240] Albert Samama Chikly is often cited as the first producer of indigenous African cinema, screening his own short documentaries in the casino of Tunis as early as December 1905.[241] Alongside his daughter Haydée Tamzali, Chikly would go on to produce important early milestones such as 1924's *The Girl from Carthage*. In 1927, Egypt produced *Laila* the first feature-length film by Aziza Amir. In 1935, the Studio Misr in Cairo began producing mostly formulaic comedies and musicals, but also films like Kamal Selim's *The Will* (1939). Egyptian cinema flourished in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, considered its Golden Age.[242] Youssef Chahine's seminal *Cairo Station* (1958) laid the foundation for Arab film.[243]\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Music of Africa.[edit]\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **may require copy editing for grammar, style, cohesion, tone, or spelling**. You can assist by editing it. *(April 2024)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nGiven the vastness of the African continent, its music is diverse, with regions and nations having many distinct musical traditions. African music includes the genres makwaya, highlife, mbube, township music, jùjú, fuji, jaiva, afrobeat, afrofusion, mbalax, Congolese rumba, soukous, ndombolo, makossa, kizomba, taarab and others.[244] African music also uses a large variety of instruments from all across the continent. The music and dance of the African diaspora, formed to varying degrees on African musical traditions, include American music like Dixieland jazz, blues, jazz, and many Caribbean genres, such as calypso (see kaiso) and soca. Latin American music genres such as cumbia, salsa music, son cubano, rumba, conga, bomba, samba and zouk were founded on the music of enslaved Africans, and have in turn influenced African popular music.[244][245]\n\n\n\nLike the music of Asia, India and the Middle East, it is a highly rhythmic music. The complex rhythmic patterns often involving one rhythm played against another to create a polyrhythm. The most common polyrhythm plays three beats on top of two, like a triplet played against straight notes. Sub-Saharan African music traditions frequently rely on percussion instruments of many varieties, including xylophones, djembes, drums, and tone-producing instruments such as the mbira or \"thumb piano.\"[245][246]\n\n### Dance[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from African dance.[edit]\nAfrican dance (also Afro dance, Afrodance and Afro-dance)[247][248][249][250][251] refers to the various dance styles of sub-Saharan Africa. These dances are closely connected with the traditional rhythms and music traditions of the region. Music and dancing is an integral part of many traditional African societies. Songs and dances facilitate teaching and promoting social values, celebrating special events and major life milestones, performing oral history and other recitations, and spiritual experiences.[252] African dance uses the concepts of polyrhythm and total body articulation.[253] African dances are a collective activity performed in large groups, with significant interaction between dancers and onlookers in the majority of styles.[254]\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Best results of African men's national football teams at the FIFA World Cup\n![Crowd_in_Cairo_Stadium](image)Crowd in Cairo Stadium, Egypt has won the Africa Cup of Nations for seven times [255]\nFifty-four African countries have football teams in the Confederation of African Football. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Morocco, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. Morocco made history at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as the first African nation to reach the semi-finals of the FIFA Men's World Cup. South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament, becoming the first African country to do so. The top clubs in each African football league play the CAF Champions League, while lower-ranked clubs compete in CAF Confederation Cup.\n\n\nIn recent years, the continent has made major progress in terms of state-of-the-art basketball facilities which have been built in cites as diverse as Cairo, Dakar, Johannesburg, Kigali, Luanda and Rades.[256] The number of African basketball players who drafted into the NBA has experienced major growth in the 2010s.[257]\n\n\nCricket is popular in some African nations. South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. Morocco in northern Africa has also hosted the 2002 Morocco Cup, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament.\n\n\nRugby is popular in several southern African nations. Namibia and Zimbabwe both have appeared on multiple occasions at the Rugby World Cup, while South Africa is the joint-most successful national team (alongside New Zealand) at the Rugby World Cup, having won the tournament on 3 occasions, in 1995, 2007, and 2019.[258]\n\n\n\n## Territories and regions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of regions of Africa and List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa\n\n![](image)\nAlgeria\n\nTogo\n\nBenin\n\nBotswana\n\nCameroon\n\nCent Afr Rep\n\nChad\n\nDemocratic  \nRepublic of  \nthe Congo\n\nDjibouti\n\nEgypt\n\nEquatorial Guinea\n\nEritrea\n\nEthiopia\n\nCape\\*  \nVerde\nLibya\n\nMali\n\nGhana\n\nSierra  \nLeone\n\nIvory  \nCoast\n\nBurkina  \nFaso\n\nMauritania\n\nMorocco\n\nSão Tomé  \nand Príncipe\\*\n\nGabon\n\nNamibia\n\nNiger\n\nNigeria\nCongo\n\nSomalia\n\nSomaliland\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSudan\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nTunisia\n\nWestern  \nSahara\n\nSenegal\n\nThe Gambia\n\nGuinea-  \nBissau\n\nGuinea\n\nKenya\n\nLiberia\nMadagascar\n\nMalawi\n\nMozambique\n\nBurundi\n\nRwanda\n\nUganda\n\nTanzania\n\nAngola\n\nSaint Helena (UK)\\*\n\nLesotho\n\nEswatini\n\nZambia\n\nZimbabwe\nMauritius\\*\n\nRéunion\\*\n\n\\*Comoros\n\nSeychelles\n\nAtlantic  \nOcean\n\nAtlantic  \nOcean\n\nIndian  \nOcean\n\nStrait of Gibraltar\n\nMediterranean Sea\n\nRed  \n  Sea\n\nThe countries in this table are categorized according to the scheme for geographic subregions used by the United Nations, and data included are per sources in cross-referenced articles.

The name is still extant today as *Ifira* and *Ifri-n-Dellal* in Greater Kabylia (Algeria). A Berber tribe was called *Beni-Ifren* in the Middle Ages and *Ifurace* was the name of a Tripolitan people in the 6th century. The name is from the Berber language *ifri* 'cave'. Troglodytism was frequent in northern Africa and still occurs today in southern Tunisia. Herodote wrote that the Garamantes, a North African people, used to live in caves. The Ancient Greek called *troglodytēs* an African people who lived in caves. *Africa* was coined by the Romans and '*Ifriqiyeh*' is the arabized Latin name.

At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of Earth's land area and 6% of its total surface area.[7] With 1.4 billion people[1][2] as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world's human population. Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[8][9] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[10] Despite a wide range of natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of Oceania. Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, climate, tribalism,[11] colonialism, the Cold War,[12][13] neocolonialism, lack of democracy, and corruption.[11] Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.\n\n\nThe continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states, eight cities and islands that are part of non-African states, and two *de facto* independent states with limited or no recognition. This count does not include Malta and Sicily, which are geologically part of the African continent. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.\n\n\nAfrica straddles the equator and the prime meridian. It is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to the southern temperate zones.[14] The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and a number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of Western Sahara, Algeria, Libya and Egypt, the northern tip of Mauritania, and the entire territories of Morocco, Ceuta, Melilla, and Tunisia which in turn are located above the tropic of Cancer, in the northern temperate zone. In the other extreme of the continent, southern Namibia, southern Botswana, great parts of South Africa, the entire territories of Lesotho and Eswatini and the southern tips of Mozambique and Madagascar are located below the tropic of Capricorn, in the southern temperate zone.\n\n\nAfrica is highly biodiverse;[15] it is the continent with the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. However, Africa also is heavily affected by a wide range of environmental issues, including desertification, deforestation, water scarcity and pollution. These entrenched environmental concerns are expected to worsen as climate change impacts Africa. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified Africa as the continent most vulnerable to climate change.[16][17]\n\n\nThe history of Africa is long, complex, and has often been under-appreciated by the global historical community.[18] Africa, particularly Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes). The earliest hominids and their ancestors have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including *Sahelanthropus tchadensis*, *Australopithecus africanus*, *A. afarensis*, *Homo erectus*, *H. habilis* and *H. ergaster*—the earliest *Homo sapiens* (modern human) remains, found in Ethiopia, South Africa, and Morocco, date to circa 233,000, 259,000, and 300,000 years ago, respectively, and *Homo sapiens* is believed to have originated in Africa around 350,000–260,000 years ago.[a] Africa is also considered by anthropologists to be the most genetically diverse continent as a result of being the longest inhabited.[25][26][27]\n\n\nEarly human civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt and Carthage emerged in North Africa. Following a subsequent long and complex history of civilizations, migration and trade, Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. The last 400 years have witnessed an increasing European influence on the continent. Starting in the 16th century, this was driven by trade, including the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, which created large African diaspora populations in the Americas. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, European nations colonized almost all of Africa, reaching a point when only Ethiopia and Liberia were independent polities.[28] Most present states in Africa emerged from a process of decolonisation following World War II.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The totality of Africa seen by the Apollo 17 crew\n*Afri* was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known northern Africa to the west of the Nile river, and in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).[29][30] This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe, an ancestor of modern Berbers; see Terence for discussion. The name had usually been connected with the Phoenician word **ʿafar** meaning \"dust\",[31] but a 1981 hypothesis[32] has asserted that it stems from the Berber word *ifri* (plural *ifran*) meaning \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.[33] The same word[33] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as *Ifrane*) in northwestern Libya,[34] as well as the city of Ifrane in Morocco.\n\n\nUnder Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province it then named *Africa Proconsularis*, following its defeat of the Carthaginians in the Third Punic War in 146 BC, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[35] The Latin suffix *-ica* can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in *Celtica* from *Celtae*, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim region of Ifriqiya, following its conquest of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire's *Exarchatus Africae*, also preserved a form of the name.\n\n\nAccording to the Romans, Africa lies to the west of Egypt, while \"Asia\" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 CE), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of \"Africa\" expanded with their knowledge.\n\n\nOther etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name \"Africa\":\n\n\n\n* The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (*Ant. 1.15*) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.\n* Isidore of Seville in his 7th-century *Etymologiae* XIV.5.2. suggests \"Africa comes from the Latin *aprica*, meaning \"sunny\".\n* Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian *af-rui-ka*, meaning \"to turn toward the opening of the Ka.\" The Ka is the energetic double of every person and the \"opening of the Ka\" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, \"the birthplace.\"[36]\n* Michèle Fruyt in 1976 proposed[37] linking the Latin word with *africus* \"south wind\", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally \"rainy wind\".\n* Robert R. Stieglitz of Rutgers University in 1984 proposed: \"The name Africa, derived from the Latin \\*Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew Ophir ['rich'].\"[38]\n* Ibn Khallikan and some other historians claim that the name of Africa came from a Himyarite king called Afrikin ibn Kais ibn Saifi also called \"Afrikus son of Abraham\" who subdued Ifriqiya.[39][40][41]\n* Arabic *afrīqā* (feminine noun) and *ifrīqiyā*, now usually pronounced *afrīqiyā* (feminine) 'Africa', from *‘afara* [‘ = *‘ain*, not *’alif*] 'to be dusty' from *‘afar* 'dust, powder' and *‘afir* 'dried, dried up by the sun, withered' and *‘affara* 'to dry in the sun on hot sand' or 'to sprinkle with dust'.[42]\n* Possibly Phoenician *faraqa* in the sense of 'colony, separation'.[43]\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Africa\n\nFurther information: History of North Africa, History of West Africa, History of Central Africa, History of East Africa, and History of Southern Africa\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Africa\n\nSee also: Recent African origin of modern humans\n\n![](image)Lucy, an *Australopithecus afarensis* skeleton discovered 24 November 1974 in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia's Afar Depression\nAfrica is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth, with the Human species originating from the continent.[44] During the mid-20th century, anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (Before present, BP). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as *Australopithecus afarensis* radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0 million years BP,[45] *Paranthropus boisei* (c. 2.3–1.4 million years BP)[46] and *Homo ergaster* (c. 1.9 million–600,000 years BP) have been discovered.[7]\n\n\nAfter the evolution of *Homo sapiens* approximately 350,000 to 260,000 years BP in Africa,[20][21][22][23] the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers.[47][48] These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea,[49][50] the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco,[51][52] or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.[53]\n\n\nOther migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the Sahara.[54]\n\n\n\n### Emergence of civilization[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cradle of civilization § Ancient Egypt\n\nThe size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.[55] At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BCE, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub-Saharan Africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia.[56] However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the Earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.[57] The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.\n\n\n\n![](image)Saharan rock art in the Fezzan, Libya\nThe domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.[58] In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia.\n\n\nBetween 10,000 and 9,000 BC, pottery was independently invented in the region of Mali in the savannah of West Africa.[59][60]\n\n\nIn the steppes and savannahs of the Sahara and Sahel in Northern West Africa, people possibly ancestral to modern Nilo-Saharan and Mandé cultures started to collect wild millet,[61] around 8000 to 6000 BCE. Later, gourds, watermelons, castor beans, and cotton were also collected.[62] Sorghum was first domesticated in Eastern Sudan around 4000 BC, in one of the earliest instances of agriculture in human history. Its cultivation would gradually spread across Africa, before spreading to India around 2000 BC.[63][64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Colossal statues of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel, Egypt, date from around 1250 BC.\nPeople around modern-day Mauritania started making pottery and built stone settlements (e.g., Tichitt, Oualata). Fishing, using bone-tipped harpoons, became a major activity in the numerous streams and lakes formed from the increased rains.[65] In West Africa, the wet phase ushered in an expanding rainforest and wooded savanna from Senegal to Cameroon. Between 9,000 and 5,000 BC, Niger–Congo speakers domesticated the oil palm and raffia palm. Black-eyed peas and voandzeia (African groundnuts), were domesticated, followed by okra and kola nuts. Since most of the plants grew in the forest, the Niger–Congo speakers invented polished stone axes for clearing forest.[66]\n\n\nAround 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.[67] This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and encouraged migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.[67] During the first millennium BC, a reduction in wild grain populations related to changing climate conditions facilitated the expansion of farming communities and the rapid adoption of rice cultivation around the Niger River.[68][69]\n\n\nBy the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa. Around that time it also became established in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, either through independent invention there or diffusion from the north[70][71] and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, having lasted approximately 2,000 years,[72] and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions did not begin ironworking until the early centuries CE. Copper objects from Egypt, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.[67]\n\n\n\n### Early civilizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ancient Africa\n\n\n![](image)Diachronic map showing African empires spanning roughly 500 BC to 1500 AD\nAt about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilization of ancient Egypt.[73] One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC.[74][75] Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.[76]\n\n\nAn independent centre of civilization with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north-west African coast at Carthage.[77][78][79]\n\n\nEuropean exploration of Africa began with the ancient Greeks and Romans.[80][81] In 332 BC, Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian-occupied Egypt. He founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death.[82]\n\n\n\n![](image)Roman ruins of Timgad, in modern-day Algeria\n![](image)Ruins of the Punic district of Carthage\n![](image)Nubian pyramids at Meroë, Sudan\nFollowing the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first Roman emperor native to North Africa was Septimius Severus, born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libya – his mother was Italian Roman and his father was Punic.[83]\n\n\nChristianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia;[84] by 340 AD at the latest, it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire. Syro-Greek missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.[85]\n\n\nIn the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.[86]\n\n\nIn West Africa, Dhar Tichitt and Oualata in present-day Mauritania figure prominently among the early urban centers, dated to 2,000 BC. About 500 stone settlements litter the region in the former savannah of the Sahara. Its inhabitants fished and grew millet. It has been found by Augustin Holl that the Soninke of the Mandé peoples were likely responsible for constructing such settlements. Around 300 BCE, the region became more desiccated and the settlements began to decline, most likely relocating to Koumbi Saleh.[87] Architectural evidence and the comparison of pottery styles suggest that Dhar Tichitt was related to the subsequent Ghana Empire. Djenné-Djenno (in present-day Mali) was settled around 300 BC, and the town grew to house a sizable Iron Age population, as evidenced by crowded cemeteries. Living structures were made of sun-dried mud. By 250 BCE, Djenné-Djenno had become a large, thriving market town.[88][89]\n\n\nFurther south, in central Nigeria, around 1,500 BC, the Nok culture developed on the Jos Plateau. It was a highly centralized community. The Nok people produced lifelike representations in terracotta, including human heads and human figures, elephants, and other animals. By 500 BC, and possibly earlier, they were smelting iron. By 200 AD, the Nok culture had vanished.[71] and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, having lasted approximately 2,000 years. Based on stylistic similarities with the Nok terracottas, the bronze figurines of the Yoruba kingdom of Ife and those of the Bini kingdom of Benin are suggested to be continuations of the traditions of the earlier Nok culture.[90][72]\n\n\n\n\n### Ninth to eighteenth centuries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medieval and early modern Africa\n\n![](image)The intricate 9th-century bronzes from Igbo-Ukwu, in Nigeria displayed a level of technical accomplishment that was notably more advanced than European bronze casting of the same period.[91]\nPre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities[92] characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu-speaking peoples of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa; the large Sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan; Edo, Yoruba, and Igbo people in West Africa; and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa.\n\n\nBy the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.\n\n\nIn the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu. The bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century.[93]\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Ife, historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly oba ('king' or 'ruler' in the Yoruba language), called the *Ooni of Ife*. Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire, where its obas or kings, called the *Alaafins of Oyo*, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the Fon *Kingdom of Dahomey* was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruins of Great Zimbabwe (flourished eleventh to fifteenth centuries)\nThe Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.[94] The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized,[95] and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.[96]\n\n\nFollowing the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.[97] By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.\n\n\n\n### Height of the slave trade[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Trans-Saharan slave trade, Atlantic slave trade, and Indian Ocean slave trade\n\n![](image)Major slave trading regions of Africa, 15th–19th centuries.\nSlavery had long been practiced in Africa.[98][99] Between the 15th and the 19th centuries, the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the New World.[100][101][102] In addition, more than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.[103]\n\n\nIn West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.[104]\n\n\nAction was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against \"the usurping King of Lagos\", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.[105] The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of \"legitimate commerce\" in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.[106]\n\n\n\n### Colonialism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial Africa\n\n![](image)Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from Scramble for Africa.[edit]\nThe Scramble for Africa[b] was the conquest and colonisation of most of Africa by seven Western European powers driven by the Second Industrial Revolution during the era of \"New Imperialism\" (1833–1914). In 1870, 10% of the continent was formally under European control. By 1914, this figure had risen to almost 90%, with only Liberia, Ethiopia, and parts of present-day Libya retaining their full sovereignty.[c]\n\n\nThe 1884 Berlin Conference regulated European colonisation and trade in Africa, and is seen as emblematic of the \"scramble\".[108] In the last quarter of the 19th century, there were considerable political rivalries between the European empires, which provided the impetus for the colonisation.[109] The later years of the 19th century saw a transition from \"informal imperialism\" – military influence and economic dominance – to direct rule.[110]\n\n\n\nWith the decline of the European colonial empires in the wake of the two world wars, most African colonies gained independence during the Cold War, and decided to keep their colonial borders in the Organisation of African Unity conference of 1964 due to fears of civil wars and regional instability, placing emphasis on pan-Africanism.[111]\n\n### Independence struggles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)European control in 1939 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Belgian\n | Italian\n |\n| British\n | Portuguese\n |\n| French\n | Spanish\n |\n| Independent\n |  |\n\n\nImperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France.[112] Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957),[113] becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.\n\n\nPortugal's overseas presence in sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.\n\n\n\n### Post-colonial Africa[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Postcolonial Africa\n\nSee also: Decolonisation of Africa, Neocolonialism, CFA franc, Status of forces agreement, and Non-Aligned Movement\n\nToday, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since independence, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis – per the criteria laid out by Lührmann et al. (2018), only Botswana and Mauritius have been consistently democratic for the entirety of their post-colonial history. Most African countries have experienced several coups or periods of military dictatorship. Between 1990 and 2018, though, the continent as a whole has trended towards more democratic governance.[114]\n\n\nUpon independence an overwhelming majority of Africans lived in extreme poverty. The continent suffered from the lack of infrastructural or industrial development under colonial rule, along with political instability. With limited financial resources or access to global markets, relatively stable countries such as Kenya still experienced only very slow economic development. Only a handful of African countries succeeded in obtaining rapid economic growth prior to 1990. Exceptions include Libya and Equatorial Guinea, both of which possess large oil reserves.\n\n\nInstability throughout the continent after decolonization resulted primarily from marginalization of ethnic groups, and corruption. In pursuit of personal political gain, many leaders deliberately promoted ethnic conflicts, some of which had originated during the colonial period, such as from the grouping of multiple unrelated ethnic groups into a single colony, the splitting of a distinct ethnic group between multiple colonies, or existing conflicts being exacerbated by colonial rule (for instance, the preferential treatment given to ethnic Hutus over Tutsis in Rwanda during German and Belgian rule).\n\n\nFaced with increasingly frequent and severe violence, military rule was widely accepted by the population of many countries as means to maintain order, and during the 1970s and 1980s a majority of African countries were controlled by military dictatorships. Territorial disputes between nations and rebellions by groups seeking independence were also common in independent African states. The most devastating of these was the Nigerian Civil War, fought between government forces and an Igbo separatist republic, which resulted in a famine that killed 1–2 million people. Two civil wars in Sudan, the first lasting from 1955 to 1972 and the second from 1983 to 2005, collectively killed around 3 million. Both were fought primarily on ethnic and religious lines.\n\n\nCold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union also contributed to instability. Both the Soviet Union and the United States offered considerable incentives to African political and military leaders who aligned themselves with the superpowers' foreign policy. As an example, during the Angolan Civil War, the Soviet and Cuban aligned MPLA and the American aligned UNITA received the vast majority of their military and political support from these countries. Many African countries became highly dependent on foreign aid. The sudden loss of both Soviet and American aid at the end of the Cold War and fall of the USSR resulted in severe economic and political turmoil in the countries most dependent on foreign support.\n\n\nThere was a major famine in Ethiopia between 1983 and 1985, killing up to 1.2 million people, which most historians attribute primarily to the forced relocation of farmworkers and seizure of grain by communist Derg government, further exacerbated by the civil war.[115][116][117][118] In 1994 a genocide in Rwanda resulted in up to 800,000 deaths, added to a severe refugee crisis and fueled the rise of militia groups in neighboring countries. This contributed to the outbreak of the first and second Congo Wars, which were the most devastating military conflicts in modern Africa, with up to 5.5 million deaths,[119] making it by far the deadliest conflict in modern African history and one of the costliest wars in human history.[120]\n\n\n\n* ![An animated map shows the order of independence of African nations, 1950–2011](image)\n\nAn animated map shows the order of independence of African nations, 1950–2011\n* ![Africa's wars and conflicts, 1980–96   Major Wars/Conflict (>100,000 casualties)   Minor Wars/Conflict   Other Conflicts](image)\n\nAfrica's wars and conflicts, 1980–96  \nMajor Wars/Conflict (>100,000 casualties)\nMinor Wars/Conflict\nOther Conflicts\n* ![Political map of Africa in 2021](image)\n\nPolitical map of Africa in 2021\n\n\nVarious conflicts between various insurgent groups and governments continue. Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur (Sudan) which peaked in intensity from 2003 to 2005 with notable spikes in violence in 2007 and 2013–15, killing around 300,000 people total. The Boko Haram Insurgency primarily within Nigeria (with considerable fighting in Niger, Chad, and Cameroon as well) has killed around 350,000 people since 2009. Most African conflicts have been reduced to low-intensity conflicts as of 2022. However, the Tigray War which began in 2020 has killed an estimated 300,000–500,000 people, primarily due to famine.\n\n\nOverall though, violence across Africa has greatly declined in the 21st century, with the end of civil wars in Angola, Sierra Leone, and Algeria in 2002, Liberia in 2003, and Sudan and Burundi in 2005. The Second Congo War, which involved 9 countries and several insurgent groups, ended in 2003. This decline in violence coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms, which over the course of the 1990s and 2000s promoted the establishment of permanent, peaceful trade between neighboring countries (see Capitalist peace).\n\n\nImproved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China,[121] which further spurred economic growth. Between 2000 and 2014, annual GDP growth in sub-Saharan Africa averaged 5.02%, doubling its total GDP from $811 Billion to $1.63 Trillion (Constant 2015 USD).[122] North Africa experienced comparable growth rates.[123] A significant part of this growth can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.[124] While several individual countries have maintained high growth rates, since 2014 overall growth has considerably slowed, primarily as a result of falling commodity prices, continued lack of industrialization, and epidemics of Ebola and COVID-19.[125][126]\n\n\n\n## Geology, geography, ecology, and environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Africa\n\n![](image)Topography of Africa\nAfrica is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the Earth. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (transected by the Suez Canal), 163 km (101 mi) wide.[127] (Geopolitically, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa, as well.)[128]\n\n\nThe coastline is 26,000 km (16,000 mi) long, and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that Europe, which covers only 10,400,000 km2 (4,000,000 sq mi) – about a third of the surface of Africa – has a coastline of 32,000 km (20,000 mi).[129] From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka in Tunisia (37°21' N), to the most southerly point, Cape Agulhas in South Africa (34°51'15\" S), is a distance of approximately 8,000 km (5,000 mi).[130] Cape Verde, 17°33'22\" W, the westernmost point, is a distance of approximately 7,400 km (4,600 mi) to Ras Hafun, 51°27'52\" E, the most easterly projection that neighbours Cape Guardafui, the tip of the Horn of Africa.[129]\n\n\nAfrica's largest country is Algeria, and its smallest country is Seychelles, an archipelago off the east coast.[131] The smallest nation on the continental mainland is The Gambia.\n\n\n\n### African plate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Today, the African Plate is moving over Earth's surface at a speed of 0.292° ± 0.007° per million years, relative to the \"average\" Earth (NNR-MORVEL56)\nThis section is an excerpt from African Plate.[edit]\nThe African Plate, also known as the Nubian Plate, is a major tectonic plate that includes much of the continent of Africa (except for its easternmost part) and the adjacent oceanic crust to the west and south. It is bounded by the North American Plate and South American Plate to the west (separated by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge); the Arabian Plate and Somali Plate to the east; the Eurasian Plate, Aegean Sea Plate and Anatolian Plate to the north; and the Antarctic Plate to the south.\n\n\n\nBetween 60 million years ago and 10 million years ago, the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift.[132] Since the continent of Africa consists of crust from both the African and the Somali plates, some literature refers to the African Plate as the *Nubian Plate* to distinguish it from the continent as a whole.[133]\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Africa\n\nThe climate of Africa ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily desert, or arid, while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and dense jungle (rainforest) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on Earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.[134] The record for the highest-ever recorded temperature, in Libya in 1922 (58 °C (136 °F)), was discredited in 2013.[135][136]\n\n\n\n### Ecology and biodiversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The main biomes in Africa.\nAfrica has over 3,000 protected areas, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and arable land. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.[134]\n\n\nDeforestation is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).[137] According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world.[134] Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West Africa have been destroyed.[138] Over 90% of Madagascar's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago.[139] About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.[140]\n\n\n\nSee also: Afrotropical realm and Palearctic realm\n\n### Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Environmental issues in Africa.[edit]\nAfrican environmental issues are caused by human impacts on the natural environment and affect humans and nearly all forms of life. Issues include deforestation, soil degradation, air pollution, water pollution, garbage pollution, climate change and water scarcity (resulting in problems with access to safe water supply and sanitation).[141] These issues result in environmental conflict and are connected to broader social struggles for democracy and sovereignty.[142]\n\n### Water resources[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water scarcity in Africa and Water supply and sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa\n\nWater development and management are complex in Africa due to the multiplicity of trans-boundary water resources (rivers, lakes and aquifers).[143] Around 75% of sub-Saharan Africa falls within 53 international river basin catchments that traverse multiple borders.[144][143] This particular constraint can also be converted into an opportunity if the potential for trans-boundary cooperation is harnessed in the development of the area's water resources.[143] A multi-sectoral analysis of the Zambezi River, for example, shows that riparian cooperation could lead to a 23% increase in firm energy production without any additional investments.[144][143] A number of institutional and legal frameworks for transboundary cooperation exist, such as the Zambezi River Authority, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol, Volta River Authority and the Nile Basin Commission.[143] However, additional efforts are required to further develop political will, as well as the financial capacities and institutional frameworks needed for win-win multilateral cooperative actions and optimal solutions for all riparians.[143]\n\n![](image)Africa Water Precipitation\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate-smart agriculture and rainwater harvesting in Machakos County, Kenya.\nThis section is an excerpt from Climate change in Africa.[edit]\nClimate change in Africa is an increasingly serious threat as Africa is among the most vulnerable continents to the effects of climate change.[145][146][147] Some sources even classify Africa as \"the most vulnerable continent on Earth\".[148][149] Climate change and climate variability will likely reduce agricultural production, food security and water security.[150] As a result, there will be negative consequences on people's lives and sustainable development in Africa.[146]\n\n\n\nOver the coming decades, warming from climate change is expected across almost all the Earth's surface, and global mean rainfall will increase.[151] Currently, Africa is warming faster than the rest of the world on average. Large portions of the continent may become uninhabitable as a result of the rapid effects of climate change, which would have disastrous effects on human health, food security, and poverty.[152][153][154] Regional effects on rainfall in the tropics are expected to be much more spatially variable. The direction of change at any one location is often less certain.\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fauna of Africa\n\n![](image)Savanna at Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania\nAfrica boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and \"range of freedom\" of wild animal populations and diversity, with wild populations of large carnivores (such as lions, hyenas, and cheetahs) and herbivores (such as buffalo, elephants, camels, and giraffes) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of \"jungle\" animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians. In addition, Africa has the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna.\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of political parties in Africa by country\n\n### African Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: African Union\n\n![](image)Regions of the African Union:  \n  **Northern Region** ,  **Southern Region** ,  **Eastern Region** ,  **Western Regions A and B** ,  **Central Region** \nThe African Union (AU) is a continental union consisting of 55 member states. The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002[155] as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa.\n\n\nThe African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union, regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.\n\n\nExtensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Ivory Coast.\n\n\n\n### Boundary conflicts[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: The Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 and List of conflicts in Africa\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Military history of Africa § Post-colonial.[edit]\nAfrican nations have made great efforts to respect international borders as inviolate for a long time. For example, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which was established in 1963 and replaced by the African Union in 2002, set the respect for the territorial integrity of each country as one of its principles in OAU Charter.[156] Indeed, compared with the formation of European countries, there have been fewer international conflicts in Africa for changing the borders, which has influenced country formation there and has enabled some countries to survive that might have been defeated and absorbed by others.[157] Yet international conflicts have played out by support for proxy armies or rebel movements. Many states have experienced civil wars: including Rwanda, Sudan, Angola, Sierra Leone, Congo, Liberia, Ethiopia and Somalia.[158]\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Africa, List of African countries by GDP (nominal), and List of African countries by GDP (PPP)\n\nSee also: Economy of the African Union\n\n![](image)Map of the African Economic Community. CEN-SAD\n COMESA\n EAC\n ECCAS\n ECOWAS\n IGAD\n SADC\n UMA\n\nAlthough it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's poorest and least-developed continent (other than Antarctica), the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, low self-esteem, lack of access to foreign capital, legacies of colonialism, the slave trade, and the Cold War, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide).[159] Its total nominal GDP remains behind that of the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, India and France. According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.[160]\n\n\nPoverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the World Bank[161] announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). Eighty-one percent of the sub-Saharan African population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 86% for India.[162]\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,[163] indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.[164][165]\n\n\nAfrica is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries. The last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme (HIPC). The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in Africa. About ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in sub-Saharan Africa was resolved, Zambia fell back into debt. A small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in 2011, but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite.[166]\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity.\n\n\nIn a recently published analysis based on World Values Survey data, the Austrian political scientist Arno Tausch maintained that several African countries, most notably Ghana, perform quite well on scales of mass support for democracy and the market economy.[167]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (nominal, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| — | *![](image) African Union* | 2,945,709 | 2022\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Nigeria | 568,499 | 2014\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Egypt | 476,748 | 2022\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) South Africa | 458,708 | 2011\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Algeria | 224,107 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Ethiopia | 155,804 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Morocco | 147,343 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Angola | 145,712 | 2014\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Kenya | 113,701 | 2022\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Libya[168] | 92,542 | 2012\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Tanzania | 84,033 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (PPP, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| — | *![](image) African Union* | 8,865,179 | 2023\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Egypt | 1,809,425 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Nigeria | 1,365,903 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) South Africa | 997,444 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Algeria | 628,990 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Ethiopia | 393,297 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Morocco | 385,337 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Kenya | 338,964 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Angola | 260,323 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Tanzania | 227,725 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Ghana | 227,189 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\nTausch's global value comparison based on the World Values Survey derived the following factor analytical scales: 1. The non-violent and law-abiding society 2. Democracy movement 3. Climate of personal non-violence 4. Trust in institutions 5. Happiness, good health 6. No redistributive religious fundamentalism 7. Accepting the market 8. Feminism 9. Involvement in politics 10. Optimism and engagement 11. No welfare mentality, acceptancy of the Calvinist work ethics. The spread in the performance of African countries with complete data, Tausch concluded \"is really amazing\". While one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in Ghana, the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for Egypt and Algeria, and especially for Africa's leading economy, South Africa. High Human Inequality, as measured by the UNDP's Human Development Report's Index of Human Inequality, further impairs the development of human security. Tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism, corresponding to economic and human rights data, emerging from Africa, is reflected in the development of a civil society.\n\n\n\n![](image)African countries by GDP (PPP) per capita in 2020\nThe continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite,[169] 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium.[170] The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves.[171] Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.[172] As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis pushed 100 million people into food insecurity.[173]\n\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.[121]\n\n\nA Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. \"African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.\"[174]\n\n\n\n### Electricity generation[edit]\n\n\nThe main source of electricity is hydropower, which contributes significantly to the current installed capacity for energy.[143] The Kainji Dam is a typical hydropower resource generating electricity for all the large cities in Nigeria as well as their neighbouring country, Niger.[175] Hence, the continuous investment in the last decade, which has increased the amount of power generated.[143]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Africa, Genetic history of Africa, and Child marriage in Africa\n\nSee also: List of African countries by population and List of African countries by life expectancy\n\nProportion of total African population by country\n\n\n\nNigeria (15.38%)\nEthiopia (8.37%)\nEgypt (7.65%)\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (6.57%)\nTanzania (4.55%)\nSouth Africa (4.47%)\nKenya (3.88%)\nUganda (3.38%)\nAlgeria (3.36%)\nOther (42.39%)\n\nAfrica's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and is consequently relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.[176] The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.[177] As of 2021, the population of Africa is estimated at 1.4 billion [1][2]. Africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time – India and China's 1.4 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022.[178] This increase in number of babies born in Africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 37% in the year 2050; while in 1990 sub-Saharan Africa accounted for only 16% of the world's births.[179]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate (children per woman) for Sub-Saharan Africa is 4.7 as of 2018, the highest in the world.[180] All countries in sub-Saharan Africa had TFRs (average number of children) above replacement level in 2019 and accounted for 27.1% of global livebirths.[181] In 2021, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 29% of global births.[182]\n\n\nSpeakers of Bantu languages (part of the Niger–Congo family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from the Sahel progressively expanded over most of sub-Saharan Africa.[183] But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (\"San\" or \"Bushmen\") and Pygmy peoples in Southern and Central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also \"San\", closely related to, but distinct from \"Hottentots\") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa.[*citation needed*] Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.[184]\n\n\nThe peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger–Congo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan, and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Map of Africa indicating Human Development Index (2018).  |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0.800–0.849\n 0.750–0.799\n 0.700–0.749\n 0.650–0.699\n 0.600–0.649\n 0.550–0.599\n | 0.500–0.549\n 0.450–0.499\n 0.400–0.449\n ≤ 0.399\n No data\n |\n |\n\n\nThe peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century CE introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.[185] The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.[186]\n\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.\n\n\nPrior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[187] Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million *pieds-noirs* in North Africa),[188] Kenya, Congo,[189] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[190] Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone.[191] Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Réunion, and South Africa.[192] The country with the largest white African population is South Africa.[193] Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.[194]\n\n\nEuropean colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese[121] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.[195]\n\n\n\n### Alternative Estimates of African Population, 0–2018 AD (in thousands)[edit]\n\n\nSource: Maddison and others.

However, in formal surveys or census, most people will identify with major religions that came from outside the continent, mainly through colonisation. There are several reasons for this, the main one being the colonial idea that African religious beliefs and practices are not good enough. Religious beliefs and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive topic for governments with mixed religious populations.[201][202] According to the *World Book Encyclopedia*, Islam and Christianity are the two largest religions in Africa. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow traditional religions.[*citation needed*] A small number of Africans are Hindu, Buddhist, Confucianist, Baháʼí, or Jewish. There is also a minority of people in Africa who are irreligious.\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Africa\n\nSee also: Writing systems of Africa § Indigenous writing systems\n\nBy most estimates, well over a thousand languages (UNESCO has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.[203] Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well.[*further explanation needed*] There are four major groups indigenous to Africa:\n\n\n\n![](image)A simplistic view of language families spoken in Africa\n* The *Afroasiatic* languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the Horn of Africa, North Africa, the Sahel, and Southwest Asia.\n* The *Nilo-Saharan* languages consist of a group of several possibly related families,[204] spoken by 30 million people between 100 languages. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, and northern Tanzania.\n* The *Niger-Congo* language family covers much of sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of number of languages, it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps one of the largest in the world.\n* The *Khoisan* languages form a group of three unrelated[205] families and two isolates and number about fifty in total. They are mainly spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 400,000 people.[206] Many of the Khoisan languages are endangered. The Khoi and San peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.\n\n\nFollowing the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (*see African French*) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate. In total, at least a fifth of Africans speak the former colonial languages.[207][208][209][d]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa, total (% of population ages 15–49), in 2011 (World Bank) \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| over 15%\n 5–15%\n 2–5%\n 1–2%\n 0.5-1%\n 0.1–0.5%\n not available\n |\n\n\nMore than 85% of individuals in Africa use traditional medicine as an alternative to often expensive allopathic medical health care and costly pharmaceutical products. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) Heads of State and Government declared the 2000s decade as the African Decade on African traditional medicine in an effort to promote The WHO African Region's adopted resolution for institutionalizing traditional medicine in health care systems across the continent.[210] Public policy makers in the region are challenged with consideration of the importance of traditional/indigenous health systems and whether their coexistence with the modern medical and health sub-sector would improve the equitability and accessibility of health care distribution, the health status of populations, and the social-economic development of nations within sub-Saharan Africa.[211]\n\n\nAIDS in post-colonial Africa is a prevalent issue. Although the continent is home to about 15.2 percent of the world's population,[212] more than two-thirds of the total infected worldwide – some 35 million people – were Africans, of whom 15 million have already died.[213] Sub-Saharan Africa alone accounted for an estimated 69 percent of all people living with HIV[214] and 70 percent of all AIDS deaths in 2011.[215] In the countries of sub-Saharan Africa most affected, AIDS has raised death rates and lowered life expectancy among adults between the ages of 20 and 49 by about twenty years.[213] Furthermore, the life expectancy in many parts of Africa has declined, largely as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic with life-expectancy in some countries reaching as low as thirty-four years.[216]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Africa\n\n![](image)The Senegambian stone circles, lying in The Gambia and Senegal, are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nSome aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.[217] Leopold II of Belgium attempted to \"civilize\" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.[217]\n\n\nObidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.[218] According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, \"The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art.\"[219] Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects \"lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.[219] Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that \"the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art.\"[220] Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the \"traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe.\"[221] On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)assert themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies.\"[222]\n\n\nThere is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.\n\n\nAs of March 2023, 98 African properties are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. Among these proprieties, 54 are cultural sites, 39 are natural sites and 5 are mixed sites. The List Of World Heritage in Danger includes 15 African sites.[223]\n\n\n\n### Visual art[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nok figure (5th century BCE-5th century CE)\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from African art.[edit]\nAfrican art describes the modern and historical paintings, sculptures, installations, and other visual culture from native or indigenous Africans and the African continent. The definition may also include the art of the African diasporas, such as: African-American, Caribbean or art in South American societies inspired by African traditions. Despite this diversity, there are unifying artistic themes present when considering the totality of the visual culture from the continent of Africa.[224]\n\n\nPottery, metalwork, sculpture, architecture, textile art and fiber art are important visual art forms across Africa and may be included in the study of African art. The term \"African art\" does not usually include the art of the North African areas along the Mediterranean coast, as such areas had long been part of different traditions. For more than a millennium, the art of such areas had formed part of Berber or Islamic art, although with many particular local characteristics.\n\n\nThe Art of Ethiopia, with a long Christian tradition,[225] is also different from that of most of Africa, where the Traditional African religion (with Islam in the north) was dominant until the 20th century.[226] African art includes prehistoric and ancient art, the Islamic art of West Africa, the Christian art of East Africa, and the traditional artifacts of these and other regions. Many African sculptures were historically made of wood and other natural materials that have not survived from earlier than a few centuries ago, although rare older pottery and metal figures can be found in some areas.[227] Some of the earliest decorative objects, such as shell beads and evidence of paint, have been discovered in Africa, dating to the Middle Stone Age.[228][229][230] Masks are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, and are often highly Stylized. There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin and depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among \"groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the Niger and Congo rivers\" in West Africa.[231] Direct images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for ritual ceremonies. Since the late 19th century there has been an increasing amount of African art in Western collections, the finest pieces of which are displayed as part of the history of colonization.\n\n\nAfrican art has had an important influence on European Modernist art,[232] which was inspired by their interest in abstract depiction. It was this appreciation of African sculpture that has been attributed to the very concept of \"African art\", as seen by European and American artists and art historians.[233]\n\n\n\nWest African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs, like the famous Benin Bronzes, to decorate palaces and for highly naturalistic royal heads from around the Bini town of Benin City, Edo State, as well as in terracotta or metal, from the 12th–14th centuries. Akan gold weights are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400–1900; some represent proverbs, contributing a narrative element rare in African sculpture; and royal regalia included gold sculptured elements.[234] Many West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings. The Mande-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces from wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs shaped like cylinders. In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Architecture of Africa.[edit]\n![](image)The Great Pyramids of Giza are regarded as one of the greatest architectural feats of all time and are one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World\nLike other aspects of the culture of Africa, the architecture of Africa is exceptionally diverse. Throughout the history of Africa, Africans have developed their own local architectural traditions. In some cases, broader regional styles can be identified, such as the Sudano-Sahelian architecture of West Africa. A common theme in traditional African architecture is the use of fractal scaling: small parts of the structure tend to look similar to larger parts, such as a circular village made of circular houses.[235]\n\n\nAfrican architecture in some areas has been influenced by external cultures for centuries, according to available evidence. Western architecture has influenced coastal areas since the late 15th century and is now an important source of inspiration for many larger buildings, particularly in major cities.\n\n\n\nAfrican architecture uses a wide range of materials, including thatch, stick/wood, mud, mudbrick, rammed earth, and stone. These material preferences vary by region: North Africa for stone and rammed earth, the Horn of Africa for stone and mortar, West Africa for mud/adobe, Central Africa for thatch/wood and more perishable materials, Southeast and Southern Africa for stone and thatch/wood.\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Cinema of Africa.[edit]\n![](image)Cinematic street poster in Tunis, Tunisia for the Egyptian film *Saladin the Victorious* (1963, Arabic: الناصر صلاح الدين, Al Nasser Salah Ad-Din) directed by Youssef Chahine starring Ahmed Mazhar as Saladin, Salah Zulfikar, Nadia Lutfi and others.\nCinema of Africa covers both the history and present of the making or screening of films on the African continent, and also refers to the persons involved in this form of audiovisual culture. It dates back to the early 20th century, when film reels were the primary cinematic technology in use. As there are more than 50 countries with audiovisual traditions, there is no one single 'African cinema'. Both historically and culturally, there are major regional differences between North African and sub-Saharan cinemas, and between the cinemas of different countries.[236]\n\n\n\nThe Cinema of Egypt and the Cinema of Tunisia are among the oldest in the world. Cinema of Egypt in particular is the most established and flourishing industry in Africa.[237][238] Pioneers Auguste and Louis Lumière screened their films in Alexandria, Cairo, Tunis, Susa, Libya and Hammam-Lif, Tunisia in 1896.[239][240] Albert Samama Chikly is often cited as the first producer of indigenous African cinema, screening his own short documentaries in the casino of Tunis as early as December 1905.[241] Alongside his daughter Haydée Tamzali, Chikly would go on to produce important early milestones such as 1924's *The Girl from Carthage*. In 1927, Egypt produced *Laila* the first feature-length film by Aziza Amir. In 1935, the Studio Misr in Cairo began producing mostly formulaic comedies and musicals, but also films like Kamal Selim's *The Will* (1939). Egyptian cinema flourished in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, considered its Golden Age.[242] Youssef Chahine's seminal *Cairo Station* (1958) laid the foundation for Arab film.[243]\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Music of Africa.[edit]\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **may require copy editing for grammar, style, cohesion, tone, or spelling**. You can assist by editing it. *(April 2024)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nGiven the vastness of the African continent, its music is diverse, with regions and nations having many distinct musical traditions. African music includes the genres makwaya, highlife, mbube, township music, jùjú, fuji, jaiva, afrobeat, afrofusion, mbalax, Congolese rumba, soukous, ndombolo, makossa, kizomba, taarab and others.[244] African music also uses a large variety of instruments from all across the continent. The music and dance of the African diaspora, formed to varying degrees on African musical traditions, include American music like Dixieland jazz, blues, jazz, and many Caribbean genres, such as calypso (see kaiso) and soca. Latin American music genres such as cumbia, salsa music, son cubano, rumba, conga, bomba, samba and zouk were founded on the music of enslaved Africans, and have in turn influenced African popular music.[244][245]\n\n\n\nLike the music of Asia, India and the Middle East, it is a highly rhythmic music. The complex rhythmic patterns often involving one rhythm played against another to create a polyrhythm. The most common polyrhythm plays three beats on top of two, like a triplet played against straight notes. Sub-Saharan African music traditions frequently rely on percussion instruments of many varieties, including xylophones, djembes, drums, and tone-producing instruments such as the mbira or \"thumb piano.\"[245][246]\n\n### Dance[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from African dance.[edit]\nAfrican dance (also Afro dance, Afrodance and Afro-dance)[247][248][249][250][251] refers to the various dance styles of sub-Saharan Africa. These dances are closely connected with the traditional rhythms and music traditions of the region. Music and dancing is an integral part of many traditional African societies. Songs and dances facilitate teaching and promoting social values, celebrating special events and major life milestones, performing oral history and other recitations, and spiritual experiences.[252] African dance uses the concepts of polyrhythm and total body articulation.[253] African dances are a collective activity performed in large groups, with significant interaction between dancers and onlookers in the majority of styles.[254]\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Best results of African men's national football teams at the FIFA World Cup\n![Crowd_in_Cairo_Stadium](image)Crowd in Cairo Stadium, Egypt has won the Africa Cup of Nations for seven times [255]\nFifty-four African countries have football teams in the Confederation of African Football. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Morocco, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. Morocco made history at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as the first African nation to reach the semi-finals of the FIFA Men's World Cup. South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament, becoming the first African country to do so. The top clubs in each African football league play the CAF Champions League, while lower-ranked clubs compete in CAF Confederation Cup.\n\n\nIn recent years, the continent has made major progress in terms of state-of-the-art basketball facilities which have been built in cites as diverse as Cairo, Dakar, Johannesburg, Kigali, Luanda and Rades.[256] The number of African basketball players who drafted into the NBA has experienced major growth in the 2010s.[257]\n\n\nCricket is popular in some African nations. South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. Morocco in northern Africa has also hosted the 2002 Morocco Cup, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament.\n\n\nRugby is popular in several southern African nations. Namibia and Zimbabwe both have appeared on multiple occasions at the Rugby World Cup, while South Africa is the joint-most successful national team (alongside New Zealand) at the Rugby World Cup, having won the tournament on 3 occasions, in 1995, 2007, and 2019.[258]\n\n\n\n## Territories and regions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of regions of Africa and List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa\n\n![](image)\nAlgeria\n\nTogo\n\nBenin\n\nBotswana\n\nCameroon\n\nCent Afr Rep\n\nChad\n\nDemocratic  \nRepublic of  \nthe Congo\n\nDjibouti\n\nEgypt\n\nEquatorial Guinea\n\nEritrea\n\nEthiopia\n\nCape\\*  \nVerde\nLibya\n\nMali\n\nGhana\n\nSierra  \nLeone\n\nIvory  \nCoast\n\nBurkina  \nFaso\n\nMauritania\n\nMorocco\n\nSão Tomé  \nand Príncipe\\*\n\nGabon\n\nNamibia\n\nNiger\n\nNigeria\nCongo\n\nSomalia\n\nSomaliland\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSudan\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nTunisia\n\nWestern  \nSahara\n\nSenegal\n\nThe Gambia\n\nGuinea-  \nBissau\n\nGuinea\n\nKenya\n\nLiberia\nMadagascar\n\nMalawi\n\nMozambique\n\nBurundi\n\nRwanda\n\nUganda\n\nTanzania\n\nAngola\n\nSaint Helena (UK)\\*\n\nLesotho\n\nEswatini\n\nZambia\n\nZimbabwe\nMauritius\\*\n\nRéunion\\*\n\n\\*Comoros\n\nSeychelles\n\nAtlantic  \nOcean\n\nAtlantic  \nOcean\n\nIndian  \nOcean\n\nStrait of Gibraltar\n\nMediterranean Sea\n\nRed  \n  Sea\n\nThe countries in this table are categorized according to the scheme for geographic subregions used by the United Nations, and data included are per sources in cross-referenced articles.

The name is still extant today as *Ifira* and *Ifri-n-Dellal* in Greater Kabylia (Algeria). A Berber tribe was called *Beni-Ifren* in the Middle Ages and *Ifurace* was the name of a Tripolitan people in the 6th century. The name is from the Berber language *ifri* 'cave'. Troglodytism was frequent in northern Africa and still occurs today in southern Tunisia. Herodote wrote that the Garamantes, a North African people, used to live in caves. The Ancient Greek called *troglodytēs* an African people who lived in caves. *Africa* was coined by the Romans and '*Ifriqiyeh*' is the arabized Latin name.

Istanbul is a transcontinental city which straddles both Asia and Europe.\n* c. **^** \"Europe\" as defined by the International Monetary Fund.\n |\n\n\n**Europe** is a continent[a] comprising the westernmost peninsulas of Eurasia,[12][13] located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Africa and Asia. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea and the waterways of the Turkish straits.[14]\n\n\nEurope covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 745 million (about 10% of the world population) in 2021; the third-largest after Asia and Africa.[2][3] The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.\n\n\nEuropean culture is the root of Western civilisation, which traces its lineage back to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.[15][16] The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and the related Migration Period marked the end of Europe's ancient history, and the beginning of the Middle Ages. The Italian Renaissance began in Florence and spread to the rest of the continent, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, exploration, art, and science which contributed to the beginning of the modern era. Since the Age of Discovery, led by Spain and Portugal, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs with multiple explorations and conquests around the world.\nBetween the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers colonised at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania, and the majority of Asia.\n\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in Western Europe and eventually the wider world. Both world wars began and were fought to a great extent in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence.[17] During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East, until the Revolutions of 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) and the Council of Europe are two important international organisations aiming to represent the European continent on a political level. The Council of Europe was founded in 1948 with the idea of unifying Europe[18] to achieve common goals and prevent future wars. Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union, a separate supranational political entity based on a system of European law that lies between a confederation and a federation.[19] The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. A majority of its members have adopted a common currency, the euro, and participate in the European single market and a customs union. A large bloc of countries, the Schengen Area, have also abolished internal border and immigration controls. Regular popular elections take place every five years within the EU; they are considered to be the second largest democratic elections in the world after India's.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information: Europa (consort of Zeus)\n\n![](image)First map of the world according to Anaximander (6th century BCE)\nIn classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient Greek: Εὐρώπη, *Eurṓpē*) was a Phoenician princess. One view is that her name derives from the Ancient Greek elements εὐρύς (*eurús*) 'wide, broad', and ὤψ (*ōps*, gen. ὠπός, *ōpós*) 'eye, face, countenance', hence their composite *Eurṓpē* would mean 'wide-gazing' or 'broad of aspect'.[20][21][22][23] *Broad* has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion and the poetry devoted to it.[20] An alternative view is that of Robert Beekes, who has argued in favour of a Pre-Indo-European origin for the name, explaining that a derivation from *eurus* would yield a different toponym than Europa. Beekes has located toponyms related to that of Europa in the territory of ancient Greece, and localities such as that of Europos in ancient Macedonia.[24]\n\n\nThere have been attempts to connect *Eurṓpē* to a Semitic term for *west*, this being either Akkadian *erebu* meaning 'to go down, set' (said of the sun) or Phoenician *'ereb* 'evening, west',[25] which is at the origin of Arabic *maghreb* and Hebrew *ma'arav*. Martin Litchfield West stated that \"phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor\",[26] while Beekes considers a connection to Semitic languages improbable.[24]\n\n\nMost major world languages use words derived from *Eurṓpē* or *Europa* to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word *Ōuzhōu* (歐洲/欧洲), which is an abbreviation of the transliterated name *Ōuluóbā zhōu* (歐羅巴洲) (*zhōu* means \"continent\"); a similar Chinese-derived term *Ōshū* (欧州) is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, *Ōshū Rengō* (欧州連合), despite the katakana *Yōroppa* (ヨーロッパ) being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages, the originally Persian name *Frangistan* ('land of the Franks') is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as *Avrupa* or *Evropa*.[27]\n\n\n\n## Definition[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Boundaries between the continents of Earth § Asia and Europe\n\nSee also: List of transcontinental countries\n\n### Contemporary definition[edit]\n\n\nClickable map of Europe, showing one of the most commonly used continental boundaries[b]   \n**Key:** **blue**: states which straddle the border between Europe and Asia;\n**green**: countries not geographically in Europe, but closely associated with the continent\n\n![](image)\nAlb.\n\nAndorra\n\nAustria\n\nAzer.\n\nBelarus\n\nBelg.\n\nBosnia\n\nBulgaria\n\n*Channel  \nIs.*\n\nCroatia\n\nCzech  \nRep.\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\n*Gib.

Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to Anatolia (or Asia Minor), but is considered part of Europe politically and it is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of North-western Africa for centuries, but now it is considered to be part of Europe as well.[29] \"Europe\", as used specifically in British English, may also refer to Continental Europe exclusively.[30]\n\n\nThe term \"continent\" usually implies the physical geography of a large land mass completely or almost completely surrounded by water at its borders. Prior to the adoption of the current convention that includes mountain divides, the border between Europe and Asia had been redefined several times since its first conception in classical antiquity, but always as a series of rivers, seas and straits that were believed to extend an unknown distance east and north from the Mediterranean Sea without the inclusion of any mountain ranges. Cartographer Herman Moll suggested in 1715 Europe was bounded by a series of partly-joined waterways directed towards the Turkish straits, and the Irtysh River draining into the upper part of the Ob River and the Arctic Ocean. In contrast, the present eastern boundary of Europe partially adheres to the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, which is somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent compared to any clear-cut definition of the term \"continent\".\n\n\nThe current division of Eurasia into two continents now reflects East-West cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The geographic border between Europe and Asia does not follow any state boundaries and now only follows a few bodies of water. Turkey is generally considered a transcontinental country divided entirely by water, while Russia and Kazakhstan are only partly divided by waterways. France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain are also transcontinental (or more properly, intercontinental, when oceans or large seas are involved) in that their main land areas are in Europe while pockets of their territories are located on other continents separated from Europe by large bodies of water. Spain, for example, has territories south of the Mediterranean Sea—namely, Ceuta and Melilla—which are parts of Africa and share a border with Morocco. According to the current convention, Georgia and Azerbaijan are transcontinental countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains as the divide between continents.\n\n\n\n### History of the concept[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boundary between Europe and Asia\n\n#### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Depiction of *Europa regina* ('Queen Europe') in 1582\nThe first recorded usage of *Eurṓpē* as a geographic term is in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BCE by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni River on the territory of Georgia) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE.[31] Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts—Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa)—with the Nile and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.[32] Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don.[33] The *Book of Jubilees* described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from Northwest Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.[34]\n\n\nThe convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used by Roman-era authors such as Posidonius,[35] Strabo[36] and Ptolemy,[37] who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.\n\n\nThe Roman Empire did not attach a strong identity to the concept of continental divisions. However, following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the culture that developed in its place, linked to Latin and the Catholic church, began to associate itself with the concept of \"Europe\".[38] The term \"Europe\" is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church, as opposed to both the Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world.\n\n\nA cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam, and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.[39][40] The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance: *Europa* often[*dubious – discuss*] figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin.[41] The transition of Europe to being a cultural term as well as a geographic one led to the borders of Europe being affected by cultural considerations in the East, especially relating to areas under Byzantine, Ottoman, and Russian influence. Such questions were affected by the positive connotations associated with the term Europe by its users. Such cultural considerations were not applied to the Americas, despite their conquest and settlement by European states. Instead, the concept of \"Western civilization\" emerged as a way of grouping together Europe and these colonies.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Modern definitions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Regions of Europe and Continental Europe\n\n![](image)*A New Map of Europe According to the Newest Observations* (1721) by Hermann Moll draws the eastern boundary of Europe along the Don River flowing south-west and the Tobol, Irtysh and Ob rivers flowing north.\n![](image)1916 political map of Europe showing most of Moll's waterways replaced by von Strahlenberg's Ural Mountains and Freshfield's Caucasus Crest, land features of a type that normally defines a subcontinent\nThe question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of Muscovy began to include North Asia. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of Eurasia into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the Turkish Straits, the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and the Don (ancient Tanais). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at Kalach-na-Donu (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the Volga–Don Canal), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.\n\n\nAround 1715, Herman Moll produced a map showing the northern part of the Ob River and the Irtysh River, a major tributary of the Ob, as components of a series of partly-joined waterways taking the boundary between Europe and Asia from the Turkish Straits, and the Don River all the way to the Arctic Ocean. In 1721, he produced a more up to date map that was easier to read. However, his proposal to adhere to major rivers as the line of demarcation was never taken up by other geographers who were beginning to move away from the idea of water boundaries as the only legitimate divides between Europe and Asia.\n\n\nFour years later, in 1725, Philip Johan von Strahlenberg was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary. He drew a new line along the Volga, following the Volga north until the Samara Bend, along Obshchy Syrt (the drainage divide between the Volga and Ural Rivers), then north and east along the latter waterway to its source in the Ural Mountains. At this point he proposed that mountain ranges could be included as boundaries between continents as alternatives to nearby waterways. Accordingly, he drew the new boundary north along Ural Mountains rather than the nearby and parallel running Ob and Irtysh rivers.[43] This was endorsed by the Russian Empire and introduced the convention that would eventually become commonly accepted. However, this did not come without criticism. Voltaire, writing in 1760 about Peter the Great's efforts to make Russia more European, ignored the whole boundary question with his claim that neither Russia, Scandinavia, northern Germany, nor Poland were fully part of Europe.[38] Since then, many modern analytical geographers like Halford Mackinder have declared that they see little validity in the Ural Mountains as a boundary between continents.[44]\n\n\nThe mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The 1745 atlas published by the Russian Academy of Sciences has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as Serafimovich before cutting north towards Arkhangelsk, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as John Cary followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the Kuma–Manych Depression was identified c. 1773 by a German naturalist, Peter Simon Pallas, as a valley that once connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,[45][46] and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.\n\n\nBy the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the Volga–Don Canal and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the Greater Caucasus watershed to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a \"controversy\" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with Douglas Freshfield advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the \"best possible\", citing support from various \"modern geographers\".[47]\n\n\nIn Russia and the Soviet Union, the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.[48] In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from Baydaratskaya Bay, on the Kara Sea, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the Ural River until the Mugodzhar Hills, and then the Emba River; and Kuma–Manych Depression,[49] thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.[50] However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest,[51] and this became the common convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.\n\n\nSome view the separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism: \"In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].\"[52]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Europe\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Europe\n\n![](image)Last Glacial Maximum refugia, c. 20,000 years ago  \n Solutrean culture\n Epigravettian culture[53]\n\n![](image)Paleolithic cave paintings from Lascaux in France (c. 15,000 BCE)\n![](image)Stonehenge in the United Kingdom (Late Neolithic from 3000 to 2000 BCE)\nDuring the 2.5 million years of the Pleistocene, numerous cold phases called glacials (Quaternary ice age), or significant advances of continental ice sheets, in Europe and North America, occurred at intervals of approximately 40,000 to 100,000 years. The long glacial periods were separated by more temperate and shorter interglacials which lasted about 10,000–15,000 years. The last cold episode of the last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago.[54] Earth is currently in an interglacial period of the Quaternary, called the Holocene.[55]\n\n\n*Homo erectus georgicus*, which lived roughly 1.8 million years ago in Georgia, is the earliest hominin to have been discovered in Europe.[56] Other hominin remains, dating back roughly 1 million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca, Spain.[57] Neanderthal man (named after the Neandertal valley in Germany) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago (115,000 years ago it is found already in the territory of present-day Poland[58]) and disappeared from the fossil record about 40,000 years ago,[59] with their final refuge being the Iberian Peninsula. The Neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans (Cro-Magnons), who appeared in Europe around 43,000 to 40,000 years ago.[60] Homo sapiens arrived in Europe around 54,000 years ago, some 10,000 years earlier than previously thought.[61] The earliest sites in Europe dated 48,000 years ago are Riparo Mochi (Italy), Geissenklösterle (Germany) and Isturitz (France).[62][63]\n\n\nThe European Neolithic period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BCE in Greece and the Balkans, probably influenced by earlier farming practices in Anatolia and the Near East.[64] It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the Danube and the Rhine (Linear Pottery culture), and along the Mediterranean coast (Cardial culture). Between 4500 and 3000 BCE, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artifacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as causewayed enclosures, burial mounds and megalithic tombs.[65] The Corded Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic. During this period giant megalithic monuments, such as the Megalithic Temples of Malta and Stonehenge, were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe.[66][67]\n\n\nThe modern native populations of Europe largely descend from three distinct lineages:[68] Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from populations associated with the Paleolithic Epigravettian culture;[53] Neolithic Early European Farmers who migrated from Anatolia during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago;[69] and Yamnaya Steppe herders who expanded into Europe from the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Ukraine and southern Russia in the context of Indo-European migrations 5,000 years ago.[68][70] The European Bronze Age began c. 3200 BCE in Greece with the Minoan civilisation on Crete, the first advanced civilisation in Europe.[71] The Minoans were followed by the Myceneans, who collapsed suddenly around 1200 BCE, ushering the European Iron Age.[72] Iron Age colonisation by the Greeks and Phoenicians gave rise to early Mediterranean cities. Early Iron Age Italy and Greece from around the 8th century BCE gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity, whose beginning is sometimes dated to 776 BCE, the year of the first Olympic Games.[73]\n\n\n\n### Classical antiquity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Classical antiquity\n\nSee also: Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome\n\n![](image)The Parthenon in Athens (432 BCE)\nAncient Greece was the founding culture of Western civilisation. Western democratic and rationalist culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece.[74] The Greek city-state, the polis, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece.[74] In 508 BCE, Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in Athens.[75] The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy, humanism and rationalism under Aristotle, Socrates and Plato; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer;[76] in drama with Sophocles and Euripides, in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen; and in science with Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes.[77][78][79] In the course of the 5th century BCE, several of the Greek city states would ultimately check the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars, considered a pivotal moment in world history,[80] as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilisation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Animation showing the growth and division of Ancient Rome (years CE)\nGreece was followed by Rome, which left its mark on law, politics, language, engineering, architecture, government and many more key aspects in western civilisation.[74] By 200 BCE, Rome had conquered Italy and over the following two centuries it conquered Greece and Hispania (Spain and Portugal), the North African coast, much of the Middle East, Gaul (France and Belgium) and Britannia (England and Wales).\n\n\nExpanding from their base in central Italy beginning in the third century BCE, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean Basin and Western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The Roman Republic ended in 27 BCE, when Augustus proclaimed the Roman Empire. The two centuries that followed are known as the *pax romana*, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity and political stability in most of Europe.[81] The empire continued to expand under emperors such as Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting Germanic, Pictish and Scottish tribes.[82][83] Christianity was legalised by Constantine I in 313 CE after three centuries of imperial persecution. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul) which was renamed Constantinople in his honour in 330 CE. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 CE and in 391–392 CE, the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions.[84] This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE; the closure of the pagan Platonic Academy of Athens in 529 CE;[85] or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century CE. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was one of the most powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in Europe.[86]\n\n\n\n### Early Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages\n\nSee also: Dark Ages and Age of Migrations\n\n![](image)\nEurope c. 650\n![](image)\nCharlemagne's empire in 814:      Francia,      Tributaries\n\nDuring the decline of the Roman Empire, Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the \"Age of Migrations\". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Slavs, Avars, Bulgars and, later on, the Vikings, Pechenegs, Cumans and Magyars.[81] Renaissance thinkers such as Petrarch would later refer to this as the \"Dark Ages\".[87]\n\n\nIsolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe, though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.[88]\n\n\nWhile the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural and military force in Europe. Emperor Justinian I presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a legal code that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the Hagia Sophia and brought the Christian church under state control.[89]\n\n\nFrom the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring Sasanid Persians were severely weakened due to the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent Byzantine–Sasanian wars, the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into Asia Minor. In the mid-7th century, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region.[90] Over the next centuries Muslim forces took Cyprus, Malta, Crete, Sicily and parts of southern Italy.[91] Between 711 and 720, most of the lands of the Visigothic Kingdom of Iberia was brought under Muslim rule—save for small areas in the north-west (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. This territory, under the Arabic name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad Caliphate. The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, which ended their northward advance. In the remote regions of north-western Iberia and the middle Pyrenees the power of the Muslims in the south was scarcely felt. It was here that the foundations of the Christian kingdoms of Asturias, Leon and Galicia were laid and from where the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula would start. However, no coordinated attempt would be made to drive the Moors out. The Christian kingdoms were mainly focused on their own internal power struggles. As a result, the Reconquista took the greater part of eight hundred years, in which period a long list of Alfonsos, Sanchos, Ordoños, Ramiros, Fernandos and Bermudos would be fighting their Christian rivals as much as the Muslim invaders.\n\n\n\n![](image)Viking raids and division of the Frankish Empire at the Treaty of Verdun in 843\nDuring the Dark Ages, the Western Roman Empire fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe, respectively.[92] Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under Clovis I.[93] Charlemagne, a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed \"Holy Roman Emperor\" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.[94]\n\n\nEast Central Europe saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (c. 1000 CE). The powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and causing a series of armed conflicts with East Francia. Further south, the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted Christianity: the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire) and the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia). To the East, Kievan Rus' expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the religion of state.[95][96] Further East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.[97]\n\n\n\n### High and Late Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, and Middle Ages\n\nSee also: Medieval demography\n\n![](image)The maritime republics of medieval Italy reestablished contacts between Europe, Asia and Africa with extensive trade networks and colonies across the Mediterranean, and had an essential role in the Crusades.[98][99]\nThe period between the year 1000 and 1250 is known as the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages until c. 1500.\n\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the Renaissance of the 12th century. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the Maritime Republics a leading role in the European scene.\n\n\nThe Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. Feudalism developed in France in the Early Middle Ages, and soon spread throughout Europe.[100] A struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the *Magna Carta* and the establishment of a parliament.[101] The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman Catholic Church. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tancred of Sicily and Philip II of France, during the Third Crusade (1189–1192)\nThe Papacy reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An East-West Schism in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for a crusade against Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land.[102] In Europe itself, the Church organised the Inquisition against heretics. In the Iberian Peninsula, the Reconquista concluded with the fall of Granada in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the south-western peninsula.[103]\n\n\nIn the east, a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims, and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.[104] The Empire was weakened following the defeat at Manzikert, and was weakened considerably by the sack of Constantinople in 1204, during the Fourth Crusade.[105][106][107][108][109][110][111][112][113] Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, Byzantium fell in 1453 when Constantinople was taken by the Ottoman Empire.[114][115][116]\n\n\n\n![](image)The sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan in 1238, during the Mongol invasion of Europe (1220s–1240s)\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Pechenegs and the Cuman-Kipchaks, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.[117] Like many other parts of Eurasia, these territories were overrun by the Mongols.[118] The invaders, who became known as Tatars, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the Golden Horde with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion, and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries.[119][120] After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: Moldavia and Walachia. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans.[121] From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the Grand Duchy of Moscow grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480, and eventually becoming the Tsardom of Russia. The state was consolidated under Ivan III the Great and Ivan the Terrible, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.\n\n\nThe Great Famine of 1315–1317 was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages.[122] The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of France was reduced by half.[123][124] Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines,[125] and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period.[126] Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the Black Death, one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe alone—a third of the European population at the time.[127]\n\n\nThe plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in *The Decameron* (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased persecution of Jews, beggars and lepers.[128] The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century.[129] During this period, more than 100 plague epidemics swept across Europe.[130]\n\n\n\n### Early modern period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early modern period\n\nSee also: Renaissance, Reformation, Scientific Revolution, and Age of Discovery\n\n![](image)*The School of Athens* by Raphael (1511): Contemporaries, such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci (centre), are portrayed as classical scholars of the Renaissance.\nThe Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in Florence, and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical Greek and Arabic knowledge from monastic libraries, often translated from Arabic into Latin.[131][132][133] The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of art, philosophy, music, and the sciences, under the joint patronage of royalty, the nobility, the Roman Catholic Church and an emerging merchant class.[134][135][136] Patrons in Italy, including the Medici family of Florentine bankers and the Popes in Rome, funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci.[137][138]\n\n\nPolitical intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in Avignon and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.[139] In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Spain and Portugal, the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.[140][141] Exploration reached the Southern Hemisphere in the Atlantic and the Southern tip of Africa. Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492, and Vasco da Gama opened the ocean route to the East linking the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in 1498. The Portuguese-born explorer Ferdinand Magellan reached Asia westward across the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans in a Spanish expedition, resulting in the first circumnavigation of the globe, completed by the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano (1519–1522). Soon after, the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing large global empires in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania.[142] France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas and Asia. In 1588, a Spanish armada failed to invade England. A year later England tried unsuccessfully to invade Spain, allowing Philip II of Spain to maintain his dominant war capacity in Europe. This English disaster also allowed the Spanish fleet to retain its capability to wage war for the next decades. However, two more Spanish armadas failed to invade England (2nd Spanish Armada and 3rd Spanish Armada).[143][144][145][146]\n\n\n\n![](image)Habsburg dominions in the centuries following their partition by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The principal military base of Philip II in Europe was the Spanish road stretching from the Netherlands to the Duchy of Milan.[147]\nThe Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation in 1517 when German theologian Martin Luther nailed his *Ninety-five Theses* criticising the selling of indulgences to the church door. He was subsequently excommunicated in the papal bull *Exsurge Domine* in 1520 and his followers were condemned in the 1521 Diet of Worms, which divided German princes between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths.[148] Religious fighting and warfare spread with Protestantism.[149] The plunder of the empires of the Americas allowed Spain to finance religious persecution in Europe for over a century.[150] The Thirty Years War (1618–1648) crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.[151] In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, France rose to predominance within Europe.[152] The defeat of the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 marked the historic end of Ottoman expansion into Europe.[153]\n\n\nThe 17th century in Central and parts of Eastern Europe was a period of general decline;[154] the region experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700.[155] From the Union of Krewo (1385) east-central Europe was dominated by the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The hegemony of the vast Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had ended with the devastation brought by the Second Northern War (Deluge) and subsequent conflicts;[156] the state itself was partitioned and ceased to exist at the end of the 18th century.[157]\n\n\nFrom the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the Golden Horde were conquered by Russia, Tatars from the Crimean Khanate frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture slaves.[158] Further east, the Nogai Horde and Kazakh Khanate frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of contemporary Russia and Ukraine for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia).\n\n\nThe Renaissance and the New Monarchs marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention and scientific development.[159] Among the great figures of the Western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Isaac Newton.[160] According to Peter Barrett, \"It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world.\"[131]\n\n\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Modern history\n\nSee also: Industrial Revolution, French Revolution, and Age of Enlightenment\n\n![](image)The national boundaries within Europe set by the Congress of Vienna\nThe Seven Years' War brought to an end the \"Old System\" of alliances in Europe. Consequently, when the American Revolutionary War turned into a global war between 1778 and 1783, Britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of European powers, and lacking any substantial ally.[161]\n\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment was a powerful intellectual movement during the 18th century promoting scientific and reason-based thoughts.[162][163][164] Discontent with the aristocracy and clergy's monopoly on political power in France resulted in the French Revolution, and the establishment of the First Republic as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial reign of terror.[165] Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power in the aftermath of the French Revolution, and established the First French Empire that, during the Napoleonic Wars, grew to encompass large parts of Europe before collapsing in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo.[166][167] Napoleonic rule resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the French Revolution, including that of the nation state, as well as the widespread adoption of the French models of administration, law and education.[168][169][170] The Congress of Vienna, convened after Napoleon's downfall, established a new balance of power in Europe centred on the five \"Great Powers\": the UK, France, Prussia, Austria and Russia.[171] This balance would remain in place until the Revolutions of 1848, during which liberal uprisings affected all of Europe except for Russia and the UK. These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted.[172] The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed; 1871 saw the unifications of both Italy and Germany as nation-states from smaller principalities.[173]\n\n\nIn parallel, the Eastern Question grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the Great Powers struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The Russian Empire stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the Habsburg Empire and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the Serbian revolution (1804) and Greek War of Independence (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the Balkans, which ended with the Balkan Wars in 1912–1913.[174] Formal recognition of the *de facto* independent principalities of Montenegro, Serbia and Romania ensued at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.\n\n\n\n![](image)Marshall's Temple Works (1840); the Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain.\nThe Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe. The invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth, mass employment and the rise of a new working class.[175] Reforms in social and economic spheres followed, including the first laws on child labour, the legalisation of trade unions,[176] and the abolition of slavery.[177] In Britain, the Public Health Act of 1875 was passed, which significantly improved living conditions in many British cities.[178] Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.[179] The last major famine recorded in Western Europe, the Great Famine of Ireland, caused death and mass emigration of millions of Irish people.[180] In the 19th century, 70 million people left Europe in migrations to various European colonies abroad and to the United States.[181] The industrial revolution also led to large population growth, and the share of the world population living in Europe reached a peak of slightly above 25% around the year 1913.[182][183]\n\n\n\n### 20th century to the present[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Modern era and History of Europe\n\nSee also: World War I, Great Depression, Interwar period, Second World War, Cold War, and History of the European Union\n\n![](image)Map of European colonial empires throughout the world in 1914\nTwo world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. The First World War was fought between 1914 and 1918. It started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated by the Yugoslav nationalist[184] Gavrilo Princip.[185] Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the Entente Powers (France, Belgium, Serbia, Portugal, Russia, the United Kingdom, and later Italy, Greece, Romania, and the United States) and the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire). The war left more than 16 million civilians and military dead.[186] Over 60 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map depicting the military alliances of the First World War in 1914–1918\nRussia was plunged into the Russian Revolution, which threw down the Tsarist monarchy and replaced it with the communist Soviet Union,[188] leading also to the independence of many former Russian governorates, such as Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as new European countries.[189] Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.[190] Excess deaths in Russia over the course of the First World War and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million.[191] In 1932–1933, under Stalin's leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the second Soviet famine which caused millions of deaths;[192] surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour. Stalin was also responsible for the Great Purge of 1937–38 in which the NKVD executed 681,692 people;[193] millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Serbian war efforts (1914–1918) cost the country one quarter of its population.[195][196][197][198][199]\n![](image)Nazi Germany began the devastating Second World War in Europe by its leader, Adolf Hitler. Here Hitler, on the right, with his closest ally, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, in 1940.\nThe social revolutions sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following The Great War: in 1919, with the Weimar Republic in Germany and the First Austrian Republic; in 1922, with Mussolini's one-party fascist government in the Kingdom of Italy and in Atatürk's Turkish Republic, adopting the Western alphabet and state secularism.\nEconomic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This, and the Wall Street Crash of 1929, brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, fascist movements developed throughout Europe placing Adolf Hitler in power of what became Nazi Germany.[200][201]\n\n\nIn 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the Saarland and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria became a part of Germany following the Anschluss. Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, controlled by Germany and the Slovak Republic. At the time, the United Kingdom and France preferred a policy of appeasement.\n\n\nWith tensions mounting between Germany and Poland over the future of Danzig, the Germans turned to the Soviets and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the European Theatre of the Second World War.[202][203][204] The Soviet invasion of Poland started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the Baltic countries and, on 30 November, Finland, the latter of which was followed by the devastating Winter War for the Red Army.[205] The British hoped to land at Narvik and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The Phoney War continued.\n\n\nIn May 1940, Germany attacked France through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August, Germany had begun a bombing offensive against the United Kingdom but failed to convince the Britons to give up.[206] In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa.[207] On 7 December 1941 Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the British Empire, and other allied forces.[208][209]\n\n\n\n![](image)The \"Big Three\" at the Yalta Conference in 1945; seated (from the left): Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin\nAfter the staggering Battle of Stalingrad in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The Battle of Kursk, which involved the largest tank battle in history, was the last major German offensive on the Eastern Front. In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the D-Day landings, opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally fell in 1945, ending the Second World War in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with 60 million dead across the world.[210] More than 40 million people in Europe had died as a result of the Second World War,[211] including between 11 and 17 million people who perished during the Holocaust.[212] The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all Second World War casualties.[213] By the end of the Second World War, Europe had more than 40 million refugees.[214][215][216] Several post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20 million people.[217]\n\n\nThe First World War, and especially the Second World War, diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After the Second World War the map of Europe was redrawn at the Yalta Conference and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by Winston Churchill an \"Iron Curtain\". The United States and Western Europe established the NATO alliance and, later, the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the Warsaw Pact.[218] Particular hot spots after the Second World War were Berlin and Trieste, whereby the Free Territory of Trieste, founded in 1947 with the UN, was dissolved in 1954 and 1975, respectively. The Berlin blockade in 1948 and 1949 and the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 were one of the great international crises of the Cold War.[219][220][221]\n\n\nThe two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on nuclear proliferation. At the same time decolonisation, which had already started after the First World War, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Flag of Europe, adopted by the Council of Europe in 1955 as the flag for the whole of Europe[222]\nIn the 1980s the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Solidarity movement in Poland weakened the previously rigid communist system. The opening of the Iron Curtain at the Pan-European Picnic then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which the Eastern bloc, the Warsaw Pact and other communist states collapsed, and the Cold War ended.[223][224][225] Germany was reunited, after the symbolic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.[226] This made old previously interrupted cultural and economic relationships possible, and previously isolated cities such as Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Trieste were now again in the centre of Europe.[200][227][228][229]\n\n\nEuropean integration also grew after the Second World War. In 1949 the Council of Europe was founded, following a speech by Sir Winston Churchill, with the idea of unifying Europe[18] to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for Belarus, Russia,[230] and Vatican City. The Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the European Economic Community between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.[231] In 1967 the EEC, European Coal and Steel Community, and Euratom formed the European Community, which in 1993 became the European Union. The EU established a parliament, court and central bank, and introduced the euro as a unified currency.[232] Between 2004 and 2013, more Central European countries began joining, expanding the EU to 28 European countries and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.[233] However, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020, as a result of a June 2016 referendum on EU membership.[234] The Russo-Ukrainian conflict, which has been ongoing since 2014, steeply escalated when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, marking the largest humanitarian and refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War[235] and the Yugoslav Wars.[236]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Europe\n\n![](image)Map of populous Europe and surrounding regions showing physical, political and population characteristics, as per 2018\nEurope makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass.[28] It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.[237] Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas to the south.[238]\nLand relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps, Pyrenees and Carpathians, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain and at its heart lies the North German Plain. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.\n\n\nThis description is simplified. Subregions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean that is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Europe\n\n![](image)Biomes of Europe and surrounding regions:   \n      tundra      alpine tundra      taiga      montane forest   \n      temperate broadleaf forest      mediterranean forest      temperate steppe      dry steppe\nEurope lies mainly in the temperate climate zone of the northern hemisphere, where the prevailing wind direction is from the west. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream, an ocean current which carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico across the Atlantic ocean to Europe.[239] The Gulf Stream is nicknamed \"Europe's central heating\", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\nTherefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Aveiro is 16 °C (61 °F), while it is only 13 °C (55 °F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude, bordering the same ocean. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in far south-eastern Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8 °C (14 °F) higher than those in Calgary and they are almost 22 °C (40 °F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.[239]\n\n\nThe large water masses of the Mediterranean Sea, which equalise the temperatures on an annual and daily average, are also of particular importance. The water of the Mediterranean extends from the Sahara desert to the Alpine arc in its northernmost part of the Adriatic Sea near Trieste.[240]\n\n\nIn general, Europe is not just colder towards the north compared to the south, but it also gets colder from the west towards the east. The climate is more oceanic in the west and less so in the east. This can be illustrated by the following table of average temperatures at locations roughly following the 64th, 60th, 55th, 50th, 45th and 40th latitudes. None of them is located at high altitude; most of them are close to the sea.

Around 1.1 billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the Laurentia block) became joined to Rodinia, later resplitting around 550 million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440 million years ago Euramerica was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with Gondwana then leading to the formation of Pangea. Around 190 million years ago, Gondwana and Laurasia split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via Greenland, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50 million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late Tertiary period about five million years ago.[243]\n\n\nThe geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the Scottish Highlands to the rolling plains of Hungary.[244] Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous Southern Europe and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and Alps/Carpathians. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the Scandinavian Mountains and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the Celtic Sea, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea complex and Barents Sea.\n\n\nThe northern plain contains the old geological continent of Baltica and so may be regarded geologically as the \"main continent\", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent Avalonia.\n\n\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green) and tundra, or bogs, in the north (dark yellow)\nHaving lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of humans. With the exception of Fennoscandia and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various national parks.\n\n\nThe main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed forest. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift warm the continent. Southern Europe has a warm but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these, such as the Alps and the Pyrenees, are oriented east–west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south–north (Scandinavian Mountains, Dinarides, Carpathians, Apennines) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time, and the cutting down of the preagricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.\n\n\n\n![](image)Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch\nPossibly 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.[245] It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation, Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the broadleaf and mixed forests, taiga of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed rainforests of the Caucasus and the Cork oak forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, while in its Western Russia its 5–10%. The European country with the smallest percentage of forested area is Iceland (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).[246]\n\n\nIn temperate Europe, mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are beech and oak. In the north, the taiga is a mixed spruce–pine–birch forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to tundra as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many olive trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; Mediterranean Cypress is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east–west tongue of Eurasian grassland (the steppe) extends westwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.\n\n\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fauna of Europe\n\n![](image)Biogeographic regions of Europe and bordering regions\nGlaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of humans affected the distribution of European fauna. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction. The woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the Neolithic period. Today wolves (carnivores) and bears (omnivores) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the Middle Ages the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula, Scandinavia and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, polar bears may be found on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The wolf, the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of Western Europe (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).\n\n\n\n![](image)Once roaming the great temperate forests of Eurasia, European bison now live in nature preserves in Białowieża Forest, on the border between Poland and Belarus.[247][248]\nOther carnivores include the European wildcat, red fox and arctic fox, the golden jackal, different species of martens, the European hedgehog, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, as well as different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).\n\n\nImportant European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the small tortoiseshell butterfly, add to the biodiversity.[249]\n\n\nSea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly phytoplankton. Important animals that live in European seas are zooplankton, molluscs, echinoderms, different crustaceans, squids and octopuses, fish, dolphins and whales.\n\n\nBiodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's Bern Convention, which has also been signed by the European Community as well as non-European states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Europe\n\nSee also: List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe, International organisations in Europe, Regions of Europe, and European integration\n\n![](image)\nA clickable Euler diagram[file] showing the relationships between various multinational European organisations and agreements * v\n* t\n* e\n\nThe political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is parliamentary democracy, in most cases in the form of Republic; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the Monarchy. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies[250] are constitutional.\n\n\nEuropean integration is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the Council of Europe since the end of the Second World War. The European Union has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the Eurasian Economic Union has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.\n\n\n27 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free Schengen Area and 20 of the monetary union Eurozone. Among the smaller European organisations are the Nordic Council, the Benelux, the Baltic Assembly and the Visegrád Group.\n\n\n\n## List of states and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of

Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as the Canary Islands and Heligoland, are also not included for this reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Symbol | Flag | Name\n | Sovereignstate\n | Area(km2)\n | Population | Populationdensity(per km2)\n | Capital |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Åland](image) | ![Åland](image) | Åland | Finland\n | 1,580\n | 29,489\n | 18.36\n | Mariehamn |\n| ![Bailiwick of Guernsey](image) | ![](image) | Bailiwick of Guernsey[c] | UK\n | 78\n | 65,849\n | 844.0\n | St. Peter Port |\n| ![Jersey](image) | ![Jersey](image) | Bailiwick of Jersey[c] | UK\n | 118.2\n | 100,080\n | 819\n | Saint Helier |\n| ![Faroe Islands](image) | ![Faroe Islands](image) | Faroe Islands | Denmark\n | 1,399\n | 50,778\n | 35.2\n | Tórshavn |\n| ![Gibraltar](image) | ![Gibraltar](image) | Gibraltar | UK\n | 6.7\n | 32,194\n | 4,328\n | Gibraltar |\n| ![Greenland](image) | ![Greenland](image) | Greenland | Denmark[r] | 2,166,086\n | 55,877\n | 0.028\n | Nuuk |\n| ![Isle of Man](image) | ![Isle of Man](image) | Isle of Man[c] | UK\n | 572\n | 83,314\n | 148\n | Douglas |\n|  | ![Svalbard](image) | Svalbard | Norway\n | 61,022\n | 2,667\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Europe, List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal), and List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (PPP)\n\n![](image)GDP (PPP) per capita of European countries in 2021\n \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|      >$60,000  |      $50,000 – $60,000  |\n|      $40,000 – $50,000  |      $30,000 – $40,000  |\n|      $20,000 – $30,000  |      $10,000 – $20,000 |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nAs a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7 trillion compared to North America's $27.1 trillion in 2008.[251] In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.[252] As with other continents, Europe has a large wealth gap among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the Northwest and West in general, followed by Central Europe, while most economies of Eastern and Southeastern Europe are still reemerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\n\nThe model of the Blue Banana was designed as an economic geographic representation of the respective economic power of the regions, which was further developed into the Golden Banana or Blue Star. The trade between East and West, as well as towards Asia, which had been disrupted for a long time by the two world wars, new borders and the Cold War, increased sharply after 1989. In addition, there is new impetus from the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative across the Suez Canal towards Africa and Asia.[253]\n\n\nThe European Union, a political entity composed of 27 European states, comprises the largest single economic area in the world. Nineteen EU countries share the euro as a common currency.\nFive European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest national economies in GDP (PPP). This includes (ranks according to the CIA): Germany (6), Russia (7), the United Kingdom (10), France (11) and Italy (13).[254]\n\n\nSome European countries are much richer than others. The richest in terms of nominal GDP is Monaco with its US$185,829 per capita (2018) and the poorest is Ukraine with its US$3,659 per capita (2019).[255]\n\n\nAs a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.[256]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (nominal, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *![](image) European Union*[257] | 19,226,235 | 2008\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Germany | 4,429,838 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) United Kingdom | 3,332,059 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) France | 3,049,016 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Italy[258] | 2,408,655 | 2008\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Russia | 2,288,428 | 2013\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Spain[259] | 1,631,863 | 2008\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Turkey | 1,154,600 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Netherlands | 1,092,748 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)  Switzerland | 905,684 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Poland | 842,172 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (PPP, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *![](image) European Union*[260] | 25,430,409 | 2023\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Germany | 5,537,992 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Russia[261] | 5,326,855 | 2022\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) United Kingdom | 3,871,790 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) France | 3,868,619 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Turkey | 3,613,540 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Italy | 3,193,180 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Spain | 2,413,066 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Poland | 1,712,629 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Netherlands | 1,297,024 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Romania | 794,055 | 2022\n |\n\n\n\n### Economic history[edit]\n\n\nIndustrial growth (1760–1945)\nCapitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.[262] From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.[263] The Industrial Revolution started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,[264] and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by the First World War, but by the beginning of the Second World War, they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. The Second World War, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.\n\n\n\nCold War (1945–1991)\n![](image)Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989\n![](image)Eurozone (blue colour)\nAfter the Second World War the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,[265] and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.[266] Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.[267] France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of Franco, also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the Spanish miracle.[268] The majority of Central and Eastern European states came under the control of the Soviet Union and thus were members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON).[269]\n\n\nThe states which retained a free-market system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the Marshall Plan.[270] The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the Cold War. Until 1990, the European Community was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.\n\n\n\nReunification (1991–present)\n![](image)One of Kosovo's main economical sources is mining, because it has large reserves of lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron and bauxite.[271] Miners at the Trepča Mines in Mitrovica, Kosovo in 2011.\nWith the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states underwent shock therapy measures to liberalise their economies and implement free market reforms.\n\n\nAfter East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany, while the latter experienced sudden mass unemployment and plummeting of industrial production.\n\n\nBy the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe, comprising the five largest European economies of the time: Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the Eurozone, replacing their national currencies by the euro.\n\n\nFigures released by Eurostat in 2009 confirmed that the Eurozone had gone into recession in 2008.[272] It impacted much of the region.[273] In 2010, fears of a sovereign debt crisis[274] developed concerning some countries in Europe, especially Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal.[275] As a result, measures were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone.[276] The EU-27 unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2012.[277] For those aged 15–24 it was 22.4%.[277]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Europe\n\nSee also: List of European countries by population, List of European countries by life expectancy, and Ageing of Europe\n\n![](image)Population growth in and around Europe in 2021[278]\nThe population of Europe was about 742 million in 2023 according to UN estimates.[2][3] This is slightly more than one ninth of the world's population.[c] The population density of Europe (the number of people per area) is the second highest of any continent, behind Asia. The population of Europe is currently slowly decreasing, by about 0.2% per year,[279] because there are fewer births than deaths. This natural decrease in population is reduced by the fact that more people migrate to Europe from other continents than vice versa.\n\n\nSouthern Europe and Western Europe are the regions with the highest average number of elderly people in the world, today they comprise 21% of the population, with over 65 years.[280] Projections suggest that by 2050 Europe will reach 30%.[281] This is caused by the fact that the population has been having children below replacement level since the 1970s. The United Nations predicts that Europe will decline its population between 2022 and 2050 by −7 per cent, without changing immigration movements.[282]\n\n\nAccording to a population projection of the UN Population Division, Europe's population may fall to between 680 and 720 million people by 2050, which would be 7% of the world population at that time.[283] Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to fertility rates. The average number of children per female of child-bearing age is 1.52, far below the replacement rate.[284] The UN predicts a steady population decline in Central and Eastern Europe as a result of emigration and low birth rates.[285]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Europe\n\nFurther information: Genetic history of Europe\n\nPan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \"peoples of Europe\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities.[286]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Immigration to Europe and European diaspora\n\n![](image)Map showing areas of European settlement (people who claim full European descent)\nEurope is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at nearly 87 million people in 2020, according to the International Organisation for Migration.[287] In 2005, the EU had an overall net gain from immigration of 1.8 million people. This accounted for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth.[288] In 2021, 827,000 persons were given citizenship of an EU member state, an increase of about 14% compared with 2020.[289] 2.3 million immigrants from non-EU countries entered the EU in 2021.[289]\n\n\nEarly modern emigration from Europe began with Spanish and Portuguese settlers in the 16th century,[290][291] and French and English settlers in the 17th century.[292] But numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the 19th century, when millions of poor families left Europe.[293]\n\n\nToday, large populations of European descent are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Brazil, while most of the other Latin American countries also have a considerable population of European origins). Australia and New Zealand have large European-derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of Cape Verde and probably São Tomé and Príncipe, depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the White South Africans in South Africa. In Asia, European-derived populations, (specifically Russians), predominate in North Asia and some parts of Northern Kazakhstan.[294]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Europe\n\n![](image)Distribution of major languages of EuropeSee also: List of European languages by number of speakers\n\nEurope has about 225 indigenous languages,[295] mostly falling within three Indo-European language groups: the Romance languages, derived from the Latin of the Roman Empire; the Germanic languages, whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the Slavic languages.[243] Slavic languages are mostly spoken in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in Western and Southern Europe, as well as in Switzerland in Central Europe and Romania and Moldova in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Western, Northern and Central Europe as well as in Gibraltar and Malta in Southern Europe.[243] Languages in adjacent areas show significant overlaps (such as in English, for example). Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the Baltic group (Latvian and Lithuanian), the Celtic group (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish and Breton[243]), Greek, Armenian and Albanian.\n\n\nA distinct non-Indo-European family of Uralic languages (Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Erzya, Komi, Mari, Moksha and Udmurt) is spoken mainly in Estonia, Finland, Hungary and parts of Russia. Turkic languages include Azerbaijani, Kazakh and Turkish, in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe (Balkan Gagauz Turkish, Bashkir, Chuvash, Crimean Tatar, Karachay-Balkar, Kumyk, Nogai and Tatar). Kartvelian languages (Georgian, Mingrelian and Svan) are spoken primarily in Georgia. Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed Northeast Caucasian, most notably including Chechen, Avar and Lezgin; and Northwest Caucasian, most notably including Adyghe). Maltese is the only Semitic language that is official within the EU, while Basque is the only European language isolate.\n\n\nMultilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Europe\n\nReligion in Europe according to the *Global Religious Landscape* survey by the Pew Forum, 2016[8]\n\n\n\nChristianity (76.2%)\nNo religion (18.3%)\nIslam (4.9%)\nBuddhism (0.2%)\nHinduism (0.2%)\nFolk religion (0.1%)\nOther religions (0.1%)\n\nThe largest religion in Europe is Christianity, with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves Christians,[296][297] including Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and various Protestant denominations. Among Protestants, the most popular are Lutheranism, Anglicanism and the Reformed faith. Smaller Protestant denominations include Anabaptists as well as denominations centered in the United States such as Pentecostalism, Methodism, and Evangelicalism. Although Christianity originated in the Middle East, its centre of mass shifted to Europe when it became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the late 4th century. Christianity played a prominent role in the development of the European culture and identity.[298][299][300] Today, a bit over 25% of the world's Christians live in Europe.[301]\n\n\nIslam is the second most popular religion in Europe. Over 25 million, or roughly 5% of the population, adhere to it.[302] In Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, two countries in the Balkan peninsula in Southeastern Europe, Islam instead of Christianity is the majority religion. This is of also the case in Turkey and in certain parts of Russia, as well as in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, all of which are at the border to Asia.[302] Many countries in Europe are home to a sizeable Muslim minority, and immigration to Europe has increased the number of Muslim people in Europe in recent years.\n\n\nThe Jewish population in Europe was about 1.4 million people in 2020 (about 0.2% of the population).[303] There is a long history of Jewish life in Europe, beginning in antiquity. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Russian Empire had the majority of the world's Jews living within its borders.[304] In 1897, according to Russian census of 1897, the total Jewish population of Russia was 5.1 million people, which was 4.13% of total population. Of this total, the vast majority lived within the Pale of Settlement.[305] In 1933, there were about 9.5 million Jewish people in Europe, representing 1.7% of the population,[306] but most were killed or displaced across Europe during The Holocaust.[307][303] In the 21st century, France has the largest Jewish population in Europe, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia.[8]\n\n\nOther religions practiced in Europe include Hinduism and Buddhism, are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's Republic of Kalmykia).\n\n\nA large and increasing number people in Europe are irreligious, atheist and agnostic. They are estimated to make up about 18.3% of Europe's population currently.[8]\n\n\n\n### Major cities and urban areas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of European cities by population within city limits\n\nThe three largest urban areas of Europe are Moscow, London and Paris. All have over 10 million residents,[308] and as such have been described as megacities.[309] While Istanbul has the highest total city population, it lies partly in Asia. 64.9% of the residents live on the European side and 35.1% on the Asian side.\nThe next largest cities in order of population are Madrid, Saint Petersburg, Milan, Barcelona, Berlin, and Rome each having over three million residents.[308]\n\n\nWhen considering the commuter belts or metropolitan areas, within Europe (for which comparable data is available) Moscow covers the largest population, followed in order by Istanbul, London, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Ruhr Area, Saint Petersburg, Rhein-Süd, Barcelona and Berlin.[310]\n\n\n\nEuropean megacities\n![Moscow International Business Center](image)\nMoscow\n![City of London](image)\nLondon\n![](image)\nParis\n![Levent](image)\nIstanbul[b]\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Europe\n\nFurther information: European folklore and European art\n\n![](image)Map purportedly displaying the European continent split along cultural and state borders as proposed by the German organisation Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen [] (StAGN)\n\"Europe\" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of ancient Greece and the Roman Empire and its cultures. The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of Christendom (or more specifically Latin Christendom), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially against Islam, as in the Reconquista and the Ottoman wars in Europe.[311]\n\n\nThis shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into Slavic, Latin (Romance) and Germanic, but with several components not part of either of these group (notably Greek, Basque and Celtic). Historically, special examples with overlapping cultures are Strasbourg with Latin (Romance) and Germanic or Trieste with Latin, Slavic and Germanic roots.\nCultural contacts and mixtures shape a large part of the regional cultures of Europe. Europe is often described as \"maximum cultural diversity with minimal geographical distances\".\n\n\nDifferent cultural events are organised in Europe, with the aim of bringing different cultures closer together and raising awareness of their importance, such as the European Capital of Culture, the European Region of Gastronomy, the European Youth Capital and the European Capital of Sport.\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Sport in Europe.[edit]\n![](image)Football is by far the most popular sport in Europe. This picture shows Camp Nou in Barcelona before the 2023 renovation works started.\nSport in Europe tends to be highly organized with many sports having professional leagues.\n\n\n\nThe origins of many of the world's most popular sports today lie in the codification of many traditional games, especially in the United Kingdom. However, a paradoxical feature of European sport is the extent to which local, regional and national variations continue to exist, and even in some instances to predominate.[312]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n\n\nMain articles: List of Europe-related articles and Outline of Europe\n\nHistory\n* Baltica\n* Genetic history of Europe\n* Prehistoric Europe\n* Classical antiquity\n* Middle Ages\n* Early modern Europe\n* Modernity\n* History of Europe\n\n\nPolitics\n* Eurodistrict\n* Euroregion\n* Flags of Europe\n* List of sovereign states by date of formation\n* Names of European cities in different languages\n* OSCE countries statistics\n* European Union as a potential superpower\n\n\nDemographics\n* Area and population of European countries\n* Demographics of Europe\n* European Union statistics\n* List of European cities by population within city limits\n* List of urban areas in the European Union\n* List of cities in Europe\n* List of metropolitan areas in Europe\n* List of villages in Europe\n* Pan-European identity\n\n\nEconomics\n* Economy of the European Union\n* Financial and social rankings of European countries\n* Healthcare in Europe\n* Telecommunications in Europe\n* List of European television stations\n* List of European countries by GDP (nominal)\n\n\nCulture\n* European Capital of Culture\n* European Region of Gastronomy\n* European Youth Capital\n\n\nSports\n* European Games\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Europe is normally considered its own continent in the English-speaking world, which uses the seven continent model.[10][11] Other models consider Europe as part of a Eurasian or Afro-Eurasian continent.

It shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Africa and Asia. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea and the waterways of the Turkish straits.[14]\n\n\nEurope covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 745 million (about 10% of the world population) in 2021; the third-largest after Asia and Africa.[2][3] The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.\n\n\nEuropean culture is the root of Western civilisation, which traces its lineage back to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.[15][16] The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and the related Migration Period marked the end of Europe's ancient history, and the beginning of the Middle Ages. The Italian Renaissance began in Florence and spread to the rest of the continent, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, exploration, art, and science which contributed to the beginning of the modern era. Since the Age of Discovery, led by Spain and Portugal, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs with multiple explorations and conquests around the world.\nBetween the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers colonised at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania, and the majority of Asia.\n\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in Western Europe and eventually the wider world. Both world wars began and were fought to a great extent in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence.[17] During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East, until the Revolutions of 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) and the Council of Europe are two important international organisations aiming to represent the European continent on a political level. The Council of Europe was founded in 1948 with the idea of unifying Europe[18] to achieve common goals and prevent future wars. Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union, a separate supranational political entity based on a system of European law that lies between a confederation and a federation.[19] The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. A majority of its members have adopted a common currency, the euro, and participate in the European single market and a customs union. A large bloc of countries, the Schengen Area, have also abolished internal border and immigration controls. Regular popular elections take place every five years within the EU; they are considered to be the second largest democratic elections in the world after India's.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information: Europa (consort of Zeus)\n\n![](image)First map of the world according to Anaximander (6th century BCE)\nIn classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient Greek: Εὐρώπη, *Eurṓpē*) was a Phoenician princess. One view is that her name derives from the Ancient Greek elements εὐρύς (*eurús*) 'wide, broad', and ὤψ (*ōps*, gen. ὠπός, *ōpós*) 'eye, face, countenance', hence their composite *Eurṓpē* would mean 'wide-gazing' or 'broad of aspect'.[20][21][22][23] *Broad* has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion and the poetry devoted to it.[20] An alternative view is that of Robert Beekes, who has argued in favour of a Pre-Indo-European origin for the name, explaining that a derivation from *eurus* would yield a different toponym than Europa. Beekes has located toponyms related to that of Europa in the territory of ancient Greece, and localities such as that of Europos in ancient Macedonia.[24]\n\n\nThere have been attempts to connect *Eurṓpē* to a Semitic term for *west*, this being either Akkadian *erebu* meaning 'to go down, set' (said of the sun) or Phoenician *'ereb* 'evening, west',[25] which is at the origin of Arabic *maghreb* and Hebrew *ma'arav*. Martin Litchfield West stated that \"phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor\",[26] while Beekes considers a connection to Semitic languages improbable.[24]\n\n\nMost major world languages use words derived from *Eurṓpē* or *Europa* to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word *Ōuzhōu* (歐洲/欧洲), which is an abbreviation of the transliterated name *Ōuluóbā zhōu* (歐羅巴洲) (*zhōu* means \"continent\"); a similar Chinese-derived term *Ōshū* (欧州) is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, *Ōshū Rengō* (欧州連合), despite the katakana *Yōroppa* (ヨーロッパ) being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages, the originally Persian name *Frangistan* ('land of the Franks') is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as *Avrupa* or *Evropa*.[27]\n\n\n\n## Definition[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Boundaries between the continents of Earth § Asia and Europe\n\nSee also: List of transcontinental countries\n\n### Contemporary definition[edit]\n\n\nClickable map of Europe, showing one of the most commonly used continental boundaries[b]   \n**Key:** **blue**: states which straddle the border between Europe and Asia;\n**green**: countries not geographically in Europe, but closely associated with the continent\n\n![](image)\nAlb.\n\nAndorra\n\nAustria\n\nAzer.\n\nBelarus\n\nBelg.\n\nBosnia\n\nBulgaria\n\n*Channel  \nIs.*\n\nCroatia\n\nCzech  \nRep.\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\n*Gib.

Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to Anatolia (or Asia Minor), but is considered part of Europe politically and it is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of North-western Africa for centuries, but now it is considered to be part of Europe as well.[29] \"Europe\", as used specifically in British English, may also refer to Continental Europe exclusively.[30]\n\n\nThe term \"continent\" usually implies the physical geography of a large land mass completely or almost completely surrounded by water at its borders. Prior to the adoption of the current convention that includes mountain divides, the border between Europe and Asia had been redefined several times since its first conception in classical antiquity, but always as a series of rivers, seas and straits that were believed to extend an unknown distance east and north from the Mediterranean Sea without the inclusion of any mountain ranges. Cartographer Herman Moll suggested in 1715 Europe was bounded by a series of partly-joined waterways directed towards the Turkish straits, and the Irtysh River draining into the upper part of the Ob River and the Arctic Ocean. In contrast, the present eastern boundary of Europe partially adheres to the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, which is somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent compared to any clear-cut definition of the term \"continent\".\n\n\nThe current division of Eurasia into two continents now reflects East-West cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The geographic border between Europe and Asia does not follow any state boundaries and now only follows a few bodies of water. Turkey is generally considered a transcontinental country divided entirely by water, while Russia and Kazakhstan are only partly divided by waterways. France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain are also transcontinental (or more properly, intercontinental, when oceans or large seas are involved) in that their main land areas are in Europe while pockets of their territories are located on other continents separated from Europe by large bodies of water. Spain, for example, has territories south of the Mediterranean Sea—namely, Ceuta and Melilla—which are parts of Africa and share a border with Morocco. According to the current convention, Georgia and Azerbaijan are transcontinental countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains as the divide between continents.\n\n\n\n### History of the concept[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boundary between Europe and Asia\n\n#### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Depiction of *Europa regina* ('Queen Europe') in 1582\nThe first recorded usage of *Eurṓpē* as a geographic term is in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BCE by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni River on the territory of Georgia) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE.[31] Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts—Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa)—with the Nile and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.[32] Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don.[33] The *Book of Jubilees* described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from Northwest Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.[34]\n\n\nThe convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used by Roman-era authors such as Posidonius,[35] Strabo[36] and Ptolemy,[37] who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.\n\n\nThe Roman Empire did not attach a strong identity to the concept of continental divisions. However, following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the culture that developed in its place, linked to Latin and the Catholic church, began to associate itself with the concept of \"Europe\".[38] The term \"Europe\" is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church, as opposed to both the Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world.\n\n\nA cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam, and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.[39][40] The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance: *Europa* often[*dubious – discuss*] figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin.[41] The transition of Europe to being a cultural term as well as a geographic one led to the borders of Europe being affected by cultural considerations in the East, especially relating to areas under Byzantine, Ottoman, and Russian influence. Such questions were affected by the positive connotations associated with the term Europe by its users. Such cultural considerations were not applied to the Americas, despite their conquest and settlement by European states. Instead, the concept of \"Western civilization\" emerged as a way of grouping together Europe and these colonies.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Modern definitions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Regions of Europe and Continental Europe\n\n![](image)*A New Map of Europe According to the Newest Observations* (1721) by Hermann Moll draws the eastern boundary of Europe along the Don River flowing south-west and the Tobol, Irtysh and Ob rivers flowing north.\n![](image)1916 political map of Europe showing most of Moll's waterways replaced by von Strahlenberg's Ural Mountains and Freshfield's Caucasus Crest, land features of a type that normally defines a subcontinent\nThe question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of Muscovy began to include North Asia. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of Eurasia into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the Turkish Straits, the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and the Don (ancient Tanais). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at Kalach-na-Donu (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the Volga–Don Canal), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.\n\n\nAround 1715, Herman Moll produced a map showing the northern part of the Ob River and the Irtysh River, a major tributary of the Ob, as components of a series of partly-joined waterways taking the boundary between Europe and Asia from the Turkish Straits, and the Don River all the way to the Arctic Ocean. In 1721, he produced a more up to date map that was easier to read. However, his proposal to adhere to major rivers as the line of demarcation was never taken up by other geographers who were beginning to move away from the idea of water boundaries as the only legitimate divides between Europe and Asia.\n\n\nFour years later, in 1725, Philip Johan von Strahlenberg was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary. He drew a new line along the Volga, following the Volga north until the Samara Bend, along Obshchy Syrt (the drainage divide between the Volga and Ural Rivers), then north and east along the latter waterway to its source in the Ural Mountains. At this point he proposed that mountain ranges could be included as boundaries between continents as alternatives to nearby waterways. Accordingly, he drew the new boundary north along Ural Mountains rather than the nearby and parallel running Ob and Irtysh rivers.[43] This was endorsed by the Russian Empire and introduced the convention that would eventually become commonly accepted. However, this did not come without criticism. Voltaire, writing in 1760 about Peter the Great's efforts to make Russia more European, ignored the whole boundary question with his claim that neither Russia, Scandinavia, northern Germany, nor Poland were fully part of Europe.[38] Since then, many modern analytical geographers like Halford Mackinder have declared that they see little validity in the Ural Mountains as a boundary between continents.[44]\n\n\nThe mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The 1745 atlas published by the Russian Academy of Sciences has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as Serafimovich before cutting north towards Arkhangelsk, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as John Cary followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the Kuma–Manych Depression was identified c. 1773 by a German naturalist, Peter Simon Pallas, as a valley that once connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,[45][46] and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.\n\n\nBy the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the Volga–Don Canal and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the Greater Caucasus watershed to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a \"controversy\" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with Douglas Freshfield advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the \"best possible\", citing support from various \"modern geographers\".[47]\n\n\nIn Russia and the Soviet Union, the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.[48] In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from Baydaratskaya Bay, on the Kara Sea, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the Ural River until the Mugodzhar Hills, and then the Emba River; and Kuma–Manych Depression,[49] thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.[50] However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest,[51] and this became the common convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.\n\n\nSome view the separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism: \"In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].\"[52]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Europe\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Europe\n\n![](image)Last Glacial Maximum refugia, c. 20,000 years ago  \n Solutrean culture\n Epigravettian culture[53]\n\n![](image)Paleolithic cave paintings from Lascaux in France (c. 15,000 BCE)\n![](image)Stonehenge in the United Kingdom (Late Neolithic from 3000 to 2000 BCE)\nDuring the 2.5 million years of the Pleistocene, numerous cold phases called glacials (Quaternary ice age), or significant advances of continental ice sheets, in Europe and North America, occurred at intervals of approximately 40,000 to 100,000 years. The long glacial periods were separated by more temperate and shorter interglacials which lasted about 10,000–15,000 years. The last cold episode of the last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago.[54] Earth is currently in an interglacial period of the Quaternary, called the Holocene.[55]\n\n\n*Homo erectus georgicus*, which lived roughly 1.8 million years ago in Georgia, is the earliest hominin to have been discovered in Europe.[56] Other hominin remains, dating back roughly 1 million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca, Spain.[57] Neanderthal man (named after the Neandertal valley in Germany) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago (115,000 years ago it is found already in the territory of present-day Poland[58]) and disappeared from the fossil record about 40,000 years ago,[59] with their final refuge being the Iberian Peninsula. The Neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans (Cro-Magnons), who appeared in Europe around 43,000 to 40,000 years ago.[60] Homo sapiens arrived in Europe around 54,000 years ago, some 10,000 years earlier than previously thought.[61] The earliest sites in Europe dated 48,000 years ago are Riparo Mochi (Italy), Geissenklösterle (Germany) and Isturitz (France).[62][63]\n\n\nThe European Neolithic period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BCE in Greece and the Balkans, probably influenced by earlier farming practices in Anatolia and the Near East.[64] It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the Danube and the Rhine (Linear Pottery culture), and along the Mediterranean coast (Cardial culture). Between 4500 and 3000 BCE, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artifacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as causewayed enclosures, burial mounds and megalithic tombs.[65] The Corded Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic. During this period giant megalithic monuments, such as the Megalithic Temples of Malta and Stonehenge, were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe.[66][67]\n\n\nThe modern native populations of Europe largely descend from three distinct lineages:[68] Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from populations associated with the Paleolithic Epigravettian culture;[53] Neolithic Early European Farmers who migrated from Anatolia during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago;[69] and Yamnaya Steppe herders who expanded into Europe from the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Ukraine and southern Russia in the context of Indo-European migrations 5,000 years ago.[68][70] The European Bronze Age began c. 3200 BCE in Greece with the Minoan civilisation on Crete, the first advanced civilisation in Europe.[71] The Minoans were followed by the Myceneans, who collapsed suddenly around 1200 BCE, ushering the European Iron Age.[72] Iron Age colonisation by the Greeks and Phoenicians gave rise to early Mediterranean cities. Early Iron Age Italy and Greece from around the 8th century BCE gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity, whose beginning is sometimes dated to 776 BCE, the year of the first Olympic Games.[73]\n\n\n\n### Classical antiquity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Classical antiquity\n\nSee also: Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome\n\n![](image)The Parthenon in Athens (432 BCE)\nAncient Greece was the founding culture of Western civilisation. Western democratic and rationalist culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece.[74] The Greek city-state, the polis, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece.[74] In 508 BCE, Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in Athens.[75] The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy, humanism and rationalism under Aristotle, Socrates and Plato; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer;[76] in drama with Sophocles and Euripides, in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen; and in science with Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes.[77][78][79] In the course of the 5th century BCE, several of the Greek city states would ultimately check the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars, considered a pivotal moment in world history,[80] as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilisation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Animation showing the growth and division of Ancient Rome (years CE)\nGreece was followed by Rome, which left its mark on law, politics, language, engineering, architecture, government and many more key aspects in western civilisation.[74] By 200 BCE, Rome had conquered Italy and over the following two centuries it conquered Greece and Hispania (Spain and Portugal), the North African coast, much of the Middle East, Gaul (France and Belgium) and Britannia (England and Wales).\n\n\nExpanding from their base in central Italy beginning in the third century BCE, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean Basin and Western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The Roman Republic ended in 27 BCE, when Augustus proclaimed the Roman Empire. The two centuries that followed are known as the *pax romana*, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity and political stability in most of Europe.[81] The empire continued to expand under emperors such as Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting Germanic, Pictish and Scottish tribes.[82][83] Christianity was legalised by Constantine I in 313 CE after three centuries of imperial persecution. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul) which was renamed Constantinople in his honour in 330 CE. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 CE and in 391–392 CE, the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions.[84] This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE; the closure of the pagan Platonic Academy of Athens in 529 CE;[85] or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century CE. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was one of the most powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in Europe.[86]\n\n\n\n### Early Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages\n\nSee also: Dark Ages and Age of Migrations\n\n![](image)\nEurope c. 650\n![](image)\nCharlemagne's empire in 814:      Francia,      Tributaries\n\nDuring the decline of the Roman Empire, Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the \"Age of Migrations\". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Slavs, Avars, Bulgars and, later on, the Vikings, Pechenegs, Cumans and Magyars.[81] Renaissance thinkers such as Petrarch would later refer to this as the \"Dark Ages\".[87]\n\n\nIsolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe, though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.[88]\n\n\nWhile the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural and military force in Europe. Emperor Justinian I presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a legal code that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the Hagia Sophia and brought the Christian church under state control.[89]\n\n\nFrom the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring Sasanid Persians were severely weakened due to the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent Byzantine–Sasanian wars, the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into Asia Minor. In the mid-7th century, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region.[90] Over the next centuries Muslim forces took Cyprus, Malta, Crete, Sicily and parts of southern Italy.[91] Between 711 and 720, most of the lands of the Visigothic Kingdom of Iberia was brought under Muslim rule—save for small areas in the north-west (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. This territory, under the Arabic name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad Caliphate. The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, which ended their northward advance. In the remote regions of north-western Iberia and the middle Pyrenees the power of the Muslims in the south was scarcely felt. It was here that the foundations of the Christian kingdoms of Asturias, Leon and Galicia were laid and from where the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula would start. However, no coordinated attempt would be made to drive the Moors out. The Christian kingdoms were mainly focused on their own internal power struggles. As a result, the Reconquista took the greater part of eight hundred years, in which period a long list of Alfonsos, Sanchos, Ordoños, Ramiros, Fernandos and Bermudos would be fighting their Christian rivals as much as the Muslim invaders.\n\n\n\n![](image)Viking raids and division of the Frankish Empire at the Treaty of Verdun in 843\nDuring the Dark Ages, the Western Roman Empire fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe, respectively.[92] Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under Clovis I.[93] Charlemagne, a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed \"Holy Roman Emperor\" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.[94]\n\n\nEast Central Europe saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (c. 1000 CE). The powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and causing a series of armed conflicts with East Francia. Further south, the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted Christianity: the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire) and the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia). To the East, Kievan Rus' expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the religion of state.[95][96] Further East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.[97]\n\n\n\n### High and Late Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, and Middle Ages\n\nSee also: Medieval demography\n\n![](image)The maritime republics of medieval Italy reestablished contacts between Europe, Asia and Africa with extensive trade networks and colonies across the Mediterranean, and had an essential role in the Crusades.[98][99]\nThe period between the year 1000 and 1250 is known as the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages until c. 1500.\n\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the Renaissance of the 12th century. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the Maritime Republics a leading role in the European scene.\n\n\nThe Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. Feudalism developed in France in the Early Middle Ages, and soon spread throughout Europe.[100] A struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the *Magna Carta* and the establishment of a parliament.[101] The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman Catholic Church. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tancred of Sicily and Philip II of France, during the Third Crusade (1189–1192)\nThe Papacy reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An East-West Schism in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for a crusade against Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land.[102] In Europe itself, the Church organised the Inquisition against heretics. In the Iberian Peninsula, the Reconquista concluded with the fall of Granada in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the south-western peninsula.[103]\n\n\nIn the east, a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims, and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.[104] The Empire was weakened following the defeat at Manzikert, and was weakened considerably by the sack of Constantinople in 1204, during the Fourth Crusade.[105][106][107][108][109][110][111][112][113] Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, Byzantium fell in 1453 when Constantinople was taken by the Ottoman Empire.[114][115][116]\n\n\n\n![](image)The sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan in 1238, during the Mongol invasion of Europe (1220s–1240s)\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Pechenegs and the Cuman-Kipchaks, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.[117] Like many other parts of Eurasia, these territories were overrun by the Mongols.[118] The invaders, who became known as Tatars, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the Golden Horde with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion, and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries.[119][120] After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: Moldavia and Walachia. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans.[121] From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the Grand Duchy of Moscow grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480, and eventually becoming the Tsardom of Russia. The state was consolidated under Ivan III the Great and Ivan the Terrible, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.\n\n\nThe Great Famine of 1315–1317 was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages.[122] The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of France was reduced by half.[123][124] Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines,[125] and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period.[126] Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the Black Death, one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe alone—a third of the European population at the time.[127]\n\n\nThe plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in *The Decameron* (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased persecution of Jews, beggars and lepers.[128] The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century.[129] During this period, more than 100 plague epidemics swept across Europe.[130]\n\n\n\n### Early modern period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early modern period\n\nSee also: Renaissance, Reformation, Scientific Revolution, and Age of Discovery\n\n![](image)*The School of Athens* by Raphael (1511): Contemporaries, such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci (centre), are portrayed as classical scholars of the Renaissance.\nThe Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in Florence, and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical Greek and Arabic knowledge from monastic libraries, often translated from Arabic into Latin.[131][132][133] The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of art, philosophy, music, and the sciences, under the joint patronage of royalty, the nobility, the Roman Catholic Church and an emerging merchant class.[134][135][136] Patrons in Italy, including the Medici family of Florentine bankers and the Popes in Rome, funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci.[137][138]\n\n\nPolitical intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in Avignon and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.[139] In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Spain and Portugal, the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.[140][141] Exploration reached the Southern Hemisphere in the Atlantic and the Southern tip of Africa. Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492, and Vasco da Gama opened the ocean route to the East linking the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in 1498. The Portuguese-born explorer Ferdinand Magellan reached Asia westward across the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans in a Spanish expedition, resulting in the first circumnavigation of the globe, completed by the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano (1519–1522). Soon after, the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing large global empires in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania.[142] France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas and Asia. In 1588, a Spanish armada failed to invade England. A year later England tried unsuccessfully to invade Spain, allowing Philip II of Spain to maintain his dominant war capacity in Europe. This English disaster also allowed the Spanish fleet to retain its capability to wage war for the next decades. However, two more Spanish armadas failed to invade England (2nd Spanish Armada and 3rd Spanish Armada).[143][144][145][146]\n\n\n\n![](image)Habsburg dominions in the centuries following their partition by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The principal military base of Philip II in Europe was the Spanish road stretching from the Netherlands to the Duchy of Milan.[147]\nThe Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation in 1517 when German theologian Martin Luther nailed his *Ninety-five Theses* criticising the selling of indulgences to the church door. He was subsequently excommunicated in the papal bull *Exsurge Domine* in 1520 and his followers were condemned in the 1521 Diet of Worms, which divided German princes between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths.[148] Religious fighting and warfare spread with Protestantism.[149] The plunder of the empires of the Americas allowed Spain to finance religious persecution in Europe for over a century.[150] The Thirty Years War (1618–1648) crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.[151] In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, France rose to predominance within Europe.[152] The defeat of the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 marked the historic end of Ottoman expansion into Europe.[153]\n\n\nThe 17th century in Central and parts of Eastern Europe was a period of general decline;[154] the region experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700.[155] From the Union of Krewo (1385) east-central Europe was dominated by the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The hegemony of the vast Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had ended with the devastation brought by the Second Northern War (Deluge) and subsequent conflicts;[156] the state itself was partitioned and ceased to exist at the end of the 18th century.[157]\n\n\nFrom the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the Golden Horde were conquered by Russia, Tatars from the Crimean Khanate frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture slaves.[158] Further east, the Nogai Horde and Kazakh Khanate frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of contemporary Russia and Ukraine for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia).\n\n\nThe Renaissance and the New Monarchs marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention and scientific development.[159] Among the great figures of the Western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Isaac Newton.[160] According to Peter Barrett, \"It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world.\"[131]\n\n\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Modern history\n\nSee also: Industrial Revolution, French Revolution, and Age of Enlightenment\n\n![](image)The national boundaries within Europe set by the Congress of Vienna\nThe Seven Years' War brought to an end the \"Old System\" of alliances in Europe. Consequently, when the American Revolutionary War turned into a global war between 1778 and 1783, Britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of European powers, and lacking any substantial ally.[161]\n\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment was a powerful intellectual movement during the 18th century promoting scientific and reason-based thoughts.[162][163][164] Discontent with the aristocracy and clergy's monopoly on political power in France resulted in the French Revolution, and the establishment of the First Republic as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial reign of terror.[165] Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power in the aftermath of the French Revolution, and established the First French Empire that, during the Napoleonic Wars, grew to encompass large parts of Europe before collapsing in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo.[166][167] Napoleonic rule resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the French Revolution, including that of the nation state, as well as the widespread adoption of the French models of administration, law and education.[168][169][170] The Congress of Vienna, convened after Napoleon's downfall, established a new balance of power in Europe centred on the five \"Great Powers\": the UK, France, Prussia, Austria and Russia.[171] This balance would remain in place until the Revolutions of 1848, during which liberal uprisings affected all of Europe except for Russia and the UK. These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted.[172] The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed; 1871 saw the unifications of both Italy and Germany as nation-states from smaller principalities.[173]\n\n\nIn parallel, the Eastern Question grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the Great Powers struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The Russian Empire stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the Habsburg Empire and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the Serbian revolution (1804) and Greek War of Independence (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the Balkans, which ended with the Balkan Wars in 1912–1913.[174] Formal recognition of the *de facto* independent principalities of Montenegro, Serbia and Romania ensued at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.\n\n\n\n![](image)Marshall's Temple Works (1840); the Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain.\nThe Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe. The invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth, mass employment and the rise of a new working class.[175] Reforms in social and economic spheres followed, including the first laws on child labour, the legalisation of trade unions,[176] and the abolition of slavery.[177] In Britain, the Public Health Act of 1875 was passed, which significantly improved living conditions in many British cities.[178] Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.[179] The last major famine recorded in Western Europe, the Great Famine of Ireland, caused death and mass emigration of millions of Irish people.[180] In the 19th century, 70 million people left Europe in migrations to various European colonies abroad and to the United States.[181] The industrial revolution also led to large population growth, and the share of the world population living in Europe reached a peak of slightly above 25% around the year 1913.[182][183]\n\n\n\n### 20th century to the present[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Modern era and History of Europe\n\nSee also: World War I, Great Depression, Interwar period, Second World War, Cold War, and History of the European Union\n\n![](image)Map of European colonial empires throughout the world in 1914\nTwo world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. The First World War was fought between 1914 and 1918. It started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated by the Yugoslav nationalist[184] Gavrilo Princip.[185] Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the Entente Powers (France, Belgium, Serbia, Portugal, Russia, the United Kingdom, and later Italy, Greece, Romania, and the United States) and the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire). The war left more than 16 million civilians and military dead.[186] Over 60 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map depicting the military alliances of the First World War in 1914–1918\nRussia was plunged into the Russian Revolution, which threw down the Tsarist monarchy and replaced it with the communist Soviet Union,[188] leading also to the independence of many former Russian governorates, such as Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as new European countries.[189] Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.[190] Excess deaths in Russia over the course of the First World War and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million.[191] In 1932–1933, under Stalin's leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the second Soviet famine which caused millions of deaths;[192] surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour. Stalin was also responsible for the Great Purge of 1937–38 in which the NKVD executed 681,692 people;[193] millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Serbian war efforts (1914–1918) cost the country one quarter of its population.[195][196][197][198][199]\n![](image)Nazi Germany began the devastating Second World War in Europe by its leader, Adolf Hitler. Here Hitler, on the right, with his closest ally, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, in 1940.\nThe social revolutions sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following The Great War: in 1919, with the Weimar Republic in Germany and the First Austrian Republic; in 1922, with Mussolini's one-party fascist government in the Kingdom of Italy and in Atatürk's Turkish Republic, adopting the Western alphabet and state secularism.\nEconomic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This, and the Wall Street Crash of 1929, brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, fascist movements developed throughout Europe placing Adolf Hitler in power of what became Nazi Germany.[200][201]\n\n\nIn 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the Saarland and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria became a part of Germany following the Anschluss. Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, controlled by Germany and the Slovak Republic. At the time, the United Kingdom and France preferred a policy of appeasement.\n\n\nWith tensions mounting between Germany and Poland over the future of Danzig, the Germans turned to the Soviets and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the European Theatre of the Second World War.[202][203][204] The Soviet invasion of Poland started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the Baltic countries and, on 30 November, Finland, the latter of which was followed by the devastating Winter War for the Red Army.[205] The British hoped to land at Narvik and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The Phoney War continued.\n\n\nIn May 1940, Germany attacked France through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August, Germany had begun a bombing offensive against the United Kingdom but failed to convince the Britons to give up.[206] In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa.[207] On 7 December 1941 Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the British Empire, and other allied forces.[208][209]\n\n\n\n![](image)The \"Big Three\" at the Yalta Conference in 1945; seated (from the left): Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin\nAfter the staggering Battle of Stalingrad in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The Battle of Kursk, which involved the largest tank battle in history, was the last major German offensive on the Eastern Front. In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the D-Day landings, opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally fell in 1945, ending the Second World War in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with 60 million dead across the world.[210] More than 40 million people in Europe had died as a result of the Second World War,[211] including between 11 and 17 million people who perished during the Holocaust.[212] The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all Second World War casualties.[213] By the end of the Second World War, Europe had more than 40 million refugees.[214][215][216] Several post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20 million people.[217]\n\n\nThe First World War, and especially the Second World War, diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After the Second World War the map of Europe was redrawn at the Yalta Conference and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by Winston Churchill an \"Iron Curtain\". The United States and Western Europe established the NATO alliance and, later, the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the Warsaw Pact.[218] Particular hot spots after the Second World War were Berlin and Trieste, whereby the Free Territory of Trieste, founded in 1947 with the UN, was dissolved in 1954 and 1975, respectively. The Berlin blockade in 1948 and 1949 and the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 were one of the great international crises of the Cold War.[219][220][221]\n\n\nThe two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on nuclear proliferation. At the same time decolonisation, which had already started after the First World War, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Flag of Europe, adopted by the Council of Europe in 1955 as the flag for the whole of Europe[222]\nIn the 1980s the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Solidarity movement in Poland weakened the previously rigid communist system. The opening of the Iron Curtain at the Pan-European Picnic then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which the Eastern bloc, the Warsaw Pact and other communist states collapsed, and the Cold War ended.[223][224][225] Germany was reunited, after the symbolic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.[226] This made old previously interrupted cultural and economic relationships possible, and previously isolated cities such as Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Trieste were now again in the centre of Europe.[200][227][228][229]\n\n\nEuropean integration also grew after the Second World War. In 1949 the Council of Europe was founded, following a speech by Sir Winston Churchill, with the idea of unifying Europe[18] to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for Belarus, Russia,[230] and Vatican City. The Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the European Economic Community between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.[231] In 1967 the EEC, European Coal and Steel Community, and Euratom formed the European Community, which in 1993 became the European Union. The EU established a parliament, court and central bank, and introduced the euro as a unified currency.[232] Between 2004 and 2013, more Central European countries began joining, expanding the EU to 28 European countries and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.[233] However, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020, as a result of a June 2016 referendum on EU membership.[234] The Russo-Ukrainian conflict, which has been ongoing since 2014, steeply escalated when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, marking the largest humanitarian and refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War[235] and the Yugoslav Wars.[236]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Europe\n\n![](image)Map of populous Europe and surrounding regions showing physical, political and population characteristics, as per 2018\nEurope makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass.[28] It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.[237] Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas to the south.[238]\nLand relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps, Pyrenees and Carpathians, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain and at its heart lies the North German Plain. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.\n\n\nThis description is simplified. Subregions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean that is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Europe\n\n![](image)Biomes of Europe and surrounding regions:   \n      tundra      alpine tundra      taiga      montane forest   \n      temperate broadleaf forest      mediterranean forest      temperate steppe      dry steppe\nEurope lies mainly in the temperate climate zone of the northern hemisphere, where the prevailing wind direction is from the west. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream, an ocean current which carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico across the Atlantic ocean to Europe.[239] The Gulf Stream is nicknamed \"Europe's central heating\", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\nTherefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Aveiro is 16 °C (61 °F), while it is only 13 °C (55 °F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude, bordering the same ocean. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in far south-eastern Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8 °C (14 °F) higher than those in Calgary and they are almost 22 °C (40 °F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.[239]\n\n\nThe large water masses of the Mediterranean Sea, which equalise the temperatures on an annual and daily average, are also of particular importance. The water of the Mediterranean extends from the Sahara desert to the Alpine arc in its northernmost part of the Adriatic Sea near Trieste.[240]\n\n\nIn general, Europe is not just colder towards the north compared to the south, but it also gets colder from the west towards the east. The climate is more oceanic in the west and less so in the east. This can be illustrated by the following table of average temperatures at locations roughly following the 64th, 60th, 55th, 50th, 45th and 40th latitudes. None of them is located at high altitude; most of them are close to the sea.

Around 1.1 billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the Laurentia block) became joined to Rodinia, later resplitting around 550 million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440 million years ago Euramerica was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with Gondwana then leading to the formation of Pangea. Around 190 million years ago, Gondwana and Laurasia split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via Greenland, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50 million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late Tertiary period about five million years ago.[243]\n\n\nThe geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the Scottish Highlands to the rolling plains of Hungary.[244] Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous Southern Europe and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and Alps/Carpathians. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the Scandinavian Mountains and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the Celtic Sea, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea complex and Barents Sea.\n\n\nThe northern plain contains the old geological continent of Baltica and so may be regarded geologically as the \"main continent\", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent Avalonia.\n\n\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green) and tundra, or bogs, in the north (dark yellow)\nHaving lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of humans. With the exception of Fennoscandia and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various national parks.\n\n\nThe main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed forest. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift warm the continent. Southern Europe has a warm but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these, such as the Alps and the Pyrenees, are oriented east–west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south–north (Scandinavian Mountains, Dinarides, Carpathians, Apennines) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time, and the cutting down of the preagricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.\n\n\n\n![](image)Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch\nPossibly 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.[245] It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation, Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the broadleaf and mixed forests, taiga of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed rainforests of the Caucasus and the Cork oak forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, while in its Western Russia its 5–10%. The European country with the smallest percentage of forested area is Iceland (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).[246]\n\n\nIn temperate Europe, mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are beech and oak. In the north, the taiga is a mixed spruce–pine–birch forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to tundra as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many olive trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; Mediterranean Cypress is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east–west tongue of Eurasian grassland (the steppe) extends westwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.\n\n\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fauna of Europe\n\n![](image)Biogeographic regions of Europe and bordering regions\nGlaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of humans affected the distribution of European fauna. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction. The woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the Neolithic period. Today wolves (carnivores) and bears (omnivores) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the Middle Ages the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula, Scandinavia and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, polar bears may be found on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The wolf, the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of Western Europe (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).\n\n\n\n![](image)Once roaming the great temperate forests of Eurasia, European bison now live in nature preserves in Białowieża Forest, on the border between Poland and Belarus.[247][248]\nOther carnivores include the European wildcat, red fox and arctic fox, the golden jackal, different species of martens, the European hedgehog, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, as well as different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).\n\n\nImportant European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the small tortoiseshell butterfly, add to the biodiversity.[249]\n\n\nSea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly phytoplankton. Important animals that live in European seas are zooplankton, molluscs, echinoderms, different crustaceans, squids and octopuses, fish, dolphins and whales.\n\n\nBiodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's Bern Convention, which has also been signed by the European Community as well as non-European states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Europe\n\nSee also: List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe, International organisations in Europe, Regions of Europe, and European integration\n\n![](image)\nA clickable Euler diagram[file] showing the relationships between various multinational European organisations and agreements * v\n* t\n* e\n\nThe political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is parliamentary democracy, in most cases in the form of Republic; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the Monarchy. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies[250] are constitutional.\n\n\nEuropean integration is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the Council of Europe since the end of the Second World War. The European Union has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the Eurasian Economic Union has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.\n\n\n27 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free Schengen Area and 20 of the monetary union Eurozone. Among the smaller European organisations are the Nordic Council, the Benelux, the Baltic Assembly and the Visegrád Group.\n\n\n\n## List of states and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of

Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as the Canary Islands and Heligoland, are also not included for this reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Symbol | Flag | Name\n | Sovereignstate\n | Area(km2)\n | Population | Populationdensity(per km2)\n | Capital |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Åland](image) | ![Åland](image) | Åland | Finland\n | 1,580\n | 29,489\n | 18.36\n | Mariehamn |\n| ![Bailiwick of Guernsey](image) | ![](image) | Bailiwick of Guernsey[c] | UK\n | 78\n | 65,849\n | 844.0\n | St. Peter Port |\n| ![Jersey](image) | ![Jersey](image) | Bailiwick of Jersey[c] | UK\n | 118.2\n | 100,080\n | 819\n | Saint Helier |\n| ![Faroe Islands](image) | ![Faroe Islands](image) | Faroe Islands | Denmark\n | 1,399\n | 50,778\n | 35.2\n | Tórshavn |\n| ![Gibraltar](image) | ![Gibraltar](image) | Gibraltar | UK\n | 6.7\n | 32,194\n | 4,328\n | Gibraltar |\n| ![Greenland](image) | ![Greenland](image) | Greenland | Denmark[r] | 2,166,086\n | 55,877\n | 0.028\n | Nuuk |\n| ![Isle of Man](image) | ![Isle of Man](image) | Isle of Man[c] | UK\n | 572\n | 83,314\n | 148\n | Douglas |\n|  | ![Svalbard](image) | Svalbard | Norway\n | 61,022\n | 2,667\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Europe, List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal), and List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (PPP)\n\n![](image)GDP (PPP) per capita of European countries in 2021\n \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|      >$60,000  |      $50,000 – $60,000  |\n|      $40,000 – $50,000  |      $30,000 – $40,000  |\n|      $20,000 – $30,000  |      $10,000 – $20,000 |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nAs a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7 trillion compared to North America's $27.1 trillion in 2008.[251] In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.[252] As with other continents, Europe has a large wealth gap among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the Northwest and West in general, followed by Central Europe, while most economies of Eastern and Southeastern Europe are still reemerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\n\nThe model of the Blue Banana was designed as an economic geographic representation of the respective economic power of the regions, which was further developed into the Golden Banana or Blue Star. The trade between East and West, as well as towards Asia, which had been disrupted for a long time by the two world wars, new borders and the Cold War, increased sharply after 1989. In addition, there is new impetus from the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative across the Suez Canal towards Africa and Asia.[253]\n\n\nThe European Union, a political entity composed of 27 European states, comprises the largest single economic area in the world. Nineteen EU countries share the euro as a common currency.\nFive European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest national economies in GDP (PPP). This includes (ranks according to the CIA): Germany (6), Russia (7), the United Kingdom (10), France (11) and Italy (13).[254]\n\n\nSome European countries are much richer than others. The richest in terms of nominal GDP is Monaco with its US$185,829 per capita (2018) and the poorest is Ukraine with its US$3,659 per capita (2019).[255]\n\n\nAs a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.[256]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (nominal, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *![](image) European Union*[257] | 19,226,235 | 2008\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Germany | 4,429,838 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) United Kingdom | 3,332,059 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) France | 3,049,016 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Italy[258] | 2,408,655 | 2008\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Russia | 2,288,428 | 2013\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Spain[259] | 1,631,863 | 2008\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Turkey | 1,154,600 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Netherlands | 1,092,748 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)  Switzerland | 905,684 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Poland | 842,172 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (PPP, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *![](image) European Union*[260] | 25,430,409 | 2023\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Germany | 5,537,992 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Russia[261] | 5,326,855 | 2022\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) United Kingdom | 3,871,790 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) France | 3,868,619 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Turkey | 3,613,540 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Italy | 3,193,180 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Spain | 2,413,066 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Poland | 1,712,629 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Netherlands | 1,297,024 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Romania | 794,055 | 2022\n |\n\n\n\n### Economic history[edit]\n\n\nIndustrial growth (1760–1945)\nCapitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.[262] From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.[263] The Industrial Revolution started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,[264] and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by the First World War, but by the beginning of the Second World War, they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. The Second World War, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.\n\n\n\nCold War (1945–1991)\n![](image)Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989\n![](image)Eurozone (blue colour)\nAfter the Second World War the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,[265] and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.[266] Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.[267] France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of Franco, also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the Spanish miracle.[268] The majority of Central and Eastern European states came under the control of the Soviet Union and thus were members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON).[269]\n\n\nThe states which retained a free-market system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the Marshall Plan.[270] The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the Cold War. Until 1990, the European Community was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.\n\n\n\nReunification (1991–present)\n![](image)One of Kosovo's main economical sources is mining, because it has large reserves of lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron and bauxite.[271] Miners at the Trepča Mines in Mitrovica, Kosovo in 2011.\nWith the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states underwent shock therapy measures to liberalise their economies and implement free market reforms.\n\n\nAfter East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany, while the latter experienced sudden mass unemployment and plummeting of industrial production.\n\n\nBy the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe, comprising the five largest European economies of the time: Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the Eurozone, replacing their national currencies by the euro.\n\n\nFigures released by Eurostat in 2009 confirmed that the Eurozone had gone into recession in 2008.[272] It impacted much of the region.[273] In 2010, fears of a sovereign debt crisis[274] developed concerning some countries in Europe, especially Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal.[275] As a result, measures were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone.[276] The EU-27 unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2012.[277] For those aged 15–24 it was 22.4%.[277]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Europe\n\nSee also: List of European countries by population, List of European countries by life expectancy, and Ageing of Europe\n\n![](image)Population growth in and around Europe in 2021[278]\nThe population of Europe was about 742 million in 2023 according to UN estimates.[2][3] This is slightly more than one ninth of the world's population.[c] The population density of Europe (the number of people per area) is the second highest of any continent, behind Asia. The population of Europe is currently slowly decreasing, by about 0.2% per year,[279] because there are fewer births than deaths. This natural decrease in population is reduced by the fact that more people migrate to Europe from other continents than vice versa.\n\n\nSouthern Europe and Western Europe are the regions with the highest average number of elderly people in the world, today they comprise 21% of the population, with over 65 years.[280] Projections suggest that by 2050 Europe will reach 30%.[281] This is caused by the fact that the population has been having children below replacement level since the 1970s. The United Nations predicts that Europe will decline its population between 2022 and 2050 by −7 per cent, without changing immigration movements.[282]\n\n\nAccording to a population projection of the UN Population Division, Europe's population may fall to between 680 and 720 million people by 2050, which would be 7% of the world population at that time.[283] Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to fertility rates. The average number of children per female of child-bearing age is 1.52, far below the replacement rate.[284] The UN predicts a steady population decline in Central and Eastern Europe as a result of emigration and low birth rates.[285]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Europe\n\nFurther information: Genetic history of Europe\n\nPan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \"peoples of Europe\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities.[286]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Immigration to Europe and European diaspora\n\n![](image)Map showing areas of European settlement (people who claim full European descent)\nEurope is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at nearly 87 million people in 2020, according to the International Organisation for Migration.[287] In 2005, the EU had an overall net gain from immigration of 1.8 million people. This accounted for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth.[288] In 2021, 827,000 persons were given citizenship of an EU member state, an increase of about 14% compared with 2020.[289] 2.3 million immigrants from non-EU countries entered the EU in 2021.[289]\n\n\nEarly modern emigration from Europe began with Spanish and Portuguese settlers in the 16th century,[290][291] and French and English settlers in the 17th century.[292] But numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the 19th century, when millions of poor families left Europe.[293]\n\n\nToday, large populations of European descent are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Brazil, while most of the other Latin American countries also have a considerable population of European origins). Australia and New Zealand have large European-derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of Cape Verde and probably São Tomé and Príncipe, depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the White South Africans in South Africa. In Asia, European-derived populations, (specifically Russians), predominate in North Asia and some parts of Northern Kazakhstan.[294]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Europe\n\n![](image)Distribution of major languages of EuropeSee also: List of European languages by number of speakers\n\nEurope has about 225 indigenous languages,[295] mostly falling within three Indo-European language groups: the Romance languages, derived from the Latin of the Roman Empire; the Germanic languages, whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the Slavic languages.[243] Slavic languages are mostly spoken in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in Western and Southern Europe, as well as in Switzerland in Central Europe and Romania and Moldova in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Western, Northern and Central Europe as well as in Gibraltar and Malta in Southern Europe.[243] Languages in adjacent areas show significant overlaps (such as in English, for example). Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the Baltic group (Latvian and Lithuanian), the Celtic group (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish and Breton[243]), Greek, Armenian and Albanian.\n\n\nA distinct non-Indo-European family of Uralic languages (Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Erzya, Komi, Mari, Moksha and Udmurt) is spoken mainly in Estonia, Finland, Hungary and parts of Russia. Turkic languages include Azerbaijani, Kazakh and Turkish, in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe (Balkan Gagauz Turkish, Bashkir, Chuvash, Crimean Tatar, Karachay-Balkar, Kumyk, Nogai and Tatar). Kartvelian languages (Georgian, Mingrelian and Svan) are spoken primarily in Georgia. Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed Northeast Caucasian, most notably including Chechen, Avar and Lezgin; and Northwest Caucasian, most notably including Adyghe). Maltese is the only Semitic language that is official within the EU, while Basque is the only European language isolate.\n\n\nMultilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Europe\n\nReligion in Europe according to the *Global Religious Landscape* survey by the Pew Forum, 2016[8]\n\n\n\nChristianity (76.2%)\nNo religion (18.3%)\nIslam (4.9%)\nBuddhism (0.2%)\nHinduism (0.2%)\nFolk religion (0.1%)\nOther religions (0.1%)\n\nThe largest religion in Europe is Christianity, with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves Christians,[296][297] including Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and various Protestant denominations. Among Protestants, the most popular are Lutheranism, Anglicanism and the Reformed faith. Smaller Protestant denominations include Anabaptists as well as denominations centered in the United States such as Pentecostalism, Methodism, and Evangelicalism. Although Christianity originated in the Middle East, its centre of mass shifted to Europe when it became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the late 4th century. Christianity played a prominent role in the development of the European culture and identity.[298][299][300] Today, a bit over 25% of the world's Christians live in Europe.[301]\n\n\nIslam is the second most popular religion in Europe. Over 25 million, or roughly 5% of the population, adhere to it.[302] In Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, two countries in the Balkan peninsula in Southeastern Europe, Islam instead of Christianity is the majority religion. This is of also the case in Turkey and in certain parts of Russia, as well as in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, all of which are at the border to Asia.[302] Many countries in Europe are home to a sizeable Muslim minority, and immigration to Europe has increased the number of Muslim people in Europe in recent years.\n\n\nThe Jewish population in Europe was about 1.4 million people in 2020 (about 0.2% of the population).[303] There is a long history of Jewish life in Europe, beginning in antiquity. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Russian Empire had the majority of the world's Jews living within its borders.[304] In 1897, according to Russian census of 1897, the total Jewish population of Russia was 5.1 million people, which was 4.13% of total population. Of this total, the vast majority lived within the Pale of Settlement.[305] In 1933, there were about 9.5 million Jewish people in Europe, representing 1.7% of the population,[306] but most were killed or displaced across Europe during The Holocaust.[307][303] In the 21st century, France has the largest Jewish population in Europe, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia.[8]\n\n\nOther religions practiced in Europe include Hinduism and Buddhism, are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's Republic of Kalmykia).\n\n\nA large and increasing number people in Europe are irreligious, atheist and agnostic. They are estimated to make up about 18.3% of Europe's population currently.[8]\n\n\n\n### Major cities and urban areas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of European cities by population within city limits\n\nThe three largest urban areas of Europe are Moscow, London and Paris. All have over 10 million residents,[308] and as such have been described as megacities.[309] While Istanbul has the highest total city population, it lies partly in Asia. 64.9% of the residents live on the European side and 35.1% on the Asian side.\nThe next largest cities in order of population are Madrid, Saint Petersburg, Milan, Barcelona, Berlin, and Rome each having over three million residents.[308]\n\n\nWhen considering the commuter belts or metropolitan areas, within Europe (for which comparable data is available) Moscow covers the largest population, followed in order by Istanbul, London, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Ruhr Area, Saint Petersburg, Rhein-Süd, Barcelona and Berlin.[310]\n\n\n\nEuropean megacities\n![Moscow International Business Center](image)\nMoscow\n![City of London](image)\nLondon\n![](image)\nParis\n![Levent](image)\nIstanbul[b]\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Europe\n\nFurther information: European folklore and European art\n\n![](image)Map purportedly displaying the European continent split along cultural and state borders as proposed by the German organisation Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen [] (StAGN)\n\"Europe\" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of ancient Greece and the Roman Empire and its cultures. The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of Christendom (or more specifically Latin Christendom), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially against Islam, as in the Reconquista and the Ottoman wars in Europe.[311]\n\n\nThis shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into Slavic, Latin (Romance) and Germanic, but with several components not part of either of these group (notably Greek, Basque and Celtic). Historically, special examples with overlapping cultures are Strasbourg with Latin (Romance) and Germanic or Trieste with Latin, Slavic and Germanic roots.\nCultural contacts and mixtures shape a large part of the regional cultures of Europe. Europe is often described as \"maximum cultural diversity with minimal geographical distances\".\n\n\nDifferent cultural events are organised in Europe, with the aim of bringing different cultures closer together and raising awareness of their importance, such as the European Capital of Culture, the European Region of Gastronomy, the European Youth Capital and the European Capital of Sport.\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Sport in Europe.[edit]\n![](image)Football is by far the most popular sport in Europe. This picture shows Camp Nou in Barcelona before the 2023 renovation works started.\nSport in Europe tends to be highly organized with many sports having professional leagues.\n\n\n\nThe origins of many of the world's most popular sports today lie in the codification of many traditional games, especially in the United Kingdom. However, a paradoxical feature of European sport is the extent to which local, regional and national variations continue to exist, and even in some instances to predominate.[312]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n\n\nMain articles: List of Europe-related articles and Outline of Europe\n\nHistory\n* Baltica\n* Genetic history of Europe\n* Prehistoric Europe\n* Classical antiquity\n* Middle Ages\n* Early modern Europe\n* Modernity\n* History of Europe\n\n\nPolitics\n* Eurodistrict\n* Euroregion\n* Flags of Europe\n* List of sovereign states by date of formation\n* Names of European cities in different languages\n* OSCE countries statistics\n* European Union as a potential superpower\n\n\nDemographics\n* Area and population of European countries\n* Demographics of Europe\n* European Union statistics\n* List of European cities by population within city limits\n* List of urban areas in the European Union\n* List of cities in Europe\n* List of metropolitan areas in Europe\n* List of villages in Europe\n* Pan-European identity\n\n\nEconomics\n* Economy of the European Union\n* Financial and social rankings of European countries\n* Healthcare in Europe\n* Telecommunications in Europe\n* List of European television stations\n* List of European countries by GDP (nominal)\n\n\nCulture\n* European Capital of Culture\n* European Region of Gastronomy\n* European Youth Capital\n\n\nSports\n* European Games\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Europe is normally considered its own continent in the English-speaking world, which uses the seven continent model.[10][11] Other models consider Europe as part of a Eurasian or Afro-Eurasian continent.

The region includes Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Central America, Greenland, Mexico, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and the United States.\n\n\nNorth America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), representing approximately 16.5% of the Earth's land area and 4.8% of its total surface area. It is the third-largest continent by size after Asia and Africa, and the fourth-largest continent by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. As of 2013[update], North America's population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's population. In human geography and in the English-speaking world outside the United States, particularly in Canada, the terms \"North America\" and \"North American\" are typically defined as including just Canada and the United States.[6][7][8][9][10]\n\n\nThe first human populations reached North America during the Last Glacial Period approximately 20,000 to 17,000 years ago, during which they crossed the Bering land bridge in the Bering Strait on their way to reaching North America. The Paleo-Indian period in North America followed the Last Glacial Period, and lasted until about 10,000 years ago when the Archaic period began. The classic stage followed the Archaic period, and lasted from approximately the 6th to 13th centuries. Beginning in 1000 AD, the Norse were the first Europeans to begin exploring and ultimately colonizing areas of North America.\n\n\nIn 1492, the exploratory voyages of Christopher Columbus led to a transatlantic exchange, including migrations of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the early modern period. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists, indigenous peoples, African slaves, immigrants from Europe, Asia, and descendants of these respective groups.\n\n\nEurope's colonization in North America led to most North Americans speaking European languages, such as English, Spanish, and French, and the cultures of the region commonly reflect Western traditions. However, relatively small parts of North America in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America have indigenous populations that continue adhering to their respective pre-European colonial cultural and linguistic traditions.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information: Naming of the Americas, New Spain, Turtle Island (Native American folklore), and Vinland\n\n![](image)A 1621 map of North America\nThe Americas were named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by German cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann.[11] Vespucci explored South America between 1497 and 1502, and was the first European to suggest that the Americas represented a landmass not then known to Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller published a world map, and placed the word \"America\" on the continent of present-day South America.[12] The continent north of present-day Mexico was then referred to as Parias.[13] On a 1553 world map published by Petrus Apianus,[14] North America was called \"Baccalearum\", meaning \"realm of the Cod fish\", in reference to the abundance of cod fish on the East Coast.[15]\n\n\nWaldseemüller used the Latin version of Vespucci's name, Americus Vespucius, in its feminine form of \"America\", following the examples of \"Europa\", \"Asia\", and \"Africa\". Map makers later extended the name America to North America.\n\n\nIn 1538, Gerardus Mercator used the term America on his world map of the entire Western Hemisphere.[16] On his subsequent 1569 map, Mercator called North America \"America or New India\" (*America sive India Nova*).[17]\n\n\nThe Spanish Empire called its territories in North and South America \"Las Indias\", and the name given to the state body that oversaw the region was called the Council of the Indies.\n\n\n\n## Definitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 2005 NASA satellite image of North America\nThe United Nations and its statistics division recognize North America as including three regions: Northern America, Central America, and the Caribbean.[18] \"Northern America\" is a distinct term from \"North America\", excluding Central America, which itself may or may not include Mexico. In the limited context of regional trade agreements, the term is used to reference three nations, Canada, the United States, and Mexico.\n\n\nFrance, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Greece, and the countries of Latin America use a six-continent model, with the Americas viewed as a single continent and *North America* designating a subcontinent comprising Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon (politically part of France), and often including Greenland and Bermuda.[19][20][21][22][23]\n\n\nNorth America has historically been known by other names, including Spanish North America, New Spain, and América Septentrional, the first official name given to Mexico.[24]\n\n\n\n### Regions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of regions of Canada and List of regions of the United States\n\nNorth America includes several regions and subregions, each of which have their own respective cultural, economic, and geographic regions. Economic regions include several regions formalized in 20th and 21st century trade agreements, including NAFTA between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and CAFTA between Central America, the Dominican Republic, and the United States.\n\n\nNorth America is divided linguistically and culturally into two primary regions, Anglo-America and Latin America. Anglo-America includes most of North America, Belize, and Caribbean islands with English-speaking populations, though subnational entities, including Louisiana and Quebec, have large Francophone populations; in Quebec, French is the official language.[25].\n\n\nThe southern portion of North America includes Central America and non-English speaking Caribbean nations.[26][27] The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well. In contrast to the common definition of North America, which encompasses the whole North American continent, the term \"North America\" is sometimes used more narrowly to refer only to four nations, Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and the U.S.[28][29][30][31][32]\n\n\nThe term Northern America refers to the northernmost countries and territories of North America: the U.S., Bermuda, Canada, Greenland, and St. Pierre and Miquelon.[33][34] Although the term does not refer to a unified region,[35] Middle America includes Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.[36]\n\n\nNorth America's largest countries by land area are Canada and the U.S., both of which have well-defined and recognized subregions. In Canada, these include (from east to west) Atlantic Canada, Central Canada, Canadian Prairies, the British Columbia Coast, and Northern Canada. In the U.S., they include New England, the Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic states, East North Central states, West North Central states, East South Central states, West South Central states, Mountain states, and Pacific states. The Great Lakes region and the Pacific Northwest include areas in both Canada and the U.S.\n\n\n\n### Countries, dependencies, and other territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America\n\nSource: \"Ecoregions of North America\".

The Gulf of Mexico is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by Hudson Bay. Others include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Gulf of California.\n\n\nBefore the Central American isthmus formed, the region had been underwater. The islands of the West Indies delineate a submerged former land bridge, which had connected North and South America via what are now Florida and Venezuela.\n\n\nThere are several islands off the continent's coasts; principally, the Arctic Archipelago, the Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, the Greater and Lesser Antilles, the Aleutian Islands (some of which are in the Eastern Hemisphere proper), the Alexander Archipelago, the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast, and Newfoundland. Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, and the world's largest, is on the same tectonic plate (the North American Plate) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island that was formed on the fissure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge over 100 million years ago (mya). The nearest landmass to it is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. However, Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to Virginia and other parts of the continent.\n\n\nThe vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts of western Mexico, including Baja California, and of California, including the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles, and Santa Cruz, lie on the eastern edge of the Pacific Plate, with the two plates meeting along the San Andreas fault. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the Caribbean Plate, whereas the Juan de Fuca and Cocos plates border the North American Plate on its western frontier.\n\n\nThe continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the Great Plains stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian Arctic; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, California and Alaska; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long plateaus and cordilleras, falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.\n\n\nThe western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the coast ranges in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts—in between. The highest peak is Denali in Alaska.\n\n\nThe U.S. Geographical Survey (USGS) states that the geographic center of North America is \"6 miles [10 km] west of Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota\" at about 48°10′N 100°10′W﻿ / ﻿48.167°N 100.167°W﻿ / 48.167; -100.167, about 24 kilometers (15 mi) from Rugby, North Dakota. The USGS further states that \"No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the 50 states, the conterminous United States, or the North American continent.\"[51] Nonetheless, there is a 4.6-meter (15 ft) field stone obelisk in Rugby claiming to mark the center. The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is located 1,650 km (1,030 mi) from the nearest coastline, between Allen and Kyle, South Dakota at 43°22′N 101°58′W﻿ / ﻿43.36°N 101.97°W﻿ / 43.36; -101.97﻿ (Pole of Inaccessibility North America).[52]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of North America\n\n#### Geologic history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The principal water divisions in Canada, the United States, and Mexico\nLaurentia is an ancient craton which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the Proterozoic eon.[53] The Canadian Shield is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea, with Eurasia to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains, which formed some 480 mya, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 mya, North America became part of Laurasia, before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-Cretaceous period.[54] The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny, between 80 and 55 mya. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 mya,[55] and the Great Lakes (as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.\n\n\nNorth America is the source of much of what humanity knows about geologic time periods.[56] The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of dinosaurs than any other modern country.[56] According to paleontologist Peter Dodson, this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, and history.[56] Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent.[56] The most significant Late Jurassic dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in North America is the Morrison Formation of the western U.S.[57]\n\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canada\n\n![](image)A geologic map of North America published by the U.S. Geographical Survey\nCanada is geographically one of the oldest regions in the world, with more than half of the region consisting of Precambrian rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era.[58] Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive.[58] Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic,[59] making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield, there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.[60] The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States\n\nThe lower 48 U.S. states can be divided into roughly five physiographic provinces:\n\n\n\n1. The American cordillera\n2. The Canadian Shield[58] Northern portion of the upper midwestern U.S.\n3. The stable platform\n4. The coastal plain\n5. The Appalachian orogenic belt\n\n\nThe geology of Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera, while the major islands of Hawaii consist of Neogene volcanics erupted over a hot spot.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA 2003 image of North America's bedrock and terrain\n![](image)\nA 2015 map of North America's cratons and basement rocks\n\n#### Central America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Central America\n\n![](image)Central America rests on the Caribbean Plate.\nCentral America is geologically active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a major earthquake, killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one earthquake devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in Honduras a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009.\n\n\nVolcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in agriculturally productive highland areas.\n\n\nCentral America has many mountain ranges; the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia, and the Cordillera de Talamanca. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact, most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans, and other crops.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Köppen climate classification map of North America\nNorth America is a very large continent that extends from north of the Arctic Circle to south of the Tropic of Cancer. Greenland, along with the Canadian Shield, is tundra with average temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 °C (50 to 68 °F), but central Greenland is composed of a very large ice sheet. This tundra radiates throughout Canada, but its border ends near the Rocky Mountains (but still contains Alaska) and at the end of the Canadian Shield, near the Great Lakes.\nClimate west of the Cascade Range is described as being temperate weather with average precipitation 20 inches (510 millimeters).[61]\nClimate in coastal California is described to be Mediterranean, with average temperatures in cities like San Francisco ranging from 57 to 70 °F (14 to 21 °C) over the course of the year.[62]\n\n\nStretching from the East Coast to eastern North Dakota, and stretching down to Kansas, is the humid continental climate featuring intense seasons, with a large amount of annual precipitation, with places like New York City averaging 50 in (1,300 mm).[63]\nStarting at the southern border of the humid continental climate and stretching to the Gulf of Mexico (whilst encompassing the eastern half of Texas) is the humid subtropical climate. This area has the wettest cities in the contiguous U.S., with annual precipitation reaching 67 in (1,700 mm) in Mobile, Alabama.[64]\nStretching from the borders of the humid continental and subtropical climates, and going west to the Sierra Nevada, south to the southern tip of Durango, north to the border with tundra climate, the steppe/desert climates are the driest in the United States.[65] Highland climates cut from north to south of the continent, where subtropical or temperate climates occur just below the tropics, as in central Mexico and Guatemala. Tropical climates appear in the island regions and in the subcontinent's bottleneck, found in countries and states bathed by the Caribbean Sea or to the south of the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.[66] Precipitation patterns vary across the region, and as such rainforest, monsoon, and savanna types can be found, with rains and high temperatures throughout the year.\n\n\n\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(March 2015)*\n |\n\n\nSee also: List of endangered plants in North America\n\nNotable North American fauna include the bison, black bear, jaguar, cougar, prairie dog, turkey, pronghorn, raccoon, coyote, and monarch butterfly.\n\n\nNotable plants that were domesticated in North America include tobacco, maize, squash, tomato, sunflower, blueberry, avocado, cotton, chile pepper, and vanilla.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of North America\n\n### Pre-Columbian era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)A map of subsistence methods in the Americas, including North America, as of 1000 BCE Hunter-gatherers\n Simple farming societies\n Complex agricultural societies, including tribal chiefdoms and civilizations\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Americas have many creation myths by which they assert that they have been present on the land since its creation,[67] but there is no evidence that humans evolved there.[68] The specifics of the initial settlement of the Americas by ancient Asians are subject to ongoing research and discussion.[69] The traditional theory has been that hunters entered the Bering Land Bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska from 27,000 to 14,000 years ago.[70][71][h] A growing viewpoint is that the first American inhabitants sailed from Beringia some 13,000 years ago,[73] with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the Last Glacial Period, in what is known as the Late Glacial Maximum, around 12,500 years ago.[74] The oldest petroglyphs in North America date from 15,000 to 10,000 years before present.[75][i] Genetic research and anthropology indicate additional waves of migration from Asia via the Bering Strait during the Early-Middle Holocene.[77][78][79]\n\n\nPrior to the arrival of European explorers and colonists in North America, the natives of North America were divided into many different polities, ranging from small bands of a few families to large empires. They lived in several culture areas, which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones that defined the representative cultures and lifestyles of the indigenous people who lived there, including the bison hunters of the Great Plains and the farmers of Mesoamerica. Native groups also are classified by their language families, which included Athapascan and Uto-Aztecan languages. Indigenous peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture, however, and were not necessarily always allies. Anthropologists speculate that the Inuit of the high Arctic arrived in North America much later than other native groups, evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record and their replacement by the Thule people.\n\n\nDuring the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest yet discovered is the Clovis culture (c. 9550–9050 BCE) in modern New Mexico.[76] Later groups include the Mississippian culture and related Mound building cultures, found in the Mississippi River valley and the Pueblo culture of what is now the Four Corners. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world, such as tomatoes, squash, and maize. As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many other cultural advances were made there. The Mayans developed a writing system, built huge pyramids and temples, had a complex calendar, and developed the concept of zero around 400 CE.[80]\n\n\nThe first recorded European references to North America are in Norse sagas where it is referred to as Vinland.[81] The earliest verifiable instance of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact by any European culture with the North America mainland has been dated to around 1000 CE.[82] The site, situated at the northernmost extent of the island named Newfoundland, has provided unmistakable evidence of Norse settlement.[83] Norse explorer Leif Erikson (c. 970–1020 CE) is thought to have visited the area.[j] Erikson was the first European to make landfall on the continent (excluding Greenland).[85][86]\n\n\nThe Mayan culture was still present in southern Mexico and Guatemala when the Spanish conquistadors arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire, whose capital city Tenochtitlan was located further north in the Valley of Mexico. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by Hernán Cortés.[87]\n\n\n\n### Post-contact, 1492–1910[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European colonization of the Americas\n\nFurther information: Timeline of the European colonization of North America, British America, French America, New Spain, and Russian colonization of the Americas\n\n![](image)A 1702 map of North America showing forts, towns, and (in solid colors) areas occupied by European colonial settlements\nDuring the so-called Age of Discovery, Europeans explored overseas and staked claims to various parts of North America, much of which was already settled by indigenous peoples. Upon Europeans' arrival in the \"New World\", indigenous peoples had a variety of reactions, including curiosity, trading, cooperation, resignation, and resistance. The indigenous population declined substantially following European arrival, primarily due to the introduction of Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox, to which the indigenous peoples lacked immunity, and because of violent conflicts with Europeans.[88] Indigenous culture changed significantly and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic groups died out, and others changed quite quickly.\n\n\nOn the North America's southeastern coast, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León, who had accompanied Columbus's second voyage, visited and named in 1513 *La Florida*.[89] As the colonial period unfolded, Spain, England, and France appropriated and claimed extensive territories in North America eastern and southern coastlines. Spain established permanent settlements on the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola and Cuba in the 1490s, building cities, putting the resident indigenous populations to work, raising crops for Spanish settlers and panning gold to enrich the Spaniards. Much of the indigenous population died due to disease and overwork, spurring the Spaniards on to claim new lands and peoples. An expedition under the command of Spanish settler, Hernán Cortés, sailed westward in 1519 to what turned out to be the mainland in Mexico. With local indigenous allies, the Spanish conquered the Aztec empire in central Mexico in 1521. Spain then established permanent cities in Mexico, Central America, and Spanish South America in the sixteenth century. Once Spaniards conquered the high civilization of the Aztecs and Incas, the Caribbean was a backwater of the Spanish empire.\n\n\nOther European powers began to intrude on areas claimed by Spain, including the Caribbean islands. France took the western half of Hispaniola and developed Saint-Domingue as a cane sugar producing colony worked by black slave labor. Britain took Barbados and Jamaica, and the Dutch and Danes took islands previously claimed by Spain. Britain did not begin settling on the North American mainland until a hundred years after the first Spanish settlements, since it sought first to control nearby Ireland.\n\n\n\n### English settlements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British America\n\nThe first permanent English settlement was in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, followed by additional colonial establishments on the east coast from present-day Georgia in the south to Massachusetts in the north, forming the Thirteen Colonies of British America. The English did not establish settlements north or east of the St. Lawrence Valley in present-day Canada until after the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War. Britain's early settlements in present-day Canada included St. John's, Newfoundland in 1630 and Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1749. The first permanent French settlement was in Quebec City, Quebec in 1608\n\n\n\n### Seven Years' War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seven Years' War\n\nWith the British victory in the Seven Years' War, France in 1763 ceded to Britain its claims of North American territories east of the Mississippi River. Spain, in turn, gained rights to the territories west of Mississippi, which then served as a border between Spain and Britain's territorial claims. French colonists settled Illinois Country after several generations of experience on North America, migrating over the Mississippi River to regions where Spain was not present and where they were able to leverage their earlier Louisiana French settlements around the Gulf of Mexico. These early French settlers partnered with midwest indigenous tribes, and their mixed ancestry descendants later followed a westward expansion all the way to the Pacific Ocean on the present-day U.S. West Coast.\n\n\n\n### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American Revolution and American Revolutionary War\n\nIn 1776, after various attempts to reconcile differences with the British, the Thirteen Colonies in British America sent delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, who unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, a member of the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring it. In the Declaration, the thirteen colonies declared their independence from the British monarchy, then governed by King George III, and detailed the factors that contributed to their decision. With the signing and issuance of the Declaration of Independence, the thirteen colonies formalized and escalated the American Revolutionary War, which had begun the year before at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Gathered in Philadelphia following the war's outbreak, delegates from the thirteen colonies established the Continental Army from various patriot militias then engaged in resisting the British, and appointed George Washington as the Continental Army's military commander.\n\n\nAs the American Revolutionary War progressed, France and Spain, both then enemies of Britain, began to ultimately see the promise of a potential American victory in the war and began supporting Washington and the American Revolutionary cause. The British Army, in turn, was supported by Hessian military units from present-day Germany.\n\n\nIn 1783, after an eight-year attempt to defeat the American rebellion, King George III acknowledged Britain's defeat in the war, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783, which solidified the sovereign establishment of the United States.\n\n\n\n### Westward expansion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Westward Expansion Trails\n\nFurther information: Lewis and Clark Expedition, Louisiana Purchase, and United States Exploring Expedition\n\nBy the late 18th century, Russia was established on the Pacific Northwest northern coastline, where it was engaged in maritime fur trade and was supported by various indigenous settlements in the region. As a result, the Spanish were showing more interest in controlling the trade on the Pacific coast and mapped most of its coastline. The first Spanish settlements were attempted in Alta California during that period. Numerous overland explorations associated with voyageurs, fur trade, and U.S. led expeditions, including the Lewis and Clark, Fremont and Wilkes expeditions, reached the Pacific.\n\n\nIn 1803, during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, Napoleon Bonaparte sold France's remaining North American territorial claims, which included regions west of the Mississippi River, to the U.S., in the Louisiana Purchase. Spain and the U.S. settled their western boundary dispute in 1819 in the Adams–Onís Treaty. Mexico fought a lengthy war for independence from Spain, winning it for Mexico (which included Central America at the time) in 1821. The U.S. sought further westward expansion and fought the Mexican–American War, gaining a vast territory that first Spain and then Mexico claimed but which they did not effectively control. Much of the area was in fact dominated by indigenous peoples, which did not recognize the claims of Spain, France, or the U.S. Russia sold its North American claims, which included the present-day U.S. state of Alaska, to the U.S. in 1867.\n\n\n\n### Canada and Panama Canal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Canada and Panama Canal\n\nIn 1867, colonial settlers north of the United States, unified as the dominion of Canada. The U.S. sought to dig a canal across the Isthmus of Panama in present-day Panama in Central America, then a part of present-day Colombia. The U.S. aided Panamanians in a war that resulted in its separation from Colombia. The U.S. subsequently carved out the Panama Canal Zone, and claimed sovereignty over it. After decades of work, the Panama Canal was completed, which connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in 1913 and greatly facilitated global shipping navigation.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of North American countries by population and List of North American countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Non-native nations' control and claims over North America, c. 1750 to 2008\nCanada and the United States are the wealthiest and most developed nations on the continent followed by Mexico, a newly industrialized country.[90] The countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of economic and human development. For example, small Caribbean island-nations, such as Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Antigua and Barbuda, have a higher GDP (PPP) per capita than Mexico due to their smaller populations. Panama and Costa Rica have a significantly higher Human Development Index and GDP than the rest of the Central American nations.[91] Additionally, despite Greenland's vast resources in oil and minerals, much of them remain untapped, and the island is economically dependent on fishing, tourism, and subsidies from Denmark. Nevertheless, the island is highly developed.[92]\n\n\nDemographically, North America is ethnically diverse. Its three main groups are Whites, Mestizos and Blacks.[93] There is a significant minority of Indigenous Americans and Asians among other less numerous groups.[93]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of North America\n\n![](image)Native languages of the United States, Canada, Greenland, and Northern Mexico\nThe dominant languages in North America are English, Spanish, and French. Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside Greenlandic, and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the Dutch Caribbean. The term Anglo-America is used to refer to the anglophone countries of the Americas: namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the U.S., but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially the Commonwealth Caribbean. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the U.S.) where the Romance languages, derived from Latin, of Spanish and Portuguese, (but French-speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana [France], and the Falkland Islands [UK]).\n\n\nThe French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the Province of Quebec, where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and it is co-official with English in the Province of New Brunswick. Other French-speaking locales include the Province of Ontario (the official language is English, but there are an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the Province of Manitoba (co-official as *de jure* with English), the French West Indies and Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, as well as the U.S. state of Louisiana, where French is also an official language. Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both Creole and French. Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the Commonwealth of Dominica alongside English.\n\n\nA significant number of Indigenous languages are spoken in North America, with 372,000 people in the U.S. speaking an indigenous language at home,[94] about 225,000 in Canada[95] and roughly 6 million in Mexico.[96] In the U.S. and Canada, there are approximately 150 surviving indigenous languages of the 300 spoken prior to European contact.[97]\n\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in North America\n\nSee also: Religions of the world\n\n![](image)The percentage of people who identify with a religion in North America, according to 2010–2012 data\nChristianity is the largest religion in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, 77% of the population considered themselves Christians.[98] Christianity also is the predominant religion in the 23 dependent territories in North America.[99] The U.S. has the largest Christian population in the world, with nearly 247 million Christians (70%), although other countries have higher percentages of Christians among their populations.[100] Mexico has the world's second largest number of Catholics, surpassed only by Brazil.[101]\n\n\nAccording to the same study, the religiously unaffiliated (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 17% of the population of Canada and the U.S.[102] Those with no religious affiliation make up about 24% of Canada's total population.[103]\n\n\nCanada, the U.S. and Mexico host communities of Jews (6 million or about 1.8%),[104] Buddhists (3.8 million or 1.1%)[105] and Muslims (3.4 million or 1.0%).[106] The largest number of Jews can be found in the U.S. (5.4 million),[107] Canada (375,000)[108] and Mexico (67,476).[109] The U.S. hosts the largest Muslim population in North America with 2.7 million or 0.9%,[110][111] while Canada hosts about one million Muslims or 3.2% of the population.[112] In Mexico there were 3,700 Muslims in 2010.[113] In 2012, *U-T San Diego* estimated U.S. practitioners of Buddhism at 1.2 million people, of whom 40% are living in Southern California.[114]\n\n\nThe predominant religion in Mexico and Central America is Christianity (96%).[115] Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Mexico in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was the only religion permitted by Spanish crown and Catholic church. A vast campaign of religious conversion, the so-called \"spiritual conquest\", was launched to bring the indigenous peoples into the Christian fold. The Inquisition was established to assure orthodox belief and practice. The Catholic Church remained an important institution, so that even after political independence, Roman Catholicism remained the dominant religion. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly Protestantism, as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion. Christianity is also the predominant religion in the Caribbean (85%).[115] Other religious groups in the region are Hinduism, Islam, Rastafari (in Jamaica), and Afro-American religions such as Santería and Vodou.\n\n\n\n### Populace[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of North American countries by population, List of North American cities by population, and List of North American metropolitan areas by population\n\nNorth American cities\n![](image)\nMexico City\n![](image)\nLos Angeles\n![](image)\nToronto\n![](image)\nChicago\n![](image)\nNew York City\n![](image)\nGuadalajara\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in North America in 2021\nNorth America is the fourth most populous continent after Asia, Africa, and Europe.[116] Its most populous country is the U.S. with 329.7 million persons. The second largest country is Mexico with a population of 112.3 million.[117] Canada is the third most populous country with 37.0 million.[118] The majority of Caribbean island-nations have national populations under a million, though Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico (a territory of the U.S.), Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago each have populations higher than a million.[119][120][121][122][123] Greenland has a small population of 55,984 for its massive size (2,166,000 km2 or 836,300 mi2), and therefore, it has the world's lowest population density at 0.026 pop./km2 (0.067 pop./mi2).[124]\n\n\nWhile the U.S., Canada, and Mexico maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York City. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles, Toronto,[125] Chicago, Havana, Santo Domingo, and Montreal. Cities in the Sun Belt regions of the U.S., such as those in Southern California and Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Atlanta, and Las Vegas, are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of Baby Boomers, large industry, and the influx of immigrants. Cities near the U.S. border, particularly in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable is Tijuana, a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of water shortages.[126]\n\n\nEight of the top ten metropolitan areas are located in the U.S. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 5.5 million and include the New York City metropolitan area, Los Angeles metropolitan area, Chicago metropolitan area, and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.[127] Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within the U.S., Mexico is host to the largest metropolitan area by population in North America: Greater Mexico City.[128] Canada also breaks into the top ten largest metropolitan areas with the Toronto metropolitan area having six million people.[129] The proximity of cities to each other on the Canada–United States border and the Mexico–U.S. border has led to the rise of international metropolitan areas. These urban agglomerations are observed at their largest and most productive in Detroit–Windsor and San Diego–Tijuana and experience large commercial, economic, and cultural activity. The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight. In Detroit-Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study in 2004 concluded US$13 billion was dependent on the Detroit–Windsor international border crossing while in San Diego-Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was valued at US$20 billion.[130][131]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Megaregions of the United States\n\nNorth America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. In the U.S. exists eleven megaregions that transcend international borders and comprise Canadian and Mexican metropolitan regions. These are the Arizona Sun Corridor, Cascadia, Florida, Front Range, Great Lakes Megalopolis, Gulf Coast, Northeast, Northern California, Piedmont Atlantic, Southern California, and the Texas Triangle.[132] Canada and Mexico are also the home of megaregions. These include the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, Golden Horseshoe—both of which are considered part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis—and the Central Mexico megalopolis. Traditionally the largest megaregion has been considered the Boston-Washington, DC Corridor, or the Northeast, as the region is one massive contiguous area. Yet megaregion criterion have allowed the Great Lakes Megalopolis to maintain status as the most populated region, being home to 53,768,125 people in 2000.[133]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top ten largest North American metropolitan areas by population as of 2013, based on national census numbers from the U.S. and census estimates from Canada and Mexico\n| **Metro Area** | **Population** | **Area** | **Country** |\n| Mexico City | 21,163,226† | 7,346 km2 (2,836 sq mi)\n | Mexico\n |\n| New York City | 19,949,502\n | 17,405 km2 (6,720 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Los Angeles | 13,131,431\n | 12,562 km2 (4,850 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Chicago | 9,537,289\n | 24,814 km2 (9,581 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Dallas–Fort Worth | 6,810,913\n | 24,059 km2 (9,289 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Houston | 6,313,158\n | 26,061 km2 (10,062 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Toronto | 6,054,191† | 5,906 km2 (2,280 sq mi)\n | Canada\n |\n| Philadelphia | 6,034,678\n | 13,256 km2 (5,118 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Washington, DC | 5,949,859\n | 14,412 km2 (5,565 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Miami | 5,828,191\n | 15,896 km2 (6,137 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n\n\n†2011 Census figures\n\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of North America\n\nSee also: List of North American countries by GDP (nominal) and List of North American countries by GDP (PPP)\n\n![](image)Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sign the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement during the 2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit\n![](image)The regions of the world respective wealth (in trillions USD) as of 2018\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country or territory\n | GDP[134] (PPP, peak year)millions of USD | Peak year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States | 26,949,643 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Mexico | 3,277,601 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Canada | 2,378,973 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Dominican Republic | 273,703 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Cuba | 254,865 | 2015\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Guatemala | 201,365 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Panama | 190,306 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Costa Rica | 141,527 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Puerto Rico | 132,052 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Honduras | 75,030 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country or territory\n | GDP (nominal, peak year)millions of USD | Peak year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States | 26,949,643 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Canada[135] | 2,139,840 | 2022\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Mexico | 1,811,468 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Cuba[136] | 545,218 | 2021\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Dominican Republic | 120,629 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Puerto Rico | 117,515 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Guatemala | 102,765 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Costa Rica | 85,590 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Panama | 82,348 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) El Salvador | 35,339 | 2023\n |\n\n\nNorth America's GDP per capita was evaluated in October 2016 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be $41,830, making it the richest continent in the world,[137] followed by Oceania.[138]\n\n\nCanada, Mexico, and the U.S. have significant and multifaceted economic systems. The U.S. has the largest economy of all three countries and in the world.[138] In 2016, the U.S. had an estimated per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $57,466 according to the World Bank, and is the most technologically developed economy of the three.[139] The U.S.'s services sector comprises 77% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 22% and agriculture comprises 1.2%.[138] The U.S. economy is also the fastest growing economy in North America and the Americas as a whole,[140][137] with the highest GDP per capita in the Americas as well.[137]\n\n\nCanada shows significant growth in the sectors of services, mining and manufacturing.[141] Canada's per capita GDP (PPP) was estimated at $44,656 and it had the 11th largest GDP (nominal) in 2014.[141] Canada's services sector comprises 78% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 20% and agriculture comprises 2%.[141] Mexico has a per capita GDP (PPP) of $16,111 and as of 2014 is the 15th largest GDP (nominal) in the world.[142] Being a newly industrialized country,[90] Mexico maintains both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations.[143] Its main sources of income are oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial services.[144]\n\n\nThe North American economy is well defined and structured in three main economic areas.[145] These areas are those under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), and the Central American Common Market (CACM).[145] Of these trade blocs, the U.S. takes part in two. In addition to the larger trade blocs there is the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement among numerous other free-trade relations, often between the larger, more developed countries and Central American and Caribbean countries.\n\n\nNAFTA formed one of the four largest trade blocs in the world.[146] Its implementation in 1994 was designed for economic homogenization with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign investment between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.[147] While Canada and the U.S. already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship—and to present day still do—in the world and Canada–U.S. trade relations already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs,[148] NAFTA allowed Mexico to experience a similar duty-free trade. The free-trade agreement allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously been in place on U.S.–Mexico trade. Trade volume has steadily increased annually and in 2010, surface trade between the three NAFTA nations reached an all-time historical increase of 24.3% or US$791 billion.[149] The NAFTA trade bloc GDP (PPP) is the world's largest with US$17.617 trillion.[150] This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the U.S. is the world's largest national economy; the country had a nominal GDP of approximately $14.7 trillion in 2010.[151] The countries of NAFTA are also some of each other's largest trade partners. The U.S. is the largest trade partner of Canada and Mexico,[152] while Canada and Mexico are each other's third largest trade partners.[153][154] In 2018, the NAFTA was replaced by the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement.\n\n\nThe Caribbean trade bloc (CARICOM) came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion. CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a common passport for associated nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on free-trade agreements and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations free-trade agreements have been signed into effect.\n\n\nIntegration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation. The 2006 implementation of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) left the future of the CACM unclear.[155] The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA. In addition to the U.S., Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs.\n\n\nThese nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the G3 Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The U.S. has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the Transatlantic Free Trade Area between itself and the European Union; the U.S.–Middle East Free Trade Area between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership between Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in North America\n\n![](image)A 2006 map of the North American Class I railroad network\nThe Pan-American Highway route in the Americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly 48,000 km (30,000 mi) in length which travels through the mainland nations. No definitive length of the Pan-American Highway exists because the U.S. and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the U.S. border. However, the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly 26,000 km (16,000 mi).\n\n\nThe first transcontinental railroad in the U.S. was built in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern U.S. with California on the Pacific coast. Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous golden spike event at Promontory Summit, Utah, it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the American West, catalyzing the transition from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system.[156] Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern U.S. railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian Grand Trunk Railway had, by 1867, already accumulated more than 2,055 km (1,277 mi) of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as Port Huron, Michigan, through Sarnia, Ontario.\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\nA shared telephone system known as the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is an integrated telephone numbering plan of 24 countries and territories: the U.S. and its territories, Canada, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean nations.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baseball is known as the national pastime of the United States, and is also played in Canada and many Latin American countries.\nThe cultures of North America are diverse. The U.S. and English Canada have many cultural similarities, while French Canada has a distinct culture from Anglophone Canada, which is protected by law. Since the U.S. was formed from portions previously part of the Spanish Empire and then independent Mexico, and there has been considerable and continuing immigration of Spanish speakers from south of the U.S.–Mexico border. In the southwest of the U.S. there are many Hispanic cultural traditions and considerable bilingualism. Mexico and Central America are part of Latin America and are culturally distinct from anglophone and francophone North America. However, they share with the United States the establishment of post-independence governments that are federated representative republics with written constitutions dating from their founding as nations. Canada is a federated parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy.\n\n\nCanada's constitution dates to 1867, with confederation, in the British North America Act, but not until 1982 did Canada have the power to amend its own constitution. Canada's Francophone heritage has been enshrined in law since the British parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774. In contrast to largely Protestant Anglo settlers in North America, French-speaking Canadians were Catholic and with the Quebec Act were guaranteed freedom to practice their religion, restored the right of the Catholic Church to impose tithes for its support, and established French civil law in most circumstances.\n\n\nThe distinctiveness of French language and culture has been codified in Canadian law, so that both English and French are designated official languages. The U.S. has no official language, but its national language is English.\n\n\nThe Canadian government took action to protect Canadian culture by limiting non-Canadian content in broadcasting, creating the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission to monitor Canadian content. In Quebec, the provincial government established the Quebec Office of the French Language, often called the \"language police\" by Anglophones, which mandates the use of French terminology and signage in French.[157] Since 1968 the unicameral legislature has been called the Quebec National Assembly. Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, 24 June, is the national holiday of Quebec and celebrated by francophone Canadians throughout Canada. In Quebec, the school system was divided into Catholic and Protestant, so-called confessional schools. Anglophone education in Quebec has been increasingly undermined.[158]\n\n\nLatino culture is strong in the southwest of the U.S., as well as Florida, which draws Latin Americans from many countries in the hemisphere. Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and Mexicali, is strongly influenced by the culture and way of life of the U.S. Monterrey, a modern city with a significant industrial group, has been regarded as the most Americanized city in Mexico.[159] Northern Mexico, the Western U.S. and Alberta, Canada share a cowboy culture.\n\n\nThe Anglophone Caribbean states have witnessed and participated in the decline of the British Empire and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America in the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, and also because many of them now have more people living abroad than those remaining at home.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGreenland has experienced many immigration waves from Northern Canada, e.g. the Thule people. Therefore, Greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous peoples of Canada. Greenland is also considered Nordic and has strong Danish ties due to centuries of colonization by Denmark.[160]\n\n\n\n### Popular culture – sports[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. and Canada have major sports teams that compete against each other, including baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer/football. Canada, Mexico and the U.S. will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nThe following table shows the most prominent sports leagues in North America, in order of average revenue.[161][162] Canada has a separate Canadian Football League from the U.S. teams.\n\n\nThe Native American game of lacrosse is considered a national sport in Canada. Curling is an important winter sport in Canada, and the Winter Olympics includes it in the roster. The English sport of cricket is popular in parts of anglophone Canada and very popular in parts of the former British empire, but in Canada is considered a minor sport. Boxing is also a major sport in some countries, such as Mexico, Panama and Puerto Rico, and it is considered one of the main individual sports in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n| League | Sport | Primarycountry | Founded | Teams | RevenueUS$ (bn) | Averageattendance\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| National Football League (NFL) | American football | United States | 1920 | 32 | $9.0 | 67,604 |\n| Major League Baseball (MLB) | Baseball | United StatesCanada | 1869 | 30 | $8.0 | 30,458 |\n| National Basketball Association (NBA) | Basketball | United StatesCanada | 1946 | 30 | $5.0 | 17,347 |\n| National Hockey League (NHL) | Ice hockey | United StatesCanada | 1917 | 32 | $3.3 | 17,720 |\n| Liga MX | Football (soccer) | Mexico | 1943 | 18 | $0.6 | 25,557 |\n| Major League Soccer (MLS) | Football (soccer) | United StatesCanada | 1994 | 28 | $0.5 | 21,574 |\n| Canadian Football League (CFL) | Canadian football | Canada | 1958 | 9 | $0.3 | 23,890 |\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Flags of North America\n* List of cities in North America\n* North American Union\n* Outline of North America\n* Table manners in North America\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** This North American density figure is based on a total land area of 23,090,542 km2 only, considerably less than the total combined land and water area of 24,709,000 km2.\n2. **^** Many Western countries view the Americas as a single continent, comprising North and South America.\n3. **^** The Aleutian Islands of Alaska extend into the Eastern Hemisphere.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Depending on the definition, Panama could be considered a transcontinental country while the ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao) and Trinidad and Tobago could be considered either parts of North America or South America.\n5. **^** Since the Lucayan Archipelago is located in the Atlantic Ocean rather than Caribbean Sea, The Bahamas are part of the West Indies but are not technically part of the Caribbean, although the United Nations groups them with the Caribbean.\n6. **^** Panama is generally considered a North American country, though some authorities divide it at the Panama Canal.

The region includes Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Central America, Greenland, Mexico, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and the United States.\n\n\nNorth America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), representing approximately 16.5% of the Earth's land area and 4.8% of its total surface area. It is the third-largest continent by size after Asia and Africa, and the fourth-largest continent by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. As of 2013[update], North America's population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's population. In human geography and in the English-speaking world outside the United States, particularly in Canada, the terms \"North America\" and \"North American\" are typically defined as including just Canada and the United States.[6][7][8][9][10]\n\n\nThe first human populations reached North America during the Last Glacial Period approximately 20,000 to 17,000 years ago, during which they crossed the Bering land bridge in the Bering Strait on their way to reaching North America. The Paleo-Indian period in North America followed the Last Glacial Period, and lasted until about 10,000 years ago when the Archaic period began. The classic stage followed the Archaic period, and lasted from approximately the 6th to 13th centuries. Beginning in 1000 AD, the Norse were the first Europeans to begin exploring and ultimately colonizing areas of North America.\n\n\nIn 1492, the exploratory voyages of Christopher Columbus led to a transatlantic exchange, including migrations of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the early modern period. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists, indigenous peoples, African slaves, immigrants from Europe, Asia, and descendants of these respective groups.\n\n\nEurope's colonization in North America led to most North Americans speaking European languages, such as English, Spanish, and French, and the cultures of the region commonly reflect Western traditions. However, relatively small parts of North America in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America have indigenous populations that continue adhering to their respective pre-European colonial cultural and linguistic traditions.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information: Naming of the Americas, New Spain, Turtle Island (Native American folklore), and Vinland\n\n![](image)A 1621 map of North America\nThe Americas were named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by German cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann.[11] Vespucci explored South America between 1497 and 1502, and was the first European to suggest that the Americas represented a landmass not then known to Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller published a world map, and placed the word \"America\" on the continent of present-day South America.[12] The continent north of present-day Mexico was then referred to as Parias.[13] On a 1553 world map published by Petrus Apianus,[14] North America was called \"Baccalearum\", meaning \"realm of the Cod fish\", in reference to the abundance of cod fish on the East Coast.[15]\n\n\nWaldseemüller used the Latin version of Vespucci's name, Americus Vespucius, in its feminine form of \"America\", following the examples of \"Europa\", \"Asia\", and \"Africa\". Map makers later extended the name America to North America.\n\n\nIn 1538, Gerardus Mercator used the term America on his world map of the entire Western Hemisphere.[16] On his subsequent 1569 map, Mercator called North America \"America or New India\" (*America sive India Nova*).[17]\n\n\nThe Spanish Empire called its territories in North and South America \"Las Indias\", and the name given to the state body that oversaw the region was called the Council of the Indies.\n\n\n\n## Definitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 2005 NASA satellite image of North America\nThe United Nations and its statistics division recognize North America as including three regions: Northern America, Central America, and the Caribbean.[18] \"Northern America\" is a distinct term from \"North America\", excluding Central America, which itself may or may not include Mexico. In the limited context of regional trade agreements, the term is used to reference three nations, Canada, the United States, and Mexico.\n\n\nFrance, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Greece, and the countries of Latin America use a six-continent model, with the Americas viewed as a single continent and *North America* designating a subcontinent comprising Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon (politically part of France), and often including Greenland and Bermuda.[19][20][21][22][23]\n\n\nNorth America has historically been known by other names, including Spanish North America, New Spain, and América Septentrional, the first official name given to Mexico.[24]\n\n\n\n### Regions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of regions of Canada and List of regions of the United States\n\nNorth America includes several regions and subregions, each of which have their own respective cultural, economic, and geographic regions. Economic regions include several regions formalized in 20th and 21st century trade agreements, including NAFTA between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and CAFTA between Central America, the Dominican Republic, and the United States.\n\n\nNorth America is divided linguistically and culturally into two primary regions, Anglo-America and Latin America. Anglo-America includes most of North America, Belize, and Caribbean islands with English-speaking populations, though subnational entities, including Louisiana and Quebec, have large Francophone populations; in Quebec, French is the official language.[25].\n\n\nThe southern portion of North America includes Central America and non-English speaking Caribbean nations.[26][27] The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well. In contrast to the common definition of North America, which encompasses the whole North American continent, the term \"North America\" is sometimes used more narrowly to refer only to four nations, Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and the U.S.[28][29][30][31][32]\n\n\nThe term Northern America refers to the northernmost countries and territories of North America: the U.S., Bermuda, Canada, Greenland, and St. Pierre and Miquelon.[33][34] Although the term does not refer to a unified region,[35] Middle America includes Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.[36]\n\n\nNorth America's largest countries by land area are Canada and the U.S., both of which have well-defined and recognized subregions. In Canada, these include (from east to west) Atlantic Canada, Central Canada, Canadian Prairies, the British Columbia Coast, and Northern Canada. In the U.S., they include New England, the Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic states, East North Central states, West North Central states, East South Central states, West South Central states, Mountain states, and Pacific states. The Great Lakes region and the Pacific Northwest include areas in both Canada and the U.S.\n\n\n\n### Countries, dependencies, and other territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America\n\nSource: \"Ecoregions of North America\".

The Gulf of Mexico is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by Hudson Bay. Others include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Gulf of California.\n\n\nBefore the Central American isthmus formed, the region had been underwater. The islands of the West Indies delineate a submerged former land bridge, which had connected North and South America via what are now Florida and Venezuela.\n\n\nThere are several islands off the continent's coasts; principally, the Arctic Archipelago, the Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, the Greater and Lesser Antilles, the Aleutian Islands (some of which are in the Eastern Hemisphere proper), the Alexander Archipelago, the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast, and Newfoundland. Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, and the world's largest, is on the same tectonic plate (the North American Plate) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island that was formed on the fissure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge over 100 million years ago (mya). The nearest landmass to it is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. However, Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to Virginia and other parts of the continent.\n\n\nThe vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts of western Mexico, including Baja California, and of California, including the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles, and Santa Cruz, lie on the eastern edge of the Pacific Plate, with the two plates meeting along the San Andreas fault. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the Caribbean Plate, whereas the Juan de Fuca and Cocos plates border the North American Plate on its western frontier.\n\n\nThe continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the Great Plains stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian Arctic; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, California and Alaska; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long plateaus and cordilleras, falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.\n\n\nThe western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the coast ranges in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts—in between. The highest peak is Denali in Alaska.\n\n\nThe U.S. Geographical Survey (USGS) states that the geographic center of North America is \"6 miles [10 km] west of Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota\" at about 48°10′N 100°10′W﻿ / ﻿48.167°N 100.167°W﻿ / 48.167; -100.167, about 24 kilometers (15 mi) from Rugby, North Dakota. The USGS further states that \"No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the 50 states, the conterminous United States, or the North American continent.\"[51] Nonetheless, there is a 4.6-meter (15 ft) field stone obelisk in Rugby claiming to mark the center. The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is located 1,650 km (1,030 mi) from the nearest coastline, between Allen and Kyle, South Dakota at 43°22′N 101°58′W﻿ / ﻿43.36°N 101.97°W﻿ / 43.36; -101.97﻿ (Pole of Inaccessibility North America).[52]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of North America\n\n#### Geologic history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The principal water divisions in Canada, the United States, and Mexico\nLaurentia is an ancient craton which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the Proterozoic eon.[53] The Canadian Shield is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea, with Eurasia to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains, which formed some 480 mya, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 mya, North America became part of Laurasia, before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-Cretaceous period.[54] The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny, between 80 and 55 mya. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 mya,[55] and the Great Lakes (as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.\n\n\nNorth America is the source of much of what humanity knows about geologic time periods.[56] The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of dinosaurs than any other modern country.[56] According to paleontologist Peter Dodson, this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, and history.[56] Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent.[56] The most significant Late Jurassic dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in North America is the Morrison Formation of the western U.S.[57]\n\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canada\n\n![](image)A geologic map of North America published by the U.S. Geographical Survey\nCanada is geographically one of the oldest regions in the world, with more than half of the region consisting of Precambrian rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era.[58] Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive.[58] Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic,[59] making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield, there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.[60] The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States\n\nThe lower 48 U.S. states can be divided into roughly five physiographic provinces:\n\n\n\n1. The American cordillera\n2. The Canadian Shield[58] Northern portion of the upper midwestern U.S.\n3. The stable platform\n4. The coastal plain\n5. The Appalachian orogenic belt\n\n\nThe geology of Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera, while the major islands of Hawaii consist of Neogene volcanics erupted over a hot spot.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA 2003 image of North America's bedrock and terrain\n![](image)\nA 2015 map of North America's cratons and basement rocks\n\n#### Central America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Central America\n\n![](image)Central America rests on the Caribbean Plate.\nCentral America is geologically active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a major earthquake, killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one earthquake devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in Honduras a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009.\n\n\nVolcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in agriculturally productive highland areas.\n\n\nCentral America has many mountain ranges; the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia, and the Cordillera de Talamanca. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact, most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans, and other crops.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Köppen climate classification map of North America\nNorth America is a very large continent that extends from north of the Arctic Circle to south of the Tropic of Cancer. Greenland, along with the Canadian Shield, is tundra with average temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 °C (50 to 68 °F), but central Greenland is composed of a very large ice sheet. This tundra radiates throughout Canada, but its border ends near the Rocky Mountains (but still contains Alaska) and at the end of the Canadian Shield, near the Great Lakes.\nClimate west of the Cascade Range is described as being temperate weather with average precipitation 20 inches (510 millimeters).[61]\nClimate in coastal California is described to be Mediterranean, with average temperatures in cities like San Francisco ranging from 57 to 70 °F (14 to 21 °C) over the course of the year.[62]\n\n\nStretching from the East Coast to eastern North Dakota, and stretching down to Kansas, is the humid continental climate featuring intense seasons, with a large amount of annual precipitation, with places like New York City averaging 50 in (1,300 mm).[63]\nStarting at the southern border of the humid continental climate and stretching to the Gulf of Mexico (whilst encompassing the eastern half of Texas) is the humid subtropical climate. This area has the wettest cities in the contiguous U.S., with annual precipitation reaching 67 in (1,700 mm) in Mobile, Alabama.[64]\nStretching from the borders of the humid continental and subtropical climates, and going west to the Sierra Nevada, south to the southern tip of Durango, north to the border with tundra climate, the steppe/desert climates are the driest in the United States.[65] Highland climates cut from north to south of the continent, where subtropical or temperate climates occur just below the tropics, as in central Mexico and Guatemala. Tropical climates appear in the island regions and in the subcontinent's bottleneck, found in countries and states bathed by the Caribbean Sea or to the south of the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.[66] Precipitation patterns vary across the region, and as such rainforest, monsoon, and savanna types can be found, with rains and high temperatures throughout the year.\n\n\n\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(March 2015)*\n |\n\n\nSee also: List of endangered plants in North America\n\nNotable North American fauna include the bison, black bear, jaguar, cougar, prairie dog, turkey, pronghorn, raccoon, coyote, and monarch butterfly.\n\n\nNotable plants that were domesticated in North America include tobacco, maize, squash, tomato, sunflower, blueberry, avocado, cotton, chile pepper, and vanilla.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of North America\n\n### Pre-Columbian era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)A map of subsistence methods in the Americas, including North America, as of 1000 BCE Hunter-gatherers\n Simple farming societies\n Complex agricultural societies, including tribal chiefdoms and civilizations\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Americas have many creation myths by which they assert that they have been present on the land since its creation,[67] but there is no evidence that humans evolved there.[68] The specifics of the initial settlement of the Americas by ancient Asians are subject to ongoing research and discussion.[69] The traditional theory has been that hunters entered the Bering Land Bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska from 27,000 to 14,000 years ago.[70][71][h] A growing viewpoint is that the first American inhabitants sailed from Beringia some 13,000 years ago,[73] with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the Last Glacial Period, in what is known as the Late Glacial Maximum, around 12,500 years ago.[74] The oldest petroglyphs in North America date from 15,000 to 10,000 years before present.[75][i] Genetic research and anthropology indicate additional waves of migration from Asia via the Bering Strait during the Early-Middle Holocene.[77][78][79]\n\n\nPrior to the arrival of European explorers and colonists in North America, the natives of North America were divided into many different polities, ranging from small bands of a few families to large empires. They lived in several culture areas, which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones that defined the representative cultures and lifestyles of the indigenous people who lived there, including the bison hunters of the Great Plains and the farmers of Mesoamerica. Native groups also are classified by their language families, which included Athapascan and Uto-Aztecan languages. Indigenous peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture, however, and were not necessarily always allies. Anthropologists speculate that the Inuit of the high Arctic arrived in North America much later than other native groups, evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record and their replacement by the Thule people.\n\n\nDuring the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest yet discovered is the Clovis culture (c. 9550–9050 BCE) in modern New Mexico.[76] Later groups include the Mississippian culture and related Mound building cultures, found in the Mississippi River valley and the Pueblo culture of what is now the Four Corners. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world, such as tomatoes, squash, and maize. As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many other cultural advances were made there. The Mayans developed a writing system, built huge pyramids and temples, had a complex calendar, and developed the concept of zero around 400 CE.[80]\n\n\nThe first recorded European references to North America are in Norse sagas where it is referred to as Vinland.[81] The earliest verifiable instance of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact by any European culture with the North America mainland has been dated to around 1000 CE.[82] The site, situated at the northernmost extent of the island named Newfoundland, has provided unmistakable evidence of Norse settlement.[83] Norse explorer Leif Erikson (c. 970–1020 CE) is thought to have visited the area.[j] Erikson was the first European to make landfall on the continent (excluding Greenland).[85][86]\n\n\nThe Mayan culture was still present in southern Mexico and Guatemala when the Spanish conquistadors arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire, whose capital city Tenochtitlan was located further north in the Valley of Mexico. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by Hernán Cortés.[87]\n\n\n\n### Post-contact, 1492–1910[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European colonization of the Americas\n\nFurther information: Timeline of the European colonization of North America, British America, French America, New Spain, and Russian colonization of the Americas\n\n![](image)A 1702 map of North America showing forts, towns, and (in solid colors) areas occupied by European colonial settlements\nDuring the so-called Age of Discovery, Europeans explored overseas and staked claims to various parts of North America, much of which was already settled by indigenous peoples. Upon Europeans' arrival in the \"New World\", indigenous peoples had a variety of reactions, including curiosity, trading, cooperation, resignation, and resistance. The indigenous population declined substantially following European arrival, primarily due to the introduction of Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox, to which the indigenous peoples lacked immunity, and because of violent conflicts with Europeans.[88] Indigenous culture changed significantly and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic groups died out, and others changed quite quickly.\n\n\nOn the North America's southeastern coast, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León, who had accompanied Columbus's second voyage, visited and named in 1513 *La Florida*.[89] As the colonial period unfolded, Spain, England, and France appropriated and claimed extensive territories in North America eastern and southern coastlines. Spain established permanent settlements on the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola and Cuba in the 1490s, building cities, putting the resident indigenous populations to work, raising crops for Spanish settlers and panning gold to enrich the Spaniards. Much of the indigenous population died due to disease and overwork, spurring the Spaniards on to claim new lands and peoples. An expedition under the command of Spanish settler, Hernán Cortés, sailed westward in 1519 to what turned out to be the mainland in Mexico. With local indigenous allies, the Spanish conquered the Aztec empire in central Mexico in 1521. Spain then established permanent cities in Mexico, Central America, and Spanish South America in the sixteenth century. Once Spaniards conquered the high civilization of the Aztecs and Incas, the Caribbean was a backwater of the Spanish empire.\n\n\nOther European powers began to intrude on areas claimed by Spain, including the Caribbean islands. France took the western half of Hispaniola and developed Saint-Domingue as a cane sugar producing colony worked by black slave labor. Britain took Barbados and Jamaica, and the Dutch and Danes took islands previously claimed by Spain. Britain did not begin settling on the North American mainland until a hundred years after the first Spanish settlements, since it sought first to control nearby Ireland.\n\n\n\n### English settlements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British America\n\nThe first permanent English settlement was in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, followed by additional colonial establishments on the east coast from present-day Georgia in the south to Massachusetts in the north, forming the Thirteen Colonies of British America. The English did not establish settlements north or east of the St. Lawrence Valley in present-day Canada until after the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War. Britain's early settlements in present-day Canada included St. John's, Newfoundland in 1630 and Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1749. The first permanent French settlement was in Quebec City, Quebec in 1608\n\n\n\n### Seven Years' War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seven Years' War\n\nWith the British victory in the Seven Years' War, France in 1763 ceded to Britain its claims of North American territories east of the Mississippi River. Spain, in turn, gained rights to the territories west of Mississippi, which then served as a border between Spain and Britain's territorial claims. French colonists settled Illinois Country after several generations of experience on North America, migrating over the Mississippi River to regions where Spain was not present and where they were able to leverage their earlier Louisiana French settlements around the Gulf of Mexico. These early French settlers partnered with midwest indigenous tribes, and their mixed ancestry descendants later followed a westward expansion all the way to the Pacific Ocean on the present-day U.S. West Coast.\n\n\n\n### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American Revolution and American Revolutionary War\n\nIn 1776, after various attempts to reconcile differences with the British, the Thirteen Colonies in British America sent delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, who unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, a member of the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring it. In the Declaration, the thirteen colonies declared their independence from the British monarchy, then governed by King George III, and detailed the factors that contributed to their decision. With the signing and issuance of the Declaration of Independence, the thirteen colonies formalized and escalated the American Revolutionary War, which had begun the year before at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Gathered in Philadelphia following the war's outbreak, delegates from the thirteen colonies established the Continental Army from various patriot militias then engaged in resisting the British, and appointed George Washington as the Continental Army's military commander.\n\n\nAs the American Revolutionary War progressed, France and Spain, both then enemies of Britain, began to ultimately see the promise of a potential American victory in the war and began supporting Washington and the American Revolutionary cause. The British Army, in turn, was supported by Hessian military units from present-day Germany.\n\n\nIn 1783, after an eight-year attempt to defeat the American rebellion, King George III acknowledged Britain's defeat in the war, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783, which solidified the sovereign establishment of the United States.\n\n\n\n### Westward expansion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Westward Expansion Trails\n\nFurther information: Lewis and Clark Expedition, Louisiana Purchase, and United States Exploring Expedition\n\nBy the late 18th century, Russia was established on the Pacific Northwest northern coastline, where it was engaged in maritime fur trade and was supported by various indigenous settlements in the region. As a result, the Spanish were showing more interest in controlling the trade on the Pacific coast and mapped most of its coastline. The first Spanish settlements were attempted in Alta California during that period. Numerous overland explorations associated with voyageurs, fur trade, and U.S. led expeditions, including the Lewis and Clark, Fremont and Wilkes expeditions, reached the Pacific.\n\n\nIn 1803, during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, Napoleon Bonaparte sold France's remaining North American territorial claims, which included regions west of the Mississippi River, to the U.S., in the Louisiana Purchase. Spain and the U.S. settled their western boundary dispute in 1819 in the Adams–Onís Treaty. Mexico fought a lengthy war for independence from Spain, winning it for Mexico (which included Central America at the time) in 1821. The U.S. sought further westward expansion and fought the Mexican–American War, gaining a vast territory that first Spain and then Mexico claimed but which they did not effectively control. Much of the area was in fact dominated by indigenous peoples, which did not recognize the claims of Spain, France, or the U.S. Russia sold its North American claims, which included the present-day U.S. state of Alaska, to the U.S. in 1867.\n\n\n\n### Canada and Panama Canal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Canada and Panama Canal\n\nIn 1867, colonial settlers north of the United States, unified as the dominion of Canada. The U.S. sought to dig a canal across the Isthmus of Panama in present-day Panama in Central America, then a part of present-day Colombia. The U.S. aided Panamanians in a war that resulted in its separation from Colombia. The U.S. subsequently carved out the Panama Canal Zone, and claimed sovereignty over it. After decades of work, the Panama Canal was completed, which connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in 1913 and greatly facilitated global shipping navigation.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of North American countries by population and List of North American countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Non-native nations' control and claims over North America, c. 1750 to 2008\nCanada and the United States are the wealthiest and most developed nations on the continent followed by Mexico, a newly industrialized country.[90] The countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of economic and human development. For example, small Caribbean island-nations, such as Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Antigua and Barbuda, have a higher GDP (PPP) per capita than Mexico due to their smaller populations. Panama and Costa Rica have a significantly higher Human Development Index and GDP than the rest of the Central American nations.[91] Additionally, despite Greenland's vast resources in oil and minerals, much of them remain untapped, and the island is economically dependent on fishing, tourism, and subsidies from Denmark. Nevertheless, the island is highly developed.[92]\n\n\nDemographically, North America is ethnically diverse. Its three main groups are Whites, Mestizos and Blacks.[93] There is a significant minority of Indigenous Americans and Asians among other less numerous groups.[93]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of North America\n\n![](image)Native languages of the United States, Canada, Greenland, and Northern Mexico\nThe dominant languages in North America are English, Spanish, and French. Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside Greenlandic, and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the Dutch Caribbean. The term Anglo-America is used to refer to the anglophone countries of the Americas: namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the U.S., but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially the Commonwealth Caribbean. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the U.S.) where the Romance languages, derived from Latin, of Spanish and Portuguese, (but French-speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana [France], and the Falkland Islands [UK]).\n\n\nThe French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the Province of Quebec, where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and it is co-official with English in the Province of New Brunswick. Other French-speaking locales include the Province of Ontario (the official language is English, but there are an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the Province of Manitoba (co-official as *de jure* with English), the French West Indies and Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, as well as the U.S. state of Louisiana, where French is also an official language. Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both Creole and French. Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the Commonwealth of Dominica alongside English.\n\n\nA significant number of Indigenous languages are spoken in North America, with 372,000 people in the U.S. speaking an indigenous language at home,[94] about 225,000 in Canada[95] and roughly 6 million in Mexico.[96] In the U.S. and Canada, there are approximately 150 surviving indigenous languages of the 300 spoken prior to European contact.[97]\n\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in North America\n\nSee also: Religions of the world\n\n![](image)The percentage of people who identify with a religion in North America, according to 2010–2012 data\nChristianity is the largest religion in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, 77% of the population considered themselves Christians.[98] Christianity also is the predominant religion in the 23 dependent territories in North America.[99] The U.S. has the largest Christian population in the world, with nearly 247 million Christians (70%), although other countries have higher percentages of Christians among their populations.[100] Mexico has the world's second largest number of Catholics, surpassed only by Brazil.[101]\n\n\nAccording to the same study, the religiously unaffiliated (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 17% of the population of Canada and the U.S.[102] Those with no religious affiliation make up about 24% of Canada's total population.[103]\n\n\nCanada, the U.S. and Mexico host communities of Jews (6 million or about 1.8%),[104] Buddhists (3.8 million or 1.1%)[105] and Muslims (3.4 million or 1.0%).[106] The largest number of Jews can be found in the U.S. (5.4 million),[107] Canada (375,000)[108] and Mexico (67,476).[109] The U.S. hosts the largest Muslim population in North America with 2.7 million or 0.9%,[110][111] while Canada hosts about one million Muslims or 3.2% of the population.[112] In Mexico there were 3,700 Muslims in 2010.[113] In 2012, *U-T San Diego* estimated U.S. practitioners of Buddhism at 1.2 million people, of whom 40% are living in Southern California.[114]\n\n\nThe predominant religion in Mexico and Central America is Christianity (96%).[115] Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Mexico in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was the only religion permitted by Spanish crown and Catholic church. A vast campaign of religious conversion, the so-called \"spiritual conquest\", was launched to bring the indigenous peoples into the Christian fold. The Inquisition was established to assure orthodox belief and practice. The Catholic Church remained an important institution, so that even after political independence, Roman Catholicism remained the dominant religion. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly Protestantism, as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion. Christianity is also the predominant religion in the Caribbean (85%).[115] Other religious groups in the region are Hinduism, Islam, Rastafari (in Jamaica), and Afro-American religions such as Santería and Vodou.\n\n\n\n### Populace[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of North American countries by population, List of North American cities by population, and List of North American metropolitan areas by population\n\nNorth American cities\n![](image)\nMexico City\n![](image)\nLos Angeles\n![](image)\nToronto\n![](image)\nChicago\n![](image)\nNew York City\n![](image)\nGuadalajara\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in North America in 2021\nNorth America is the fourth most populous continent after Asia, Africa, and Europe.[116] Its most populous country is the U.S. with 329.7 million persons. The second largest country is Mexico with a population of 112.3 million.[117] Canada is the third most populous country with 37.0 million.[118] The majority of Caribbean island-nations have national populations under a million, though Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico (a territory of the U.S.), Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago each have populations higher than a million.[119][120][121][122][123] Greenland has a small population of 55,984 for its massive size (2,166,000 km2 or 836,300 mi2), and therefore, it has the world's lowest population density at 0.026 pop./km2 (0.067 pop./mi2).[124]\n\n\nWhile the U.S., Canada, and Mexico maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York City. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles, Toronto,[125] Chicago, Havana, Santo Domingo, and Montreal. Cities in the Sun Belt regions of the U.S., such as those in Southern California and Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Atlanta, and Las Vegas, are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of Baby Boomers, large industry, and the influx of immigrants. Cities near the U.S. border, particularly in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable is Tijuana, a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of water shortages.[126]\n\n\nEight of the top ten metropolitan areas are located in the U.S. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 5.5 million and include the New York City metropolitan area, Los Angeles metropolitan area, Chicago metropolitan area, and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.[127] Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within the U.S., Mexico is host to the largest metropolitan area by population in North America: Greater Mexico City.[128] Canada also breaks into the top ten largest metropolitan areas with the Toronto metropolitan area having six million people.[129] The proximity of cities to each other on the Canada–United States border and the Mexico–U.S. border has led to the rise of international metropolitan areas. These urban agglomerations are observed at their largest and most productive in Detroit–Windsor and San Diego–Tijuana and experience large commercial, economic, and cultural activity. The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight. In Detroit-Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study in 2004 concluded US$13 billion was dependent on the Detroit–Windsor international border crossing while in San Diego-Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was valued at US$20 billion.[130][131]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Megaregions of the United States\n\nNorth America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. In the U.S. exists eleven megaregions that transcend international borders and comprise Canadian and Mexican metropolitan regions. These are the Arizona Sun Corridor, Cascadia, Florida, Front Range, Great Lakes Megalopolis, Gulf Coast, Northeast, Northern California, Piedmont Atlantic, Southern California, and the Texas Triangle.[132] Canada and Mexico are also the home of megaregions. These include the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, Golden Horseshoe—both of which are considered part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis—and the Central Mexico megalopolis. Traditionally the largest megaregion has been considered the Boston-Washington, DC Corridor, or the Northeast, as the region is one massive contiguous area. Yet megaregion criterion have allowed the Great Lakes Megalopolis to maintain status as the most populated region, being home to 53,768,125 people in 2000.[133]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top ten largest North American metropolitan areas by population as of 2013, based on national census numbers from the U.S. and census estimates from Canada and Mexico\n| **Metro Area** | **Population** | **Area** | **Country** |\n| Mexico City | 21,163,226† | 7,346 km2 (2,836 sq mi)\n | Mexico\n |\n| New York City | 19,949,502\n | 17,405 km2 (6,720 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Los Angeles | 13,131,431\n | 12,562 km2 (4,850 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Chicago | 9,537,289\n | 24,814 km2 (9,581 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Dallas–Fort Worth | 6,810,913\n | 24,059 km2 (9,289 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Houston | 6,313,158\n | 26,061 km2 (10,062 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Toronto | 6,054,191† | 5,906 km2 (2,280 sq mi)\n | Canada\n |\n| Philadelphia | 6,034,678\n | 13,256 km2 (5,118 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Washington, DC | 5,949,859\n | 14,412 km2 (5,565 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Miami | 5,828,191\n | 15,896 km2 (6,137 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n\n\n†2011 Census figures\n\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of North America\n\nSee also: List of North American countries by GDP (nominal) and List of North American countries by GDP (PPP)\n\n![](image)Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sign the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement during the 2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit\n![](image)The regions of the world respective wealth (in trillions USD) as of 2018\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country or territory\n | GDP[134] (PPP, peak year)millions of USD | Peak year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States | 26,949,643 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Mexico | 3,277,601 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Canada | 2,378,973 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Dominican Republic | 273,703 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Cuba | 254,865 | 2015\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Guatemala | 201,365 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Panama | 190,306 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Costa Rica | 141,527 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Puerto Rico | 132,052 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Honduras | 75,030 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country or territory\n | GDP (nominal, peak year)millions of USD | Peak year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States | 26,949,643 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Canada[135] | 2,139,840 | 2022\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Mexico | 1,811,468 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Cuba[136] | 545,218 | 2021\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Dominican Republic | 120,629 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Puerto Rico | 117,515 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Guatemala | 102,765 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Costa Rica | 85,590 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Panama | 82,348 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) El Salvador | 35,339 | 2023\n |\n\n\nNorth America's GDP per capita was evaluated in October 2016 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be $41,830, making it the richest continent in the world,[137] followed by Oceania.[138]\n\n\nCanada, Mexico, and the U.S. have significant and multifaceted economic systems. The U.S. has the largest economy of all three countries and in the world.[138] In 2016, the U.S. had an estimated per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $57,466 according to the World Bank, and is the most technologically developed economy of the three.[139] The U.S.'s services sector comprises 77% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 22% and agriculture comprises 1.2%.[138] The U.S. economy is also the fastest growing economy in North America and the Americas as a whole,[140][137] with the highest GDP per capita in the Americas as well.[137]\n\n\nCanada shows significant growth in the sectors of services, mining and manufacturing.[141] Canada's per capita GDP (PPP) was estimated at $44,656 and it had the 11th largest GDP (nominal) in 2014.[141] Canada's services sector comprises 78% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 20% and agriculture comprises 2%.[141] Mexico has a per capita GDP (PPP) of $16,111 and as of 2014 is the 15th largest GDP (nominal) in the world.[142] Being a newly industrialized country,[90] Mexico maintains both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations.[143] Its main sources of income are oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial services.[144]\n\n\nThe North American economy is well defined and structured in three main economic areas.[145] These areas are those under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), and the Central American Common Market (CACM).[145] Of these trade blocs, the U.S. takes part in two. In addition to the larger trade blocs there is the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement among numerous other free-trade relations, often between the larger, more developed countries and Central American and Caribbean countries.\n\n\nNAFTA formed one of the four largest trade blocs in the world.[146] Its implementation in 1994 was designed for economic homogenization with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign investment between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.[147] While Canada and the U.S. already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship—and to present day still do—in the world and Canada–U.S. trade relations already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs,[148] NAFTA allowed Mexico to experience a similar duty-free trade. The free-trade agreement allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously been in place on U.S.–Mexico trade. Trade volume has steadily increased annually and in 2010, surface trade between the three NAFTA nations reached an all-time historical increase of 24.3% or US$791 billion.[149] The NAFTA trade bloc GDP (PPP) is the world's largest with US$17.617 trillion.[150] This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the U.S. is the world's largest national economy; the country had a nominal GDP of approximately $14.7 trillion in 2010.[151] The countries of NAFTA are also some of each other's largest trade partners. The U.S. is the largest trade partner of Canada and Mexico,[152] while Canada and Mexico are each other's third largest trade partners.[153][154] In 2018, the NAFTA was replaced by the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement.\n\n\nThe Caribbean trade bloc (CARICOM) came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion. CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a common passport for associated nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on free-trade agreements and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations free-trade agreements have been signed into effect.\n\n\nIntegration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation. The 2006 implementation of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) left the future of the CACM unclear.[155] The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA. In addition to the U.S., Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs.\n\n\nThese nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the G3 Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The U.S. has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the Transatlantic Free Trade Area between itself and the European Union; the U.S.–Middle East Free Trade Area between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership between Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in North America\n\n![](image)A 2006 map of the North American Class I railroad network\nThe Pan-American Highway route in the Americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly 48,000 km (30,000 mi) in length which travels through the mainland nations. No definitive length of the Pan-American Highway exists because the U.S. and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the U.S. border. However, the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly 26,000 km (16,000 mi).\n\n\nThe first transcontinental railroad in the U.S. was built in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern U.S. with California on the Pacific coast. Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous golden spike event at Promontory Summit, Utah, it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the American West, catalyzing the transition from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system.[156] Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern U.S. railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian Grand Trunk Railway had, by 1867, already accumulated more than 2,055 km (1,277 mi) of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as Port Huron, Michigan, through Sarnia, Ontario.\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\nA shared telephone system known as the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is an integrated telephone numbering plan of 24 countries and territories: the U.S. and its territories, Canada, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean nations.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baseball is known as the national pastime of the United States, and is also played in Canada and many Latin American countries.\nThe cultures of North America are diverse. The U.S. and English Canada have many cultural similarities, while French Canada has a distinct culture from Anglophone Canada, which is protected by law. Since the U.S. was formed from portions previously part of the Spanish Empire and then independent Mexico, and there has been considerable and continuing immigration of Spanish speakers from south of the U.S.–Mexico border. In the southwest of the U.S. there are many Hispanic cultural traditions and considerable bilingualism. Mexico and Central America are part of Latin America and are culturally distinct from anglophone and francophone North America. However, they share with the United States the establishment of post-independence governments that are federated representative republics with written constitutions dating from their founding as nations. Canada is a federated parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy.\n\n\nCanada's constitution dates to 1867, with confederation, in the British North America Act, but not until 1982 did Canada have the power to amend its own constitution. Canada's Francophone heritage has been enshrined in law since the British parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774. In contrast to largely Protestant Anglo settlers in North America, French-speaking Canadians were Catholic and with the Quebec Act were guaranteed freedom to practice their religion, restored the right of the Catholic Church to impose tithes for its support, and established French civil law in most circumstances.\n\n\nThe distinctiveness of French language and culture has been codified in Canadian law, so that both English and French are designated official languages. The U.S. has no official language, but its national language is English.\n\n\nThe Canadian government took action to protect Canadian culture by limiting non-Canadian content in broadcasting, creating the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission to monitor Canadian content. In Quebec, the provincial government established the Quebec Office of the French Language, often called the \"language police\" by Anglophones, which mandates the use of French terminology and signage in French.[157] Since 1968 the unicameral legislature has been called the Quebec National Assembly. Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, 24 June, is the national holiday of Quebec and celebrated by francophone Canadians throughout Canada. In Quebec, the school system was divided into Catholic and Protestant, so-called confessional schools. Anglophone education in Quebec has been increasingly undermined.[158]\n\n\nLatino culture is strong in the southwest of the U.S., as well as Florida, which draws Latin Americans from many countries in the hemisphere. Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and Mexicali, is strongly influenced by the culture and way of life of the U.S. Monterrey, a modern city with a significant industrial group, has been regarded as the most Americanized city in Mexico.[159] Northern Mexico, the Western U.S. and Alberta, Canada share a cowboy culture.\n\n\nThe Anglophone Caribbean states have witnessed and participated in the decline of the British Empire and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America in the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, and also because many of them now have more people living abroad than those remaining at home.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGreenland has experienced many immigration waves from Northern Canada, e.g. the Thule people. Therefore, Greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous peoples of Canada. Greenland is also considered Nordic and has strong Danish ties due to centuries of colonization by Denmark.[160]\n\n\n\n### Popular culture – sports[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. and Canada have major sports teams that compete against each other, including baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer/football. Canada, Mexico and the U.S. will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nThe following table shows the most prominent sports leagues in North America, in order of average revenue.[161][162] Canada has a separate Canadian Football League from the U.S. teams.\n\n\nThe Native American game of lacrosse is considered a national sport in Canada. Curling is an important winter sport in Canada, and the Winter Olympics includes it in the roster. The English sport of cricket is popular in parts of anglophone Canada and very popular in parts of the former British empire, but in Canada is considered a minor sport.

It can also be described as the southern subregion of a single continent called America.\n\n\nSouth America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. The continent generally includes twelve sovereign states: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela; two dependent territories: the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands;[i] and one internal territory: French Guiana.[j] In addition, the ABC islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Ascension Island (dependency of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, a British Overseas Territory), Bouvet Island (dependency of Norway), Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago may also be considered parts of South America.\n\n\nSouth America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its population as of 2021[update] has been estimated at more than 434 million.[1][2] South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with almost half of the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru. In recent decades, Brazil has also generated half of the continent's GDP and has become the continent's first regional power.[9]\n\n\nMost of the population lives near the continent's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the far south are sparsely populated. The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes mountains; in contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and vast lowlands where rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco and Paraná flow. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of the Southern Cone located in the middle latitudes.\n\n\nThe continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of indigenous peoples with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long history of colonialism, the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak Spanish or Portuguese, and societies and states are rich in Western traditions. Relative to Europe, Asia and Africa, post-1900 South America has been a peaceful continent with few wars.[10][11][k]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of South America\n\nSee also: Category:Environment of South America\n\n![](image)A composite relief image of South America\n![](image)Modern political map of South America\nSouth America occupies the southern portion of the Americas. The continent is generally delimited on the northwest by the Darién watershed along the Colombia–Panama border, although some may consider the border instead to be the Panama Canal. Geopolitically[13] and geographically, all of Panama – including the segment east of the Panama Canal in the isthmus – is typically included in North America alone[14][15][16] and among the countries of Central America.[17][18] Almost all of mainland South America sits on the South American Plate.\n\n\nSouth America is home to several superlatives, including, the world's second highest uninterrupted waterfall, Angel Falls in Venezuela; the highest single-drop waterfall Kaieteur Falls in Guyana; the largest river by volume, the Amazon River; the longest mountain range, the Andes (whose highest mountain is Aconcagua at 6,962 m or 22,841 ft); the driest non-polar place on earth, the Atacama Desert;[19][20][21] the wettest place on earth, López de Micay in Colombia; the largest rainforest, the Amazon rainforest; the highest capital city, La Paz, Bolivia; the highest commercially navigable lake in the world, Lake Titicaca; and, excluding research stations in Antarctica, the world's southernmost permanently inhabited community, Puerto Toro, Chile.\n\n\nSouth America's major mineral resources are gold, silver, copper, iron ore, tin, and petroleum. These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export commodity often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.\n\n\nBrazil is the largest country in South America, covering a little less than half of the continent's land area and encompassing around half of the continent's population.[22] The remaining countries and territories are divided among four subregions: the Andean states, Caribbean South America, The Guianas, and the Southern Cone.[23]\n\n\n\n### Outlying islands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Gran Roque village, the largest settlement of the Los Roques Archipelago, Venezuela\nPhysiographically, South America also includes some of the nearby islands. The Dutch ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao), the islands of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad Island and Tobago Island etc.), the State of Nueva Esparta, and the Federal Dependencies of Venezuela sit on the northern portion of the South American continental shelf and are sometimes considered parts of the continent. Geopolitically, all the island countries and territories in the Caribbean have generally been grouped as a subregion of North America instead. By contrast, Aves Island (administered by Venezuela) and the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina (San Andrés Island, Providencia Island, and Santa Catalina Island etc., which are administered by Colombia) are politically parts of South American countries but physiographically parts of North America.[16][24][25]\n\n\nOther islands often associated with geopolitical South America are the Chiloé Archipelago and Robinson Crusoe Island (both administered by Chile), Easter Island (culturally a part of Oceania, also administered by Chile),[26] the Galápagos Islands (administered by Ecuador, sometimes considered part of Oceania),[26][27][28] and Tierra del Fuego (split between Argentina and Chile). In the Atlantic Ocean, Brazil administers Fernando de Noronha, Trindade and Martim Vaz, and the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, while the Falkland Islands (Spanish: *Islas Malvinas*) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (biogeographically and hydrologically associated with Antarctica)[29] have been administered as two British Overseas Territories under the Crown, whose sovereignty over the islands is disputed by Argentina.\n\n\n\n#### Special cases[edit]\n\n\nAn isolated volcanic island on the South American Plate, Ascension Island is geologically a part of South America.[30] Administered as a dependency of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, the island is geopolitically a part of Africa.\n\n\nAn uninhabited sub-Antarctic volcanic island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, Bouvet Island (administered by Norway) is geographically, geologically, biogeographically, and hydrologically associated with Antarctica, but the United Nations geoscheme has included the territory in South America instead.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for South America[31]\nAll of the world's major climate zones are present in South America.[32]\n\n\nThe distribution of the average temperatures in the region presents a constant regularity from the 30° of latitude south, when the isotherms tend, more and more, to be confused with the degrees of latitude.[33]\n\n\nIn temperate latitudes, winters and summers are milder than in North America. This is because the most extensive part of the continent is in the equatorial zone (the region has more areas of equatorial plains than any other region),[33] therefore giving the Southern Cone more oceanic influence, which moderates year round temperatures.\n\n\nThe average annual temperatures in the Amazon basin oscillate around 27 °C (81 °F), with low thermal amplitudes and high rainfall indices. Between the Maracaibo Lake and the mouth of the Orinoco, predominates an equatorial climate of the type Congolese, that also includes parts of the Brazilian territory.[33]\n\n\nThe east-central Brazilian plateau has a humid and warm tropical climate. The northern and eastern parts of the Argentine pampas have a humid subtropical climate with dry winters and humid summers of the Chinese type, while the western and eastern ranges have a subtropical climate of the dinaric type. At the highest points of the Andean region, climates are colder than the ones occurring at the highest point of the Norwegian fjords. In the Andean plateaus, the warm climate prevails, although it is tempered by the altitude, while in the coastal strip, there is an equatorial climate of the Guinean type. From this point until the north of the Chilean coast appear, successively, Mediterranean oceanic climate, temperate of the Breton type and, already in Tierra del Fuego, cold climate of the Siberian type.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of all tropical cyclone tracks from 1945 to 2006\nThe distribution of rainfall is related to the regime of winds and air masses. In most of the tropical region east of the Andes, winds blowing from the northeast, east and southeast carry moisture from the Atlantic, causing abundant rainfall. However, due to a consistently strong wind shear and a weak Intertropical Convergence Zone, South Atlantic tropical cyclones are rare.[34] In the Orinoco Llanos and in the Guianas Plateau, the precipitation levels go from moderate to high. The Pacific coast of Colombia and northern Ecuador are rainy regions, with Chocó in Colombia being the rainiest place in the world along with the northern slopes of Indian Himalayas.[35] The Atacama Desert, along this stretch of coast, is one of the driest regions in the world. The central and southern parts of Chile are subject to extratropical cyclones, and most of the Argentine Patagonia is desert. In the Pampas of Argentina, Uruguay and South of Brazil the rainfall is moderate, with rains well distributed during the year. The moderately dry conditions of the Chaco oppose the intense rainfall of the eastern region of Paraguay. In the semiarid coast of the Brazilian Northeast the rains are linked to a monsoon regime.[33]\n\n\nImportant factors in the determination of climates are sea currents, such as the current Humboldt and Falklands. The equatorial current of the South Atlantic strikes the coast of the Northeast and there is divided into two others: the current of Brazil and a coastal current that flows to the northwest towards the Antilles, where there it moves towards northeast course thus forming the most Important and famous ocean current in the world, the Gulf Stream.[33][36]\n\n\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\nSouth America is one of the most biodiverse continents on Earth. South America is home to many unique species of animals including the llama, anaconda, piranha, jaguar, vicuña, and tapir. The Amazon rainforests possess high biodiversity, with Brazil estimated to contain 10% of Earth's species.[37] 83% of South America's large mammals (megafauna) became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene around 11,000 years ago as part of the Quaternary extinction event, among the highest of any continent, with the casualties including saber-toothed cats, ground sloths, glyptodonts, gomphotheres, the equines *Hippidion* and *Equus neogeus*, and all remaining South American native ungulates.[38]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of South America\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of South America § Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)The prehistoric Cueva de las Manos, or \"Cave of the Hands\", in Argentina\nSouth America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the Bering Land Bridge (now the Bering Strait) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia. They migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the Isthmus of Panama.\n\n\nAmongst the oldest evidence for human presence in South America is the Monte Verde II site in Chile, suggested to date to around 14,500 years ago.[39] From around 13,000 years ago, the Fishtail projectile point style became widespread across South America, with its disppearance around 11,000 years ago coincident with the disappearance of South America's megafauna.[40] Maize was present in northern South America by around 6,000 years ago.[41]\n\n\nBy 2000 BC, many agrarian communities had been settled throughout the Andes and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an agrarian society.[42]\n\n\nSouth American cultures began domesticating llamas, vicuñas, guanacos, and alpacas in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.[42]\n\n\n\n### Pre-Columbian civilizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pre-Columbian era § South America\n\n![](image)The Inca estate of Machu Picchu, Peru is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\nThe rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.\n\n\nOne of the earliest known South American civilizations was at Caral-Supe, on the central Peruvian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Caral-Supe created one of the first cities of the world, generally dated to around 3500 BC, at Huaricanga in the Fortaleza area, contemporaneous with the pyramids of Ancient Egypt, one of the oldest-known civilization in the Americas and one of the six sites where civilisation separately originated in the ancient world.[43] Caral-Supe governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by Chavín by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín de Huantar in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters (10,423 ft). Chavín civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.\n\n\nIn the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, Moche (100 BC – 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), Paracas and Nazca (400 BC – 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through irrigation and new styles of ceramic art. At the Altiplano, Tiahuanaco or Tiwanaku (100 BC – 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion.\n\n\nAround the 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or Huari Empire (600–1200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and Tiahuanaco religious iconography.\n\n\nThe Muisca were the main indigenous civilization in what is now Colombia. They established the Muisca Confederation of many clans, or *cacicazgos*, that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.\n\n\nOther important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the Cañaris (in south central Ecuador), Chimú Empire (1300–1470, Peruvian northern coast), Chachapoyas, and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000–1450, Western Bolivia and southern Peru).\nHolding their capital at the great city of Cusco, the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as *Tawantin suyu*, and \"the land of the four regions,\" in Quechua, the Inca Empire was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some nine to fourteen million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer road system. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture.\n\n\nThe Mapuche in Central and Southern Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the Arauco War for more than 300 years.\n\n\n\n\n### European colonization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Spanish colonization of the Americas and Portuguese colonization of the Americas\n\n![](image)Woodcut depicting Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci's first voyage (1497–98) to the New World, from the first known published edition of Vespucci's 1504 letter to Piero Soderini\nIn 1494, Portugal and Spain, the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive duopoly between the two countries.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Inca–Spanish confrontation in the Battle of Cajamarca left thousands of natives dead.\nThe treaty established an imaginary line along a north–south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, roughly 46° 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of longitude were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian.\n\n\nBeginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign conquistadors, first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it into colonies.\n\n\nEuropean infectious diseases (smallpox, influenza, measles, and typhus) – to which the native populations had no immune resistance – caused large-scale depopulation of the native population under Spanish control. Systems of forced labor, such as the haciendas and mining industry's mit'a also contributed to the depopulation. After this, enslaved Africans, who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the Americas in 1790\nThe Spaniards were committed to converting their native subjects to Christianity and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended Catholicism with their established beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the Roman Catholic Church's evangelization in Quechua, Aymara, and Guaraní actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.\n\n\nEventually, the natives and the Spaniards interbred, forming a mestizo class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral landing in Brazil in 1500\nMany native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of Latin American.\n\n\nGuyana was initially colonized by the Dutch before coming under British control, though there was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was occupied by the French. The region was initially partitioned between the Dutch, French and British before fully coming under the control of Britain.\n\n\n\n![](image)Dutch colonial houses in Paramaribo, Suriname\nSuriname was first explored by the Spanish in the 16th century and then settled by the English in the mid-17th century. It became a Dutch colony in 1667.[45]\n\n\n\n### Slavery in South America[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas and Atlantic slave trade\n\n![](image)Public

European colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The Atlantic slave trade brought enslaved Africans primarily to South American colonies, beginning with the Portuguese since 1502.[46] The main destinations of this phase were the Caribbean colonies and Brazil, as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the New World. Nearly 40% of all African slaves trafficked to the Americas went to Brazil. An estimated 4.9 million slaves from Africa came to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.[47][48]\n\n\nIn contrast to other European colonies in the Americas which mainly used the labor of African slaves, Spanish colonists mainly enslaved indigenous Americans. In 1750, the Portuguese Crown abolished the enslavement of indigenous peoples in colonial Brazil, under the belief that they were unfit for labor and less effective than enslaved Africans. Enslaved Africans were brought to the Americas on slave ships, under inhuman conditions and ill-treatment, and those who survived were sold in slave markets.[49] After independence, all South American countries maintained slavery for some time. The first South American country to abolish slavery was Chile in 1823, Uruguay in 1830, Bolivia in 1831, Colombia and Ecuador in 1851, Argentina in 1853, Peru and Venezuela in 1854, Suriname in 1863, Paraguay in 1869, and in 1888 Brazil was the last South American nation and the last country in western world to abolish slavery.[50]\n\n\n\n### Independence from Spain and Portugal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Spanish American wars of independence and Independence of Brazil\n\nThe European Peninsular War (1807–1814), a theater of the Napoleonic Wars, changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the House of Braganza avoided capture by escaping to Brazil. Napoleon also captured King Ferdinand VII of Spain, and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created Juntas to rule in the name of the captured king.\n\n\n\n![](image)The proclamation of the Independence of Brazil by Prince Pedro on 7 September 1822\n![](image)The Guayaquil conference between José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar\n![](image)Coronation of Pedro I as 1st Emperor of Brazil\n![](image)Bernardo O'Higgins swears officially the independence of Chile.\nMany cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the Spanish American wars of independence between the patriots, who promoted such autonomy, and the royalists, who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the Enlightenment. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the Absolutist Restoration as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict.\n\n\nThe independence of South America was secured by Simón Bolívar (Venezuela) and José de San Martín (Argentina), the two most important *Libertadores*. Bolívar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards Lima, the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Meanwhile, San Martín led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.\n\n\nIn the Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil, Dom Pedro I (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King Dom João VI, proclaimed the independent Kingdom of Brazil in 1822, which later became the Empire of Brazil. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in Bahia, Cisplatina and Pará, independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal in 1825, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil mediatized by the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n### Nation-building and fragmentation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Thirty-Three Orientals proclaimed the independence of Cisplatine Province.\n![](image)Battle of Fanfa, battle scene in Southern Brazil during the Ragamuffin War\nThe newly independent nations began a process of fragmentation, with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern times (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the Republic of Entre Ríos and the Riograndense Republic).\n\n\nThe first separatist attempt was in 1820 by the Argentine province of Entre Ríos, led by a caudillo.[51] In spite of the \"Republic\" in its title, General Ramírez, its caudillo, never really intended to declare an independent Entre Rios. Rather, he was making a political statement in opposition to the monarchist and centralist ideas that back then permeated Buenos Aires politics. The \"country\" was reincorporated at the United Provinces in 1821.\n\n\nIn 1825 the Cisplatine Province declared its independence from the Empire of Brazil, which led to the Cisplatine War between the imperials and the Argentine from the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata to control the region. Three years later, the United Kingdom intervened in the question by proclaiming a tie and creating in the former Cisplatina a new independent country: The Oriental Republic of Uruguay.\n\n\nLater in 1836, while Brazil was experiencing the chaos of the regency, Rio Grande do Sul proclaimed its independence motivated by a tax crisis. With the anticipation of the coronation of Pedro II to the throne of Brazil, the country could stabilize and fight the separatists, which the province of Santa Catarina had joined in 1839. The Conflict came to an end by a process of compromise by which both Riograndense Republic and Juliana Republic were reincorporated as provinces in 1845.[52][53]\n\n\nThe Peru–Bolivian Confederation, a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the War of the Confederation (1836–1839) and again during the War of the Pacific (1879–1883). Paraguay was virtually destroyed by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay in the Paraguayan War.\n\n\n\n### Wars and conflicts[edit]\n\n\nDespite the Spanish American wars of independence and the Brazilian War of Independence, the new nations quickly began to suffer with internal conflicts and wars among themselves. Most of the 1810 borders countries had initially accepted on the *uti possidetis iuris* principle had by 1848 either been altered by war or were contested.[54]\n\n\nIn 1825 the proclamation of independence of Cisplatina led to the Cisplatine War between historical rivals the Empire of Brazil and the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Argentina's predecessor. The result was a stalemate, ending with the British government arranging for the independence of Uruguay. Soon after, another Brazilian province proclaimed its independence leading to the Ragamuffin War which Brazil won.\n\n\nBetween 1836 and 1839 the War of the Confederation broke out between the short-lived Peru-Bolivian Confederation and Chile, with the support of the Argentine Confederation. The war was fought mostly in the actual territory of Peru and ended with a Confederate defeat and the dissolution of the Confederacy and annexation of many territories by Argentina.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Argentine Civil Wars plagued Argentina since its independence. The conflict was mainly between those who defended the centralization of power in Buenos Aires and those who defended a confederation. During this period it can be said that \"there were two Argentines\": the Argentine Confederation and the Argentine Republic. At the same time, the political instability in Uruguay led to the Uruguayan Civil War among the main political factions of the country. All this instability in the platine region interfered with the goals of other countries such as Brazil, which was soon forced to take sides. In 1851 the Brazilian Empire, supporting the centralizing unitarians, and the Uruguayan government invaded Argentina and deposed the caudillo, Juan Manuel Rosas, who ruled the confederation with an iron hand. Although the Platine War did not put an end to the political chaos and civil war in Argentina, it brought temporary peace to Uruguay where the Colorados faction won, supported by Brazil, Britain, France and the Unitarian Party of Argentina.[55]\n\n\nPeace lasted only a short time: in 1864 the Uruguayan factions faced each other again in the Uruguayan War. The Blancos supported by Paraguay started to attack Brazilian and Argentine farmers near the borders. The Empire made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados without success. In 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, the imperial government declared that Brazil's military would begin reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and, for most of its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war which led to the deposition of the *Blancos* and the rise of the pro-Brazilian *Colorados* to power again. This angered the Paraguayan government, which even before the end of the war invaded Brazil, beginning the longest and bloodiest inter-state war in Latin American history: the Paraguayan War.[56]\n\n\nThe Paraguayan War began when the Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano López ordered the invasion of the Brazilian provinces of Mato Grosso and Rio Grande do Sul. His attempt to cross Argentinian territory without Argentinian approval led the pro-Brazilian Argentine government into the war. The pro-Brazilian Uruguayan government showed its support by sending troops. In 1865 the three countries signed the Treaty of the Triple Alliance against Paraguay. At the beginning of the war, the Paraguayans took the lead with several victories, until the Triple Alliance organized to repel the invaders and fight effectively. This was the second total war experience in the world after the American Civil War. It was deemed the greatest war effort in the history of all participating countries, taking almost 6 years and ending with the complete devastation of Paraguay. The country lost 40% of its territory to Brazil and Argentina and lost 60% of its population, including 90% of the men. The dictator Lopez was killed in battle and a new government was instituted in alliance with Brazil, which maintained occupation forces in the country until 1876.[57]\n\n\nThe last South American war in the 19th century was the War of the Pacific with Bolivia and Peru on one side and Chile on the other. In 1879 the war began with Chilean troops occupying Bolivian ports, followed by Bolivia declaring war on Chile which activated an alliance treaty with Peru. The Bolivians were completely defeated in 1880 and Lima was occupied in 1881. Peace was signed with Peru in 1883 while a truce was signed with Bolivia in 1884. Chile annexed territories of both countries leaving Bolivia landlocked.[58]\n\n\nIn the new century, as wars became less violent and less frequent, Brazil entered into a small conflict with Bolivia for the possession of the Acre, which was acquired by Brazil in 1902. In 1917 Brazil declared war on the Central Powers, joined the allied side in the First World War and sent a small fleet to the Mediterranean Sea and some troops to be integrated with the British and French forces in the region. Brazil was the only South American country that participated in the First World War.[59][60] Later in 1932 Colombia and Peru entered a short armed conflict for territory in the Amazon. In the same year Paraguay declared war on Bolivia for possession of the Chaco, in a conflict that ended three years later with Paraguay's victory. Between 1941 and 1942 Peru and Ecuador fought for territories claimed by both that were annexed by Peru, usurping Ecuador's frontier with Brazil.[61]\n\n\nAlso in this period, the first major naval battle of World War II took place in the South Atlantic close to the continental mainland: the Battle of the River Plate, between a British cruiser squadron and a German pocket battleship.[62] The Germans still made numerous attacks on Brazilian ships on the coast, causing Brazil to declare war on the Axis powers in 1942, being the only South American country to fight in this war (and in both World Wars). Brazil sent naval and air forces to combat German and Italian submarines off the continent and throughout the South Atlantic, in addition to sending an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian Campaign.[63][64]\n\n\nA brief war was fought between Argentina and the UK in 1982, following an Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, which ended with an Argentine defeat. The last international war to be fought on South American soil was the 1995 Cenepa War between Ecuador and the Peru along their mutual border.\n\n\n\n* ![Imperial Brazilian Navy siege of Paysandú, 1865](image)\n\nImperial Brazilian Navy siege of Paysandú, 1865\n* ![The Uruguayan Army at the Battle of Sauce, 1866](image)\n\nThe Uruguayan Army at the Battle of Sauce, 1866\n* ![The Imperial Brazilian Army during a procession in Paraguay, 1868](image)\n\nThe Imperial Brazilian Army during a procession in Paraguay, 1868\n* ![The Chilean Army in the battlefield of the Battle of Chorrillos, 1883](image)\n\nThe Chilean Army in the battlefield of the Battle of Chorrillos, 1883\n* ![A German submarine under attack by Brazilian Air Force PBY Catalina, 31 July 1943`](image)\n\nA German submarine under attack by Brazilian Air Force PBY Catalina, 31 July 1943`\n\n\n### Rise and fall of military dictatorships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Argentine soldiers during the Falklands War\nWars became less frequent in the 20th century, with Bolivia-Paraguay and Peru-Ecuador fighting the last inter-state wars. Early in the 20th century, the three wealthiest South American countries engaged in a vastly expensive naval arms race which began after the introduction of a new warship type, the \"dreadnought\". At one point, the Argentine government was spending a fifth of its entire yearly budget for just two dreadnoughts, a price that did not include later in-service costs, which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial purchase.[65][66]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Brazilian *Minas Geraes* class kindled an Argentine–Brazilian–Chilean naval arms race.\nThe continent became a battlefield of the Cold War in the late 20th century. Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of whom were tortured or killed on inter-state collaboration. Economically, they began a transition to neoliberal economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of \"National Security\" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an internal conflict.\n\n\nIn 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, a British dependent territory. The Falklands War began and 74 days later Argentine forces surrendered.[67]\n\n\nColombia has had an ongoing, though diminished internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation of Marxist guerrillas (FARC-EP) and then involved several illegal armed groups of leftist-leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords. Many of these are now defunct, and only a small portion of the ELN remains, along with the stronger, though also greatly reduced, FARC.\n\n\nRevolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships became common after World War II, but since the 1980s, a wave of democratization passed through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.[68] Nonetheless, allegations of corruption are still very common, and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments, although, on most occasions, regular civilian succession has continued.\n\n\n\n![](image)Presidents of UNASUR member states at the Second Brasília Summit on 23 May 2008\nInternational indebtedness turned into a severe problem in the late 1980s, and some countries, despite having strong democracies, have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without resorting to unorthodox economic policies, as most recently illustrated by Argentina's default in the early 21st century.[69][*neutrality is disputed*] The last twenty years have seen an increased push towards regional integration, with the creation of uniquely South American institutions such as the Andean Community, Mercosur and Unasur. Notably, starting with the election of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela in 1998, the region experienced what has been termed a pink tide[*citation needed*] – the election of several leftist and center-left administrations to most countries of the area, except for the Guianas and Colombia.\n\n\n\n### Contemporary issues[edit]\n\n\nSouth America's political geography since the 1990s has been characterized by a desire to reduce foreign influence.[70] The nationalization of industries, by which the state controls entire economic sectors (as opposed of private companies doing it), has become a prominent political issues in the region.[70] Some South American nations have nationalized their electricity industries.[70]\n\n\n\n## Countries and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of sovereign states and dependent territories in South America\n\n\n\n| Flag | Country / Territory | Area[l] | Population(2021)[1][2] | Populationdensity | Capital | Name(s) in official language(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Argentina | 2,766,890 km2(1,068,300 sq mi)\n | 45,276,780\n | 14.3/km2(37/sq mi)\n | Buenos Aires | Argentina\n |\n| ![](image) | Bolivia | 1,098,580 km2(424,160 sq mi)\n | 12,079,472\n | 8.4/km2(22/sq mi)\n | La Paz,Sucre[m] | Bolivia/Mborivia/Wuliwya/Puliwya\n |\n| ![](image) | Brazil | 8,514,877 km2(3,287,612 sq mi)\n | 214,326,223\n | 22/km2(57/sq mi)\n | Brasília | Brasil\n |\n| ![](image) | Chile[n] | 756,950 km2(292,260 sq mi)\n | 19,493,184\n | 22/km2(57/sq mi)\n | Santiago[o] | Chile\n |\n| ![](image) | Colombia | 1,141,748 km2(440,831 sq mi)\n | 51,516,562\n | 40/km2(100/sq mi)\n | Bogotá | Colombia\n |\n| ![](image) | Ecuador | 283,560 km2(109,480 sq mi)\n | 17,797,737\n | 53.8/km2(139/sq mi)\n | Quito | Ecuador/Ikwayur/Ekuatur\n |\n| ![](image) | Falkland Islands(United Kingdom)\n | 12,173 km2(4,700 sq mi)\n | 3,764\n | 0.26/km2(0.67/sq mi)\n | Stanley | Falkland Islands\n |\n| ![](image) | French Guiana(France)\n | 91,000 km2(35,000 sq mi)\n | 297,449\n | 2.1/km2(5.4/sq mi)\n | Cayenne(Préfecture)\n | Guyane\n |\n| ![](image) | Guyana | 214,999 km2(83,012 sq mi)\n | 804,567\n | 3.5/km2(9.1/sq mi)\n | Georgetown | Guyana\n |\n| ![](image) | Paraguay | 406,750 km2(157,050 sq mi)\n | 6,703,799\n | 15.6/km2(40/sq mi)\n | Asunción | Paraguay/Paraguái\n |\n| ![](image) | Peru | 1,285,220 km2(496,230 sq mi)\n | 33,715,471\n | 22/km2(57/sq mi)\n | Lima | Perú/Piruw/Piruw\n |\n| ![](image) | South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands(United Kingdom)[p] | 3,093 km2(1,194 sq mi)\n | 20\n | 0/km2(0/sq mi)\n | King Edward Point | South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\n |\n| ![](image) | Suriname | 163,270 km2(63,040 sq mi)\n | 612,985\n | 3/km2(7.8/sq mi)\n | Paramaribo | Suriname\n |\n| ![](image) | Uruguay | 176,220 km2(68,040 sq mi)\n | 3,426,260\n | 19.4/km2(50/sq mi)\n | Montevideo | Uruguay/Uruguai\n |\n| ![](image) | Venezuela | 916,445 km2(353,841 sq mi)\n | 28,199,867\n | 27.8/km2(72/sq mi)\n | Caracas | Venezuela\n |\n| Total\n | 17,824,513 km2(6,882,083 sq mi)\n | 434,254,119\n | 21.5/km2(56/sq mi)\n |  |\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the UNASUR in Quito, Ecuador\n![](image)Scheme for geographic regions and subregions used by the United Nations Statistics Division\n![](image)South American flags\nHistorically, the Hispanic countries were founded as Republican dictatorships led by caudillos. Brazil was the only exception, being a constitutional monarchy for its first 67 years of independence, until a coup d'état proclaimed a republic. In the late 19th century, the most democratic countries were Brazil,[71] Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.[72]\n\n\nAll South American countries are presidential republics with the exception of Suriname, a parliamentary republic. French Guiana is a French overseas department, while the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are British overseas territories. It is currently the only inhabited continent in the world without monarchies; the Empire of Brazil existed during the 19th century and there was an unsuccessful attempt to establish a Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia in southern Argentina and Chile. Also in the twentieth century, Suriname was established as a constituent kingdom of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Guyana retained the British monarch as head of state for 4 years after its independence.\n\n\nRecently, an intergovernmental entity has been formed which aims to merge the two existing customs unions: Mercosur and the Andean Community, thus forming the third-largest trade bloc in the world.[73]\nThis new political organization, known as Union of South American Nations, seeks to establish free movement of people, economic development, a common defense policy and the elimination of tariffs.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of South America\n\nSee also: List of South American countries by population and List of South American countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Satellite view of South America at night from NASA, showing the contrast between heavily populated coastal areas and the more remote regions of the Amazonian interior and Patagonia\nSouth America has a population of over 428 million people. They are distributed as to form a \"hollow continent\" with most of the population concentrated around the margins of the continent.[70] On one hand, there are several sparsely populated areas such as tropical forests, the Atacama Desert and the icy portions of Patagonia. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly Spaniards, Portuguese and Italians), Africans and Amerindians. There is a high percentage of Mestizos that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of Asians,[*further explanation needed*] especially in Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. The two main languages are by far Spanish and Portuguese, followed by English, French and Dutch in smaller numbers.\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of South America\n\n![](image)Official languages in South America\nSpanish and Portuguese are the most spoken languages in South America, with approximately 200 million speakers each. Spanish is the official language of most countries, along with other native languages in some countries. Portuguese is the official language of Brazil. Dutch is the official language of Suriname; English is the official language of Guyana, although there are at least twelve other languages spoken in the country, including Portuguese, Chinese, Hindustani and several native languages.[74] English is also spoken in the Falkland Islands. French is the official language of French Guiana and the second language in Amapá, Brazil.\n\n\nIndigenous languages of South America include Quechua in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Colombia; Wayuunaiki in northern Colombia (La Guajira) and northwestern Venezuela (Zulia); Guaraní in Paraguay and, to a much lesser extent, in Bolivia; Aymara in Bolivia, Peru, and less often in Chile; and Mapudungun is spoken in certain pockets of southern Chile. At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.\n\n\nOther languages found in South America include Hindustani and Javanese in Suriname; Italian in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela; and German in certain pockets of Argentina and Brazil. German is also spoken in many regions of the southern states of Brazil, Riograndenser Hunsrückisch being the most widely spoken German dialect in the country; among other Germanic dialects, a Brazilian form of East Pomeranian is also well represented and is experiencing a revival. Welsh remains spoken and written in the historic towns of Trelew and Rawson in the Argentine Patagonia. Arabic speakers, often of Lebanese, Syrian, or Palestinian descent, can be found in Arab communities in Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela and in Paraguay.[75]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Las Lajas Sanctuary, Ipiales, Colombia\nMain articles: Religion in South America and Religion in Latin America\n\nSee also: History of the Jews in Latin America and the Caribbean, Buddhism in Brazil, and Islam in Argentina\n\nAn estimated 90% of South Americans are Christians[76] (82% Roman Catholic, 8% other Christian denominations mainly traditional Protestants and Evangelicals but also Orthodox), accounting for 19% of Christians worldwide.\n\n\nAfrican descendent religions and Indigenous religions are also common throughout all South America; some examples of are Santo Daime, Candomblé, and Umbanda.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nCrypto-Jews or Marranos, conversos, and Anusim were an important part of colonial life in Latin America.\n\n\nBoth Buenos Aires, Argentina and São Paulo, Brazil figure among the largest Jewish populations by urban area.\n\n\nEast Asian religions such as Japanese Buddhism, Shintoism, and Shinto-derived Japanese New Religions are common in Brazil and Peru. Korean Confucianism is especially found in Brazil while Chinese Buddhism and Chinese Confucianism have spread throughout the continent.\n\n\nKardecist Spiritism can be found in several countries.\n\n\nHindus form 25% of the Guyanese population and 22% of Suriname's.[77][78]\n\n\nMuslims account for 6.8% of the Guyanese population and 13.9 of the Surinamese population.[77][78] Almost all Muslims in Suriname are either Indonesian or Indians and in Guyana, most are Indian.\n\n\n**Part of Religions in South America (2013):[79]**\n\n\n\n\n\nReligion in South America\n| Countries\n | Christians\n | *Roman Catholics* | *Other Christians* | No religion (atheists and agnostics)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Argentina | 88% | 77% | 11% | 11%\n |\n| Bolivia | 96% | 74% | 22% | 4%\n |\n| Brazil | 88% | 64% | 22% | 8%\n |\n| Chile | 70% | 57% | 13% | 25%\n |\n| Colombia | 92% | 80% | 12% | 7%\n |\n| Paraguay | 96% | 87% | 9% | 2%\n |\n| Peru | 94% | 81% | 13% | 3%\n |\n| Suriname | 51% | 29% | 22% | 5%\n |\n| Uruguay | 58% | 47% | 11% | 41%\n |\n| Venezuela | 88% | 71% | 17% | 8%\n |\n\n\n### Ethnic demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in South America\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **possibly contains original research**.

In Argentina, the European influence accounts for 65–79% of the genetic background, Amerindian for 17–31% and sub-Saharan African for 2–4%. In Colombia, the sub-Saharan African genetic background varied from 1% to 89%, while the European genetic background varied from 20% to 79%, depending on the region.\nIn Peru, European ancestries ranged from 1% to 31%, while the African contribution was only 1% to 3%.[80] The Genographic Project determined the average Peruvian from Lima had about 25% European ancestry, 68% Native American, 3% Southwest Asian ancestry and 2% sub-Saharan African.[81]\n\n\nDescendants of indigenous peoples, such as the Quechua and Aymara, or the Urarina[82] of Amazonia make up the majority of the population in Bolivia (56%) and Peru (44%).[83][84] In Ecuador, Amerindians are a large minority that comprises two-fifths of the population. The native European population is also a significant element in most other former Portuguese colonies.\n\n\nPeople who identify as of primarily or totally European descent, or identify their phenotype as corresponding to such group, are a majority in Argentina,[85] Uruguay[86] and Chile (64.7%),[87] and are 48.4% of the population in Brazil.[88][89][90] In Venezuela, according to the national census, 42% of the population is primarily native Spanish, Italian and Portuguese descendants.[91] In Colombia, people who identify as European descendants are about 37%.[92][93] In Peru, European descendants are the third group in number (15%).[94]\n\n\nMestizos (mixed European and Amerindian) are the largest ethnic group in Bolivia, Paraguay, Venezuela, Colombia[92] and Ecuador and the second group in Peru and Chile.\n\n\nSouth America is also home to one of the largest populations of Africans. This group is significantly present in Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Venezuela and Ecuador.\n\n\nBrazil followed by Peru have the largest Japanese, Korean and Chinese communities in South America, Lima has the largest ethnic Chinese community in Latin America.[95] Guyana and Suriname have the largest ethnic East Indian community.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnic distribution in South America[96][97][98]\n| Country\n | Amerindians | White people | Mestizos / Pardos | Mulatos | Black people | Zambos | Asian people |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Argentina\n | 1% | **85**% | 14% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0%\n |\n| Bolivia\n | **48**% | 12% | 37% | 2% | 0% | <1% | 0%\n |\n| Brazil\n | <1% | **48**% | 43% | 0% | 8% | 0% | 2%\n |\n| Chile\n | 6% | **69**% | 25% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0%\n |\n| Colombia\n | 2% | 37% | **50**% | 8% | 2% | 0% | <1%\n |\n| Ecuador\n | 39% | 10% | **41**% | 5% | 5% | 0% | 0%\n |\n| Paraguay\n | 3% | 20% | **75**% | 4% | 0% | 0% | 0%\n |\n| Peru\n | **45**% | 15% | 35% | 2% | 0% | 0% | 3%\n |\n| Suriname\n | 3.8% | 1% | 13.4%\\* noted in Suriname as mixed, regardless of race combination | \\*see Pardo | 37.4% | \\*see Pardo | **48.3**%\n |\n| Uruguay\n | 0% | **88**% | 8% | 4% | 0% | 0% | 0%\n |\n| Venezuela\n | 2.7% | 43.6% | **51.6%** | 0.7% | 2.8% | 0.6% | 0.6%\n |\n| Guyana\n | 10.5%\n | 0.36%\n | 19.9%\\* noted in Guyana as mixed regardless of race combination\n | \\*see Pardo\n | 29.2%\n | \\*see Pardo\n | **39.98%** |\n\n\n#### Indigenous people[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Indigenous peoples of South America and Indigenous peoples in South America\n\nIn many places indigenous people still practice a traditional lifestyle based on subsistence agriculture or as hunter-gatherers.

The second largest country is Colombia with a population of 51,516,562. Argentina is the third most populous country with 45,276,780.\n\n\nWhile Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. The largest cities in South America, by far, are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima, and Bogotá. These cities are the only cities on the continent whose metropolitan areas' population exceed eight million. Next in size are Caracas, Belo Horizonte, and Medellin.\n\n\nFive of the top ten metropolitan areas are in Brazil. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the São Paulo metropolitan area, Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, and Belo Horizonte metropolitan area. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the Buenos Aires metropolitan region is above 13 million inhabitants.\n\n\nSouth America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and Greater Porto Alegre. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.\n\n\nThe top ten largest South American metropolitan areas by population as of 2015, based on national census numbers from each country:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Metro Area\n | Population\n | Area\n | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| São Paulo | 21,090,792\n | 7,947 km2 (3,068 sq mi)\n | Brazil\n |\n| Buenos Aires | 13,693,657\n | 3,830 km2 (1,480 sq mi)\n | Argentina\n |\n| Rio de Janeiro | 13,131,431\n | 6,744 km2 (2,604 sq mi)\n | Brazil\n |\n| Lima | 9,904,727\n | 2,819 km2 (1,088 sq mi)\n | Peru\n |\n| Bogotá | 9,800,225\n | 4,200 km2 (1,600 sq mi)\n | Colombia\n |\n| Santiago | 6,683,852\n | 15,403 km2 (5,947 sq mi)\n | Chile\n |\n| Belo Horizonte | 5,829,923\n | 9,467 km2 (3,655 sq mi)\n | Brazil\n |\n| Caracas | 5,322,310\n | 4,715 km2 (1,820 sq mi)\n | Venezuela\n |\n| Porto Alegre | 4,258,926\n | 10,232 km2 (3,951 sq mi)\n | Brazil\n |\n| Brasilia | 4,201,737\n | 56,433 km2 (21,789 sq mi)\n | Brazil\n |\n\n\n2015 Census figures.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of South America, List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal), and List of South American countries by GDP (PPP)\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Most agricultural and livestock products are destined for the domestic market and local consumption. However, the export of agricultural products is essential for the balance of trade in most countries.[101]\n\n\nThe main agrarian crops are export crops, such as soy and wheat. The production of staple foods such as vegetables, corn or beans is large, but focused on domestic consumption. Livestock raising for meat exports is important in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. In tropical regions the most important crops are coffee, cocoa and bananas, mainly in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. Traditionally, the countries producing sugar for export are Peru, Guyana and Suriname, and in Brazil, sugar cane is also used to make ethanol. On the coast of Peru, northeast and south of Brazil, cotton is grown. 50.5% of the South America's land surface is covered by forest,[102] but timber industries are small and directed to domestic markets. In recent years, however, transnational companies have been settling in the Amazon to exploit noble timber destined for export. The Pacific coastal waters of South America are the most important for commercial fishing. The anchovy catch reaches thousands of tonnes, and tuna is also abundant (Peru is a major exporter). The capture of crustaceans is remarkable, particularly in northeastern Brazil and Chile.[101]\n\n\nOnly Brazil and Argentina are part of the G20 (industrial countries), while only Brazil is part of the G8+5 (the most powerful and influential nations in the world). In the tourism sector, a series of negotiations began in 2005 to promote tourism and increase air connections within the region. Punta del Este, Florianópolis and Mar del Plata are among the most important resorts in South America.[101]\n\n\nThe most industrialized countries in South America are Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay respectively. These countries alone account for more than 75 percent of the region's economy and add up to a GDP of more than US$3.0 trillion. Industries in South America began to take on the economies of the region from the 1930s when the Great Depression in the United States and other countries of the world boosted industrial production in the continent. From that period the region left the agricultural side behind and began to achieve high rates of economic growth that remained until the early 1990s when they slowed due to political instabilities, economic crises and neoliberal policies.[101]\n\n\nSince the end of the economic crisis in Brazil and Argentina that occurred in the period from 1998 to 2002, which has led to economic recession, rising unemployment and falling population income, the industrial and service sectors have been recovering rapidly. Chile, Argentina and Brazil have recovered fastest, growing at an average of 5% per year. All of South America after this period has been recovering and showing good signs of economic stability, with controlled inflation and exchange rates, continuous growth, a decrease in social inequality and unemployment – factors that favor industry.[101]\n\n\nThe main industries are: electronics, textiles, food, automotive, metallurgy, aviation, naval, clothing, beverage, steel, tobacco, timber, chemical, among others. Exports reach almost US$400 billion annually, with Brazil accounting for half of this.[101]\n\n\nThe economic gap between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than on most other continents. The richest 10% receive over 40% of the nation's income in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay,[103] while the poorest 20% receive 4% or less in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia.[104] This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie in the vicinity of skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments; nearly one in nine South Americans live on less than $2 per day (on a purchasing power parity basis).[105]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country | GDP (nominal)  in 2017 (in millions of dollars)[106] | GDP (PPP)  in 2017 (in millions of dollars)[106] | GDP (PPP)  per capita  in 2017[106] | Merchandise  exports($bn), 2011[100] | HDI  in 2017  (rank)[107] | Percent with  less than  $2 (PPP)per person  per day[*citation needed*] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Argentina\n | 628,935 | 912,816 | 20,707 | 83.7 | 0.825 | 2.6 |\n| Bolivia\n | 39,267 | 83,608 | 7,552 | 9.1 | 0.693 | 24.9 |\n| Brazil\n | 2,140,940 | 3,216,031 | 15,485 | 250.8 | 0.759 | 10.8 |\n| Chile\n | 251,220 | 455,941 | 24,796 | 86.1 | 0.845 | 2.7 |\n| Colombia\n | 306,439 | 720,151 | 14,609 | 56.5 | 0.747 | 15.8 |\n| Ecuador\n | 97,362 | 184,629 | 11,004 | 22.3 | 0.752 | 10.6 |\n| Falkland Islands[108] (UK)\n | 206.4 | 206.4 | 70,800 | 0.26 |  |  |\n| French Guiana[109] (France)\n | 4,456 | 4,456 | 19,728 | 1.3 |  |  |\n| Guyana\n | 3,591 | 6,398 | 8,306 | 0.9 | 0.654 | 18.0 |\n| Paraguay\n | 28,743 | 68,005 | 9,779 | 9.8 | 0.702 | 13.2 |\n| Peru\n | 207,072 | 429,711 | 13,501 | 46.3 | 0.750 | 12.7 |\n| Suriname\n | 3,641 | 7,961 | 13,934 | 1.6 | 0.720 | 27.2 |\n| Uruguay\n | 58,123 | 77,800 | 22,271 | 8.0 | 0.804 | 2.2 |\n| Venezuela\n | 251,589 | 404,109 | 12,856 | 92.6 | 0.761 | 12.9 |\n| Total | 3,836,569 | 6,642,623 | 17,852 | 669.1 | 0.772 | 11.3 |\n\n\n### Economically largest cities as of 2014[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | City\n | Country\n | GDP in Int$ bn[110] | Population (mil)[110] | GDP per capita\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | São Paulo | Brazil\n | $430\n | 20,847,500\n | $20,650\n |\n| 2\n | Buenos Aires | Argentina\n | $315\n | 13,381,800\n | $23,606\n |\n| 3\n | Lima | Peru\n | $176\n | 10,674,100\n | $16,530\n |\n| 4\n | Rio de Janeiro | Brazil\n | $176\n | 12,460,200\n | $14,176\n |\n| 5\n | Santiago | Chile\n | $171\n | 7,164,400\n | $32,929\n |\n| 6\n | Bogotá | Colombia\n | $160\n | 9,135,800\n | $17,497\n |\n| 7\n | Brasília | Brazil\n | $141\n | 3,976,500\n | $35,689\n |\n| 8\n | Belo Horizonte | Brazil\n | $84\n | 5,595,800\n | $15,134\n |\n| 9\n | Porto Alegre | Brazil\n | $62\n | 4,120,900\n | $15,078\n |\n| 10\n | Campinas | Brazil\n | $59\n | 2,854,200\n | $20,759\n |\n\n\nThe four countries with the strongest agriculture are Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia.

The country was the second largest producer of beef in 2019, responsible for 15.4% of global production.[114] It was also the thirdrd largest world producer of milk in 2018. This year, the country produced 35.1 billion liters.[115] In 2019, Brazil was the 4th largest pork producer in the world, with almost 4 million tonnes.[116]\n\n\nIn 2018, Argentina was the fourth largest producer of beef in the world, with a production of 3 million tonnes (behind only the United States, Brazil and China). Uruguay is also a major meat producer.

According to the 2019 list, Brazil has the thirteenth most valuable industry in the world (US$173.6 billion), Venezuela the thirtieth largest (US$58.2 billion, however, it depends on oil to obtain this value), Argentina the 31st largest (US$57.7 billion), Colombia the 46th largest (US$35.4 billion), Peru the 50th largest (US$28.7 billion) and Chile the 51st largest (US$28.3 billion).[119]\n\n\nBrazil has the third-largest manufacturing sector in the Americas. Accounting for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil's industries range from automobiles, steel, and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft (Embraer), food, pharmaceutical, footwear, metallurgy and consumer durables. In the food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world.[120][121][122] In 2016, the country was the 2nd largest producer of pulp in the world and the 8th producer of paper.[123][124][125] In the footwear industry, in 2019, Brazil ranked 4th among world producers.[126][127][128][129] In 2019, the country was the 8th producer of vehicles and the 9th producer of steel in the world.[130][131][132] In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the 8th in the world.[133][134][135] In textile industry, Brazil, although it was among the five largest world producers in 2013, is very little integrated in world trade.[136]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cerro Rico, Potosi, Bolivia, still a major silver mine\n![](image)Amethyst mine in Ametista do Sul.

Brazil is the world's second largest iron ore exporter.\nMining is one of the most important economic sectors in South America, especially for Chile, Peru and Bolivia, whose economies are highly dependent on this sector. The continent has large productions of gold (mainly in Peru, Brazil and Argentina);[137] silver (mainly in Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina);[138] copper (mainly in Chile, Peru and Brazil);[139] iron ore (Brazil, Peru and Chile);[140] zinc (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil);[141] molybdenum (Chile and Peru);[142] lithium (Chile, Argentina and Brazil);[143] lead (Peru and Bolivia);[144] bauxite (Brazil);[145] tin (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil);[146] manganese (Brazil);[147] antimony (Bolivia and Ecuador);[148] nickel (Brazil);[149] niobium (Brazil);[150] rhenium (Chile);[151] iodine (Chile),[152] among others.\n\n\nBrazil stands out in the extraction of iron ore (where it is the second largest producer and exporter in the world – iron ore is usually one of the three export products that generate the greatest value in the country's trade balance), copper, gold, bauxite (one of the five largest producers in the world), manganese (one of the five largest producers in the world), tin (one of the largest producers in the world), niobium (concentrates 98% of reserves known to the world) and nickel. In terms of gemstones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and opal.[153][154][155][156][157][158]\n\n\nChile contributes about a third of the world copper production.[159] In addition to copper, Chile was, in 2019, the world's largest producer of iodine[160] and rhenium,[161] the second largest producer of lithium[162] and molybdenum,[142] the sixth largest producer of silver,[163] the seventh largest producer of salt,[164] the eighth largest producer of potash,[165] the thirteenth producer of sulfur[166] and the thirteenth producer of iron ore[167] in the world.\n\n\nIn 2019, Peru was the 2nd largest world producer of copper[168] and silver,[163] 8th largest world producer of gold,[169] 3rd largest world producer of lead,[144] 2nd largest world producer of zinc,[170] 4th largest world producer of tin,[171] 5th largest world producer of boron[172] and 4th largest world producer of molybdenum.[142]\n\n\nIn 2019, Bolivia was the 8th largest world producer of silver;[163] 4th largest world producer of boron;[172] 5th largest world producer of antimony;[173] 5th largest world producer of tin;[171] 6th largest world producer of tungsten;[174] 7th largest producer of zinc,[175] and the 8th largest producer of lead.[144][176][177]\n\n\nIn 2019, Argentina was the 4th largest world producer of lithium,[162] the 9th largest world producer of silver,[163] the 17th largest world producer of gold[169] and the 7th largest world producer of boron.[172]\n\n\nColombia is the world's largest producer of emeralds.[178] In the production of gold, among 2006 and 2017, the country produced 15 tons per year until 2007, when its production increased significantly, breaking a record of 66.1 tons extracted in 2012. In 2017, it extracted 52.2 tons. The country is among the 25 largest gold producers in the world.[179] In the production of silver, in 2017 the country extracted 15,5 tons.[176][177][180]\n\n\nIn the production of oil, Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Venezuela was the 21st largest, with 877 thousand barrels / day, Colombia in 22nd with 886 thousand barrels / day, Ecuador in 28th with 531 thousand barrels / day and Argentina 29th with 507 thousand barrels / day. As Venezuela and Ecuador consume little oil and export most of their production, they are part of OPEC. Venezuela had a big drop in production after 2015 (where it produced 2.5 million barrels / day), falling in 2016 to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, due to lack of investments.[181]\n\n\nIn the production of natural gas, in 2018, Argentina produced 1524 bcf (billion cubic feet), Venezuela 946, Brazil 877, Bolivia 617, Peru 451, Colombia 379.[182]\n\n\nIn the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, Brazil exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January 2021, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.[183]\n\n\nIn the production of coal, the continent had 2 of the 30 largest world producers in 2018: Colombia (12th) and Brazil (27th).[184]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Grape plantation in Argentina.

Some of the most visited places in the region are Rio de Janeiro, Florianópolis, Iguazu Falls, São Paulo, Armação dos Búzios, Salvador, Bombinhas, Angra dos Reis, Balneário Camboriú, Paraty, Ipojuca, Natal, Cairu, Fortaleza and Itapema in Brazil;[187] Buenos Aires, Bariloche, Salta, Jujuy, Perito Moreno Glacier, Valdes Peninsula, Guarani Jesuit Missions in the cities of Misiones and Corrientes, Ischigualasto Provincial Park, Ushuaia and Patagonia in Argentina;[188]\nIsla Margarita, Angel Falls, Los Roques archipelago, Gran Sabana in Venezuela; Machu Picchu, Lima, Nazca Lines, Cuzco in Peru; Lake Titicaca, Salar de Uyuni, La Paz, Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos in Bolivia; Tayrona National Natural Park, Santa Marta, Bogotá, Cali, Medellín, Cartagena in Colombia, and the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.[189][190] In 2016 Brazil hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Cartagena (2008), a major port on the northern coast of Colombia and one of the country's main tourist destinations\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTeatro Solis, Uruguay\n![](image)\nNational Library, Brazil\n![](image)\nArya Diwaker Hindu temple, Paramaribo, Suriname\n\nSouth Americans are culturally influenced by their indigenous peoples, the historic connection with the Iberian Peninsula and Africa, and waves of immigrants from around the globe.\n\n\nSouth American nations have a rich variety of music. Some of the most famous genres include vallenato and cumbia from Colombia, pasillo from Colombia and Ecuador, samba, bossa nova and música sertaneja from Brazil, joropo from Venezuela and tango from Argentina and Uruguay. Also well known is the non-commercial folk genre Nueva Canción movement which was founded in Argentina and Chile and quickly spread to the rest of the Latin America.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nTango show in Buenos Aires, typical Argentine dance\n![](image)\nCarmen Miranda, Portuguese Brazilian singer helped popularize samba internationally.\n\nPeople on the Peruvian coast created the fine guitar and cajon duos or trios in the most mestizo (mixed) of South American rhythms such as the Marinera (from Lima), the Tondero (from Piura), the 19th-century popular Creole Valse or Peruvian Valse, the soulful Arequipan Yaravi, and the early-20th-century Paraguayan Guarania. In the late 20th century, Spanish rock emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. Brazil has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres. In the central and western regions of Bolivia, Andean and folklore music like Diablada, Caporales and Morenada are the most representative of the country, which were originated by European, Aymara and Quechua influences.\n\n\nThe literature of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel García Márquez in novels and Jorge Luis Borges and Pablo Neruda in other genres. The Brazilians Machado de Assis and João Guimarães Rosa are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writers.\n\n\n\n### Food and drink[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of South America\n\nBecause of South America's broad ethnic mix, South American cuisine has African, Mestizo, South Asian, East Asian, and European influences. Bahia, Brazil, is especially well known for its West African–influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. People in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Chile, Bolivia and Southern Brazil drink mate, an herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, terere, differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. Pisco is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, African, Arab, Andean, and Amazonic food.\n\n\n\n### Plastic arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Art of South America\n\n![](image)*Bird* (UOB Plaza, Singapore), sculpture of Colombian artist Fernando Botero\n![](image)\"Chromovegetal Maze\" by Carlos Cruz Diez, in Caracas\nThe artist Oswaldo Guayasamín (1919–1999) from Ecuador, represented with his painting style the feeling of the peoples of Latin America[191] highlighting social injustices in various parts of the world. The Colombian Fernando Botero (1932–2023) was one of the greatest exponents of painting and sculpture was able to develop a recognizable style of his own.[192] For his part, the Venezuelan Carlos Cruz-Diez has contributed significantly to contemporary art,[193] with the presence of works around the world.\n\n\nCurrently several emerging South American artists are recognized by international art critics: Guillermo Lorca – Chilean painter,[194][195] Teddy Cobeña – Ecuadorian sculptor and recipient of international sculpture award in France)[196][197][198] and Argentine artist Adrián Villar Rojas[199][200] – winner of the Zurich Museum Art Award among many others.\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in South America\n\n![](image)Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, BrazilA wide range of sports are played in the continent of South America, with football being the most popular overall, while baseball is the most popular in Venezuela.\n\n\nOther sports include basketball, cycling, polo, volleyball, futsal, motorsports, rugby (mostly in Argentina and Uruguay), handball, tennis, golf, field hockey, boxing, and cricket.\n\n\nSouth America hosted its first Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016, and has hosted the Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2018.\n\n\nSouth America shares with Europe supremacy over the sport of football as all winners in FIFA World Cup history and all winning teams in the FIFA Club World Cup have come from these two continents. Brazil holds the record for most times winning the FIFA World Cup with five titles.[201] Argentina has three titles and Uruguay two. So far five South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). Two were from Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978).\n\n\nSouth America is home to the longest-running international football tournament, the Copa América, which has been contested since 1916. Argentina and Uruguay have won the Copa América 15 times each, the most among all countries.\n\n\nAlso, in South America, a multi-sport event, the South American Games, are held every four years. The first edition was held in La Paz in 1978 and the most recent took place in Santiago in 2014.\n\n\nSouth American Cricket Championship is an international one-day cricket tournament played since 1995 featuring national teams from South America and certain other invited sides including teams from North America, currently played annually but until 2013 was usually played every two seasons.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wind farm in the Paraguaná Peninsula, Venezuela\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nDue to the diversity of topography and pluviometric precipitation conditions, the region's water resources vary enormously in different areas. In the Andes, navigation possibilities are limited, except for the Magdalena River, Lake Titicaca and the lakes of the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. Irrigation is an important factor for agriculture from northwestern Peru to Patagonia. Less than 10% of the known electrical potential of the Andes had been used until the mid-1960s.\n\n\nThe Brazilian Highlands have a much higher hydroelectric potential than the Andean region[*citation needed*] and its possibilities of exploitation are greater due to the existence of several large rivers with high margins and the occurrence of great differences forming huge cataracts, such as those of Paulo Afonso, Iguaçu and others. The Amazon River system has about 13,000 km of waterways, but its possibilities for hydroelectric use are still unknown.\n\n\nMost of the continent's energy is generated through hydroelectric power plants, but there is also an important share of thermoelectric and wind energy. Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries that generate nuclear power, each with two nuclear power plants. In 1991 these countries signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Itaipu Dam, the second largest of the world in energy production\n\n![](image)Wind power in Parnaíba\n![](image)Angra Nuclear Power Plant in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro\n![](image)Pirapora Solar Complex, the largest in Brazil and Latin America with a capacity of 321 MW\nThe Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Production manages to supply the country's demand.[181] In the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, the country exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January this year, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.[183]\n\n\nBrazil is one of the main world producers of hydroelectric power. In 2019, Brazil had 217 hydroelectric plants in operation, with an installed capacity of 98,581 MW, 60.16% of the country's energy generation.[202] In the total generation of electricity, in 2019 Brazil reached 170,000 megawatts of installed capacity, more than 75% from renewable sources (the majority, hydroelectric).[203][204]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Southeast Region used about 50% of the load of the National Integrated System (SIN), being the main energy consuming region in the country. The region's installed electricity generation capacity totaled almost 42,500 MW, which represented about a third of Brazil's generation capacity. The hydroelectric generation represented 58% of the region's installed capacity, with the remaining 42% corresponding basically to the thermoelectric generation. São Paulo accounted for 40% of this capacity; Minas Gerais by about 25%; Rio de Janeiro by 13.3%; and Espírito Santo accounted for the rest. The South Region owns the Itaipu Dam, which was the largest hydroelectric plant in the world for several years, until the inauguration of Three Gorges Dam in China. It remains the second largest operating hydroelectric in the world. Brazil is the co-owner of the Itaipu Plant with Paraguay: the dam is located on the Paraná River, located on the border between countries. It has an installed generation capacity of 14 GW for 20 generating units of 700 MW each. North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and Tucuruí Dam, which produce much of the national energy. Brazil's hydroelectric potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory.[205][206]\n\n\nAs of July 2022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power was 22 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%.[207][208] While the world average wind production capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil, specially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity factors over 60%;[209][210] the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45% in the coast and 49% in the interior.[211] In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of the energy generated in the country.[212] In 2019, it was estimated that the country had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW (this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country's current demand.[213][214] In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21 GW),[215][216] and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, United States and Germany.[217][218]\n\n\nNuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity.[219] The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear S/A), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás. Nuclear energy is produced by two reactors at Angra. It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro. It consists of two pressurized water reactors, Angra I, with capacity of 657 MW, connected to the power grid in 1982, and Angra II, with capacity of 1,350 MW, connected in 2000. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of 1,350 MW, is planned to be finished.[220]\n\n\nAs of October 2022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of photovoltaic solar was 21 GW, with average capacity factor of 23%.[221] Some of the most irradiated Brazilian States are MG (\"Minas Gerais\"), BA (\"Bahia\") and GO (Goiás), which have indeed world irradiation level records.[222][210][223] In 2019, solar power represented 1.27% of the energy generated in the country.[212] In 2021, Brazil was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13 GW),[224] and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).[225]\n\n\nIn 2020, Brazil was the 2nd largest country in the world in the production of energy through biomass (energy production from solid biofuels and renewable waste), with 15,2 GW installed.[226]\n\n\nAfter Brazil, Colombia is the country in South America that most stands out in energy production. In 2020, the country was the 20th largest petroleum producer in the world, and in 2015 it was the 19th largest exporter. In natural gas, the country was, in 2015, the 40th largest producer in the world. Colombia's biggest highlight is in coal, where the country was, in 2018, the world's 12th largest producer and the 5th largest exporter. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 45th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (0.5 GW), 76th in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.1 GW) and 20th in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (12.6 GW). Venezuela, which was one of the world's largest oil producers (about 2.5 million barrels/day in 2015) and one of the largest exporters, due to its political problems, has had its production drastically reduced in recent years: in 2016, it dropped to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, reaching only 300,000 barrels/day at a given point. The country also stands out in hydroelectricity, where it was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed capacity in 2020 (16,5 GW). Argentina was, in 2017, the 18th largest producer in the world, and the largest producer in Latin America, of natural gas, in addition to being the 28th largest oil producer; although the country has the Vaca Muerta field, which holds close to 16 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil, and is the second largest shale natural gas deposit in the world, the country lacks the capacity to exploit the deposit: it is necessary capital, technology and knowledge that can only come from offshore energy companies, who view Argentina and its erratic economic policies with considerable suspicion, not wanting to invest in the country. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 27th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (2.6 GW), 42nd in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.7 GW) and 21st in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW). The country has great future potential for the production of wind energy in the Patagonia region. Chile, although currently not a major energy producer, has great future potential for solar energy production in the Atacama Desert region. Paraguay stands out today in hydroelectric production thanks to the Itaipu Power Plant. Bolivia stand out in the production of natural gas, where it was the 31st largest in the world in 2015. Ecuador, because it consumes little energy, is part of OPEC and was the 27th largest oil producer in the world in 2020, being the 22nd largest exporter in 2014.[227][228][229][218]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nTransport in South America is basically carried out using various modes including: roads, seaports and airports. The railway and fluvial sector, although having more robust contemporary potential, are still somewhat treated in a secondary way.\n\n\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\nDue to the Andes Mountains, Amazon River and Amazon Forest, there have always been difficulties in implementing largerscale transcontinental or bioceanic highways. Practically the only route that existed was the one that connected Brazil to Buenos Aires, (in Argentina) and later to Santiago, (in Chile). However, in recent years, with the combined effort of countries, new routes have started to emerge, such as Brazil-Peru (Interoceanic Highway), and a new highway between Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile (Bioceanic Corridor).\n\n\nSome of the most modern roads extend through northern and south-east Argentina; and south of Brazil, a vast road complex aims to link Brasília, the federal capital, to the South, Southeast, Northeast and Northern regions of Brazil.\n\n\nBrazil has more than 1.7 million km of roads, of which 215,000 km are paved, and about 14,000 km are divided highways. The two most important highways in the country are BR-101 and BR-116.[230] Argentina has more than 600,000 km of roads, of which about 70,000 km are paved, and about 2,500 km are divided highways. The three most important highways in the country are Route 9, Route 7 and Route 14.[230] Colombia has about 210,000 km of roads, and about 2,300 km are divided highways.[231] Chile has about 82,000 km of roads, 20,000 km of which are paved, and about 2,000 km are divided highways. The most important highway in the country is the Route 5 (Pan-American Highway)[232] These 4 countries are the ones with the best road infrastructure and with the largest number of double-lane highways.\n\n\nIn addition, there is a reputed Pan-American Highway, which crosses Argentina and the Andean countries from north to south, although various stretches are unfinished.[233]\n\n\n\n#### Aviation[edit]\n\n\nIn South America, commercial aviation has a magnificent expansion field, which has one of the largest traffic density lines in the world, Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo, and large airports, such as Congonhas, São Paulo–Guarulhos International and Viracopos (São Paulo), Rio de Janeiro International and Santos Dumont (Rio de Janeiro), El Dorado (Bogotá), Ezeiza (Buenos Aires), Tancredo Neves International Airport (Belo Horizonte), Curitiba International Airport (Curitiba), Brasilia, Caracas, Montevideo, Lima, Viru Viru International Airport (Santa Cruz de la Sierra), Recife, Salvador, Salgado Filho International Airport (Porto Alegre), Fortaleza, Manaus and Belém.\n\n\nThere are more than 2,000 airports in Brazil. The country has the second largest number of airports in the world, behind only the United States. São Paulo International Airport, located in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, is the largest and busiest in the country – the airport connects São Paulo to practically all major cities around the world. Brazil has 44 international airports, such as those in Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Florianópolis, Cuiabá, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza, Belém and Manaus, among others. Argentina has important international airports such as Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Bariloche, Mendoza, Salta, Puerto Iguazú, Neuquén and Usuhaia, among others. Chile has important international airports such as Santiago, Antofagasta, Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas and Iquique, among others. Colombia has important international airports such as Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena, Cali and Barranquilla, among others. Other important airports are those in the capitals of Uruguay (Montevideo), Paraguay (Asunción), Peru (Lima), Bolivia (La Paz) and Ecuador (Quito). The 10 busiest airports in South America in 2017 were: São Paulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia), São Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil), Santiago (Chile), Lima (Peru), Brasília (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires-Aeroparque (Argentina), Buenos Aires-Ezeiza (Argentina), and Minas Gerais (Brazil).[234]\n\n\n\n#### Seaports and harbors[edit]\n\n\nThe two main merchant fleets also belong to Brazil and Argentina. The following are those of Chile, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia. The largest ports in commercial movement are those of Buenos Aires, Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Bahía Blanca, Rosario, Valparaíso, Recife, Salvador, Montevideo, Paranaguá, Rio Grande, Fortaleza, Belém and Maracaibo.\n\n\nAbout ports, Brazil has some of the busiest seaports in South America, such as Port of Santos, Port of Rio de Janeiro, Port of Paranaguá, Port of Itajaí, Port of Rio Grande, Port of São Francisco do Sul and Suape Port. Argentina has ports such as Port of Buenos Aires and Port of Rosario. Chile has important ports in Valparaíso, Caldera, Mejillones, Antofagasta, Iquique, Arica and Puerto Montt. Colombia has important ports such as Buenaventura, Cartagena Container Terminal and Puerto Bolivar. Peru has important ports in Callao, Ilo and Matarani. The 15 busiest ports in South America are: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de Cartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires (Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itajaí (Brazil), Valparaíso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranaguá (Brazil), Rio Grande (Brazil), São Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).[235]\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nTwo primary railroads are continental: the Transandina, which connects Buenos Aires, in Argentina to Valparaíso, in Chile, and the Brazil–Bolivia Railroad, which makes it the connection between the port of Santos in Brazil and the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, in Bolivia.\n\n\nTwo areas of greater density occur in the railway sector: the platinum network, which develops around the Platine region, largely belonging to Argentina, with more than 45,000 km in length; And the Southeast Brazil network, which mainly serves the state of São Paulo, state of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais.\n\n\nThe Argentine rail network, with 47,000 km of tracks, and at one stage was one of the largest in the world and continues to be the most extensive in Latin America. It came to have about 100,000 km of rails, but the lifting of tracks and the emphasis placed on motor transport gradually reduced it. It has four different trails and international connections with Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay. The Brazilian railway network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It's basically used for transporting ores.[236] Chile has almost 7,000 km of railways, with connections to Argentina, Bolivia and Peru. Colombia has about 3,500 km of railways.[237]\n\n\n\n#### Waterways[edit]\n\n\nSouth America has one of the largest bays of navigable inland waterways in the world, represented mainly by the Amazon basin, the Platine basin, the São Francisco and the Orinoco basins, Brazil having about 54,000 km navigable, while Argentina has 6,500 km and Venezuela, 1,200 km.\n\n\nAmong the main Brazilian waterways, two stand out: Hidrovia Tietê-Paraná (which has a length of 2,400 km, 1,600 on the Paraná River and 800 km on the Tietê River, draining agricultural production from the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás and part of Rondônia, Tocantins and Minas Gerais) and Hidrovia do Solimões-Amazonas (it has two sections: Solimões, which extends from Tabatinga to Manaus, with approximately 1600 km, and Amazonas, which extends from Manaus to Belém, with 1650 km. Almost entirely passenger transport from the Amazon plain is done by this waterway, in addition to practically all cargo transportation that is directed to the major regional centers of Belém and Manaus). In Brazil, this transport is still underused: the most important waterway stretches, from an economic point of view, are found in the Southeast and South of the country. Its full use still depends on the construction of locks, major dredging works and, mainly, of ports that allow intermodal integration. In Argentina, the waterway network is made up of the La Plata, Paraná, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers. The main river ports are Zárate and Campana. The port of Buenos Aires is historically the first in individual importance, but the area known as Up-River, which stretches along 67 km of the Santa Fé portion of the Paraná River, brings together 17 ports that concentrate 50% of the total exports of the country.\n\n\n\n#### Public transport[edit]\n\n\nThe main public transport in major cities is the bus. Many cities also have a diverse system of metro and subway trains, the first of which was the Buenos Aires subte, opened 1913.[238] The Santiago subway[239] is the largest network in South America, with 103 km, while the São Paulo subway is the most heavily used, with more than 4.6 million passengers per day[240] and was voted the best in the Americas.

It can also be described as the southern subregion of a single continent called America.\n\n\nSouth America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. The continent generally includes twelve sovereign states: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela; two dependent territories: the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands;[i] and one internal territory: French Guiana.[j] In addition, the ABC islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Ascension Island (dependency of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, a British Overseas Territory), Bouvet Island (dependency of Norway), Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago may also be considered parts of South America.\n\n\nSouth America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its population as of 2021[update] has been estimated at more than 434 million.[1][2] South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with almost half of the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru. In recent decades, Brazil has also generated half of the continent's GDP and has become the continent's first regional power.[9]\n\n\nMost of the population lives near the continent's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the far south are sparsely populated. The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes mountains; in contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and vast lowlands where rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco and Paraná flow. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of the Southern Cone located in the middle latitudes.\n\n\nThe continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of indigenous peoples with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long history of colonialism, the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak Spanish or Portuguese, and societies and states are rich in Western traditions. Relative to Europe, Asia and Africa, post-1900 South America has been a peaceful continent with few wars.[10][11][k]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of South America\n\nSee also: Category:Environment of South America\n\n![](image)A composite relief image of South America\n![](image)Modern political map of South America\nSouth America occupies the southern portion of the Americas. The continent is generally delimited on the northwest by the Darién watershed along the Colombia–Panama border, although some may consider the border instead to be the Panama Canal. Geopolitically[13] and geographically, all of Panama – including the segment east of the Panama Canal in the isthmus – is typically included in North America alone[14][15][16] and among the countries of Central America.[17][18] Almost all of mainland South America sits on the South American Plate.\n\n\nSouth America is home to several superlatives, including, the world's second highest uninterrupted waterfall, Angel Falls in Venezuela; the highest single-drop waterfall Kaieteur Falls in Guyana; the largest river by volume, the Amazon River; the longest mountain range, the Andes (whose highest mountain is Aconcagua at 6,962 m or 22,841 ft); the driest non-polar place on earth, the Atacama Desert;[19][20][21] the wettest place on earth, López de Micay in Colombia; the largest rainforest, the Amazon rainforest; the highest capital city, La Paz, Bolivia; the highest commercially navigable lake in the world, Lake Titicaca; and, excluding research stations in Antarctica, the world's southernmost permanently inhabited community, Puerto Toro, Chile.\n\n\nSouth America's major mineral resources are gold, silver, copper, iron ore, tin, and petroleum. These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export commodity often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.\n\n\nBrazil is the largest country in South America, covering a little less than half of the continent's land area and encompassing around half of the continent's population.[22] The remaining countries and territories are divided among four subregions: the Andean states, Caribbean South America, The Guianas, and the Southern Cone.[23]\n\n\n\n### Outlying islands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Gran Roque village, the largest settlement of the Los Roques Archipelago, Venezuela\nPhysiographically, South America also includes some of the nearby islands. The Dutch ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao), the islands of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad Island and Tobago Island etc.), the State of Nueva Esparta, and the Federal Dependencies of Venezuela sit on the northern portion of the South American continental shelf and are sometimes considered parts of the continent. Geopolitically, all the island countries and territories in the Caribbean have generally been grouped as a subregion of North America instead. By contrast, Aves Island (administered by Venezuela) and the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina (San Andrés Island, Providencia Island, and Santa Catalina Island etc., which are administered by Colombia) are politically parts of South American countries but physiographically parts of North America.[16][24][25]\n\n\nOther islands often associated with geopolitical South America are the Chiloé Archipelago and Robinson Crusoe Island (both administered by Chile), Easter Island (culturally a part of Oceania, also administered by Chile),[26] the Galápagos Islands (administered by Ecuador, sometimes considered part of Oceania),[26][27][28] and Tierra del Fuego (split between Argentina and Chile). In the Atlantic Ocean, Brazil administers Fernando de Noronha, Trindade and Martim Vaz, and the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, while the Falkland Islands (Spanish: *Islas Malvinas*) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (biogeographically and hydrologically associated with Antarctica)[29] have been administered as two British Overseas Territories under the Crown, whose sovereignty over the islands is disputed by Argentina.\n\n\n\n#### Special cases[edit]\n\n\nAn isolated volcanic island on the South American Plate, Ascension Island is geologically a part of South America.[30] Administered as a dependency of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, the island is geopolitically a part of Africa.\n\n\nAn uninhabited sub-Antarctic volcanic island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, Bouvet Island (administered by Norway) is geographically, geologically, biogeographically, and hydrologically associated with Antarctica, but the United Nations geoscheme has included the territory in South America instead.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for South America[31]\nAll of the world's major climate zones are present in South America.[32]\n\n\nThe distribution of the average temperatures in the region presents a constant regularity from the 30° of latitude south, when the isotherms tend, more and more, to be confused with the degrees of latitude.[33]\n\n\nIn temperate latitudes, winters and summers are milder than in North America. This is because the most extensive part of the continent is in the equatorial zone (the region has more areas of equatorial plains than any other region),[33] therefore giving the Southern Cone more oceanic influence, which moderates year round temperatures.\n\n\nThe average annual temperatures in the Amazon basin oscillate around 27 °C (81 °F), with low thermal amplitudes and high rainfall indices. Between the Maracaibo Lake and the mouth of the Orinoco, predominates an equatorial climate of the type Congolese, that also includes parts of the Brazilian territory.[33]\n\n\nThe east-central Brazilian plateau has a humid and warm tropical climate. The northern and eastern parts of the Argentine pampas have a humid subtropical climate with dry winters and humid summers of the Chinese type, while the western and eastern ranges have a subtropical climate of the dinaric type. At the highest points of the Andean region, climates are colder than the ones occurring at the highest point of the Norwegian fjords. In the Andean plateaus, the warm climate prevails, although it is tempered by the altitude, while in the coastal strip, there is an equatorial climate of the Guinean type. From this point until the north of the Chilean coast appear, successively, Mediterranean oceanic climate, temperate of the Breton type and, already in Tierra del Fuego, cold climate of the Siberian type.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of all tropical cyclone tracks from 1945 to 2006\nThe distribution of rainfall is related to the regime of winds and air masses. In most of the tropical region east of the Andes, winds blowing from the northeast, east and southeast carry moisture from the Atlantic, causing abundant rainfall. However, due to a consistently strong wind shear and a weak Intertropical Convergence Zone, South Atlantic tropical cyclones are rare.[34] In the Orinoco Llanos and in the Guianas Plateau, the precipitation levels go from moderate to high. The Pacific coast of Colombia and northern Ecuador are rainy regions, with Chocó in Colombia being the rainiest place in the world along with the northern slopes of Indian Himalayas.[35] The Atacama Desert, along this stretch of coast, is one of the driest regions in the world. The central and southern parts of Chile are subject to extratropical cyclones, and most of the Argentine Patagonia is desert. In the Pampas of Argentina, Uruguay and South of Brazil the rainfall is moderate, with rains well distributed during the year. The moderately dry conditions of the Chaco oppose the intense rainfall of the eastern region of Paraguay. In the semiarid coast of the Brazilian Northeast the rains are linked to a monsoon regime.[33]\n\n\nImportant factors in the determination of climates are sea currents, such as the current Humboldt and Falklands. The equatorial current of the South Atlantic strikes the coast of the Northeast and there is divided into two others: the current of Brazil and a coastal current that flows to the northwest towards the Antilles, where there it moves towards northeast course thus forming the most Important and famous ocean current in the world, the Gulf Stream.[33][36]\n\n\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\nSouth America is one of the most biodiverse continents on Earth. South America is home to many unique species of animals including the llama, anaconda, piranha, jaguar, vicuña, and tapir. The Amazon rainforests possess high biodiversity, with Brazil estimated to contain 10% of Earth's species.[37] 83% of South America's large mammals (megafauna) became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene around 11,000 years ago as part of the Quaternary extinction event, among the highest of any continent, with the casualties including saber-toothed cats, ground sloths, glyptodonts, gomphotheres, the equines *Hippidion* and *Equus neogeus*, and all remaining South American native ungulates.[38]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of South America\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of South America § Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)The prehistoric Cueva de las Manos, or \"Cave of the Hands\", in Argentina\nSouth America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the Bering Land Bridge (now the Bering Strait) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia. They migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the Isthmus of Panama.\n\n\nAmongst the oldest evidence for human presence in South America is the Monte Verde II site in Chile, suggested to date to around 14,500 years ago.[39] From around 13,000 years ago, the Fishtail projectile point style became widespread across South America, with its disppearance around 11,000 years ago coincident with the disappearance of South America's megafauna.[40] Maize was present in northern South America by around 6,000 years ago.[41]\n\n\nBy 2000 BC, many agrarian communities had been settled throughout the Andes and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an agrarian society.[42]\n\n\nSouth American cultures began domesticating llamas, vicuñas, guanacos, and alpacas in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.[42]\n\n\n\n### Pre-Columbian civilizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pre-Columbian era § South America\n\n![](image)The Inca estate of Machu Picchu, Peru is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\nThe rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.\n\n\nOne of the earliest known South American civilizations was at Caral-Supe, on the central Peruvian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Caral-Supe created one of the first cities of the world, generally dated to around 3500 BC, at Huaricanga in the Fortaleza area, contemporaneous with the pyramids of Ancient Egypt, one of the oldest-known civilization in the Americas and one of the six sites where civilisation separately originated in the ancient world.[43] Caral-Supe governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by Chavín by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín de Huantar in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters (10,423 ft). Chavín civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.\n\n\nIn the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, Moche (100 BC – 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), Paracas and Nazca (400 BC – 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through irrigation and new styles of ceramic art. At the Altiplano, Tiahuanaco or Tiwanaku (100 BC – 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion.\n\n\nAround the 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or Huari Empire (600–1200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and Tiahuanaco religious iconography.\n\n\nThe Muisca were the main indigenous civilization in what is now Colombia. They established the Muisca Confederation of many clans, or *cacicazgos*, that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.\n\n\nOther important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the Cañaris (in south central Ecuador), Chimú Empire (1300–1470, Peruvian northern coast), Chachapoyas, and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000–1450, Western Bolivia and southern Peru).\nHolding their capital at the great city of Cusco, the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as *Tawantin suyu*, and \"the land of the four regions,\" in Quechua, the Inca Empire was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some nine to fourteen million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer road system. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture.\n\n\nThe Mapuche in Central and Southern Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the Arauco War for more than 300 years.\n\n\n\n\n### European colonization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Spanish colonization of the Americas and Portuguese colonization of the Americas\n\n![](image)Woodcut depicting Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci's first voyage (1497–98) to the New World, from the first known published edition of Vespucci's 1504 letter to Piero Soderini\nIn 1494, Portugal and Spain, the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive duopoly between the two countries.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Inca–Spanish confrontation in the Battle of Cajamarca left thousands of natives dead.\nThe treaty established an imaginary line along a north–south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, roughly 46° 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of longitude were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian.\n\n\nBeginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign conquistadors, first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it into colonies.\n\n\nEuropean infectious diseases (smallpox, influenza, measles, and typhus) – to which the native populations had no immune resistance – caused large-scale depopulation of the native population under Spanish control. Systems of forced labor, such as the haciendas and mining industry's mit'a also contributed to the depopulation. After this, enslaved Africans, who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the Americas in 1790\nThe Spaniards were committed to converting their native subjects to Christianity and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended Catholicism with their established beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the Roman Catholic Church's evangelization in Quechua, Aymara, and Guaraní actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.\n\n\nEventually, the natives and the Spaniards interbred, forming a mestizo class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral landing in Brazil in 1500\nMany native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of Latin American.\n\n\nGuyana was initially colonized by the Dutch before coming under British control, though there was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was occupied by the French. The region was initially partitioned between the Dutch, French and British before fully coming under the control of Britain.\n\n\n\n![](image)Dutch colonial houses in Paramaribo, Suriname\nSuriname was first explored by the Spanish in the 16th century and then settled by the English in the mid-17th century. It became a Dutch colony in 1667.[45]\n\n\n\n### Slavery in South America[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas and Atlantic slave trade\n\n![](image)Public

European colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The Atlantic slave trade brought enslaved Africans primarily to South American colonies, beginning with the Portuguese since 1502.[46] The main destinations of this phase were the Caribbean colonies and Brazil, as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the New World. Nearly 40% of all African slaves trafficked to the Americas went to Brazil. An estimated 4.9 million slaves from Africa came to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.[47][48]\n\n\nIn contrast to other European colonies in the Americas which mainly used the labor of African slaves, Spanish colonists mainly enslaved indigenous Americans. In 1750, the Portuguese Crown abolished the enslavement of indigenous peoples in colonial Brazil, under the belief that they were unfit for labor and less effective than enslaved Africans. Enslaved Africans were brought to the Americas on slave ships, under inhuman conditions and ill-treatment, and those who survived were sold in slave markets.[49] After independence, all South American countries maintained slavery for some time. The first South American country to abolish slavery was Chile in 1823, Uruguay in 1830, Bolivia in 1831, Colombia and Ecuador in 1851, Argentina in 1853, Peru and Venezuela in 1854, Suriname in 1863, Paraguay in 1869, and in 1888 Brazil was the last South American nation and the last country in western world to abolish slavery.[50]\n\n\n\n### Independence from Spain and Portugal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Spanish American wars of independence and Independence of Brazil\n\nThe European Peninsular War (1807–1814), a theater of the Napoleonic Wars, changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the House of Braganza avoided capture by escaping to Brazil. Napoleon also captured King Ferdinand VII of Spain, and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created Juntas to rule in the name of the captured king.\n\n\n\n![](image)The proclamation of the Independence of Brazil by Prince Pedro on 7 September 1822\n![](image)The Guayaquil conference between José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar\n![](image)Coronation of Pedro I as 1st Emperor of Brazil\n![](image)Bernardo O'Higgins swears officially the independence of Chile.\nMany cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the Spanish American wars of independence between the patriots, who promoted such autonomy, and the royalists, who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the Enlightenment. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the Absolutist Restoration as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict.\n\n\nThe independence of South America was secured by Simón Bolívar (Venezuela) and José de San Martín (Argentina), the two most important *Libertadores*. Bolívar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards Lima, the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Meanwhile, San Martín led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.\n\n\nIn the Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil, Dom Pedro I (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King Dom João VI, proclaimed the independent Kingdom of Brazil in 1822, which later became the Empire of Brazil. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in Bahia, Cisplatina and Pará, independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal in 1825, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil mediatized by the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n### Nation-building and fragmentation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Thirty-Three Orientals proclaimed the independence of Cisplatine Province.\n![](image)Battle of Fanfa, battle scene in Southern Brazil during the Ragamuffin War\nThe newly independent nations began a process of fragmentation, with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern times (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the Republic of Entre Ríos and the Riograndense Republic).\n\n\nThe first separatist attempt was in 1820 by the Argentine province of Entre Ríos, led by a caudillo.[51] In spite of the \"Republic\" in its title, General Ramírez, its caudillo, never really intended to declare an independent Entre Rios. Rather, he was making a political statement in opposition to the monarchist and centralist ideas that back then permeated Buenos Aires politics. The \"country\" was reincorporated at the United Provinces in 1821.\n\n\nIn 1825 the Cisplatine Province declared its independence from the Empire of Brazil, which led to the Cisplatine War between the imperials and the Argentine from the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata to control the region. Three years later, the United Kingdom intervened in the question by proclaiming a tie and creating in the former Cisplatina a new independent country: The Oriental Republic of Uruguay.\n\n\nLater in 1836, while Brazil was experiencing the chaos of the regency, Rio Grande do Sul proclaimed its independence motivated by a tax crisis. With the anticipation of the coronation of Pedro II to the throne of Brazil, the country could stabilize and fight the separatists, which the province of Santa Catarina had joined in 1839. The Conflict came to an end by a process of compromise by which both Riograndense Republic and Juliana Republic were reincorporated as provinces in 1845.[52][53]\n\n\nThe Peru–Bolivian Confederation, a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the War of the Confederation (1836–1839) and again during the War of the Pacific (1879–1883). Paraguay was virtually destroyed by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay in the Paraguayan War.\n\n\n\n### Wars and conflicts[edit]\n\n\nDespite the Spanish American wars of independence and the Brazilian War of Independence, the new nations quickly began to suffer with internal conflicts and wars among themselves. Most of the 1810 borders countries had initially accepted on the *uti possidetis iuris* principle had by 1848 either been altered by war or were contested.[54]\n\n\nIn 1825 the proclamation of independence of Cisplatina led to the Cisplatine War between historical rivals the Empire of Brazil and the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Argentina's predecessor. The result was a stalemate, ending with the British government arranging for the independence of Uruguay. Soon after, another Brazilian province proclaimed its independence leading to the Ragamuffin War which Brazil won.\n\n\nBetween 1836 and 1839 the War of the Confederation broke out between the short-lived Peru-Bolivian Confederation and Chile, with the support of the Argentine Confederation. The war was fought mostly in the actual territory of Peru and ended with a Confederate defeat and the dissolution of the Confederacy and annexation of many territories by Argentina.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Argentine Civil Wars plagued Argentina since its independence. The conflict was mainly between those who defended the centralization of power in Buenos Aires and those who defended a confederation. During this period it can be said that \"there were two Argentines\": the Argentine Confederation and the Argentine Republic. At the same time, the political instability in Uruguay led to the Uruguayan Civil War among the main political factions of the country. All this instability in the platine region interfered with the goals of other countries such as Brazil, which was soon forced to take sides. In 1851 the Brazilian Empire, supporting the centralizing unitarians, and the Uruguayan government invaded Argentina and deposed the caudillo, Juan Manuel Rosas, who ruled the confederation with an iron hand. Although the Platine War did not put an end to the political chaos and civil war in Argentina, it brought temporary peace to Uruguay where the Colorados faction won, supported by Brazil, Britain, France and the Unitarian Party of Argentina.[55]\n\n\nPeace lasted only a short time: in 1864 the Uruguayan factions faced each other again in the Uruguayan War. The Blancos supported by Paraguay started to attack Brazilian and Argentine farmers near the borders. The Empire made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados without success. In 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, the imperial government declared that Brazil's military would begin reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and, for most of its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war which led to the deposition of the *Blancos* and the rise of the pro-Brazilian *Colorados* to power again. This angered the Paraguayan government, which even before the end of the war invaded Brazil, beginning the longest and bloodiest inter-state war in Latin American history: the Paraguayan War.[56]\n\n\nThe Paraguayan War began when the Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano López ordered the invasion of the Brazilian provinces of Mato Grosso and Rio Grande do Sul. His attempt to cross Argentinian territory without Argentinian approval led the pro-Brazilian Argentine government into the war. The pro-Brazilian Uruguayan government showed its support by sending troops. In 1865 the three countries signed the Treaty of the Triple Alliance against Paraguay. At the beginning of the war, the Paraguayans took the lead with several victories, until the Triple Alliance organized to repel the invaders and fight effectively. This was the second total war experience in the world after the American Civil War. It was deemed the greatest war effort in the history of all participating countries, taking almost 6 years and ending with the complete devastation of Paraguay. The country lost 40% of its territory to Brazil and Argentina and lost 60% of its population, including 90% of the men. The dictator Lopez was killed in battle and a new government was instituted in alliance with Brazil, which maintained occupation forces in the country until 1876.[57]\n\n\nThe last South American war in the 19th century was the War of the Pacific with Bolivia and Peru on one side and Chile on the other. In 1879 the war began with Chilean troops occupying Bolivian ports, followed by Bolivia declaring war on Chile which activated an alliance treaty with Peru. The Bolivians were completely defeated in 1880 and Lima was occupied in 1881. Peace was signed with Peru in 1883 while a truce was signed with Bolivia in 1884. Chile annexed territories of both countries leaving Bolivia landlocked.[58]\n\n\nIn the new century, as wars became less violent and less frequent, Brazil entered into a small conflict with Bolivia for the possession of the Acre, which was acquired by Brazil in 1902. In 1917 Brazil declared war on the Central Powers, joined the allied side in the First World War and sent a small fleet to the Mediterranean Sea and some troops to be integrated with the British and French forces in the region. Brazil was the only South American country that participated in the First World War.[59][60] Later in 1932 Colombia and Peru entered a short armed conflict for territory in the Amazon. In the same year Paraguay declared war on Bolivia for possession of the Chaco, in a conflict that ended three years later with Paraguay's victory. Between 1941 and 1942 Peru and Ecuador fought for territories claimed by both that were annexed by Peru, usurping Ecuador's frontier with Brazil.[61]\n\n\nAlso in this period, the first major naval battle of World War II took place in the South Atlantic close to the continental mainland: the Battle of the River Plate, between a British cruiser squadron and a German pocket battleship.[62] The Germans still made numerous attacks on Brazilian ships on the coast, causing Brazil to declare war on the Axis powers in 1942, being the only South American country to fight in this war (and in both World Wars). Brazil sent naval and air forces to combat German and Italian submarines off the continent and throughout the South Atlantic, in addition to sending an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian Campaign.[63][64]\n\n\nA brief war was fought between Argentina and the UK in 1982, following an Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, which ended with an Argentine defeat. The last international war to be fought on South American soil was the 1995 Cenepa War between Ecuador and the Peru along their mutual border.\n\n\n\n* ![Imperial Brazilian Navy siege of Paysandú, 1865](image)\n\nImperial Brazilian Navy siege of Paysandú, 1865\n* ![The Uruguayan Army at the Battle of Sauce, 1866](image)\n\nThe Uruguayan Army at the Battle of Sauce, 1866\n* ![The Imperial Brazilian Army during a procession in Paraguay, 1868](image)\n\nThe Imperial Brazilian Army during a procession in Paraguay, 1868\n* ![The Chilean Army in the battlefield of the Battle of Chorrillos, 1883](image)\n\nThe Chilean Army in the battlefield of the Battle of Chorrillos, 1883\n* ![A German submarine under attack by Brazilian Air Force PBY Catalina, 31 July 1943`](image)\n\nA German submarine under attack by Brazilian Air Force PBY Catalina, 31 July 1943`\n\n\n### Rise and fall of military dictatorships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Argentine soldiers during the Falklands War\nWars became less frequent in the 20th century, with Bolivia-Paraguay and Peru-Ecuador fighting the last inter-state wars. Early in the 20th century, the three wealthiest South American countries engaged in a vastly expensive naval arms race which began after the introduction of a new warship type, the \"dreadnought\". At one point, the Argentine government was spending a fifth of its entire yearly budget for just two dreadnoughts, a price that did not include later in-service costs, which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial purchase.[65][66]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Brazilian *Minas Geraes* class kindled an Argentine–Brazilian–Chilean naval arms race.\nThe continent became a battlefield of the Cold War in the late 20th century. Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of whom were tortured or killed on inter-state collaboration. Economically, they began a transition to neoliberal economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of \"National Security\" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an internal conflict.\n\n\nIn 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, a British dependent territory. The Falklands War began and 74 days later Argentine forces surrendered.[67]\n\n\nColombia has had an ongoing, though diminished internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation of Marxist guerrillas (FARC-EP) and then involved several illegal armed groups of leftist-leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords. Many of these are now defunct, and only a small portion of the ELN remains, along with the stronger, though also greatly reduced, FARC.\n\n\nRevolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships became common after World War II, but since the 1980s, a wave of democratization passed through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.[68] Nonetheless, allegations of corruption are still very common, and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments, although, on most occasions, regular civilian succession has continued.\n\n\n\n![](image)Presidents of UNASUR member states at the Second Brasília Summit on 23 May 2008\nInternational indebtedness turned into a severe problem in the late 1980s, and some countries, despite having strong democracies, have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without resorting to unorthodox economic policies, as most recently illustrated by Argentina's default in the early 21st century.[69][*neutrality is disputed*] The last twenty years have seen an increased push towards regional integration, with the creation of uniquely South American institutions such as the Andean Community, Mercosur and Unasur. Notably, starting with the election of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela in 1998, the region experienced what has been termed a pink tide[*citation needed*] – the election of several leftist and center-left administrations to most countries of the area, except for the Guianas and Colombia.\n\n\n\n### Contemporary issues[edit]\n\n\nSouth America's political geography since the 1990s has been characterized by a desire to reduce foreign influence.[70] The nationalization of industries, by which the state controls entire economic sectors (as opposed of private companies doing it), has become a prominent political issues in the region.[70] Some South American nations have nationalized their electricity industries.[70]\n\n\n\n## Countries and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of sovereign states and dependent territories in South America\n\n\n\n| Flag | Country / Territory | Area[l] | Population(2021)[1][2] | Populationdensity | Capital | Name(s) in official language(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Argentina | 2,766,890 km2(1,068,300 sq mi)\n | 45,276,780\n | 14.3/km2(37/sq mi)\n | Buenos Aires | Argentina\n |\n| ![](image) | Bolivia | 1,098,580 km2(424,160 sq mi)\n | 12,079,472\n | 8.4/km2(22/sq mi)\n | La Paz,Sucre[m] | Bolivia/Mborivia/Wuliwya/Puliwya\n |\n| ![](image) | Brazil | 8,514,877 km2(3,287,612 sq mi)\n | 214,326,223\n | 22/km2(57/sq mi)\n | Brasília | Brasil\n |\n| ![](image) | Chile[n] | 756,950 km2(292,260 sq mi)\n | 19,493,184\n | 22/km2(57/sq mi)\n | Santiago[o] | Chile\n |\n| ![](image) | Colombia | 1,141,748 km2(440,831 sq mi)\n | 51,516,562\n | 40/km2(100/sq mi)\n | Bogotá | Colombia\n |\n| ![](image) | Ecuador | 283,560 km2(109,480 sq mi)\n | 17,797,737\n | 53.8/km2(139/sq mi)\n | Quito | Ecuador/Ikwayur/Ekuatur\n |\n| ![](image) | Falkland Islands(United Kingdom)\n | 12,173 km2(4,700 sq mi)\n | 3,764\n | 0.26/km2(0.67/sq mi)\n | Stanley | Falkland Islands\n |\n| ![](image) | French Guiana(France)\n | 91,000 km2(35,000 sq mi)\n | 297,449\n | 2.1/km2(5.4/sq mi)\n | Cayenne(Préfecture)\n | Guyane\n |\n| ![](image) | Guyana | 214,999 km2(83,012 sq mi)\n | 804,567\n | 3.5/km2(9.1/sq mi)\n | Georgetown | Guyana\n |\n| ![](image) | Paraguay | 406,750 km2(157,050 sq mi)\n | 6,703,799\n | 15.6/km2(40/sq mi)\n | Asunción | Paraguay/Paraguái\n |\n| ![](image) | Peru | 1,285,220 km2(496,230 sq mi)\n | 33,715,471\n | 22/km2(57/sq mi)\n | Lima | Perú/Piruw/Piruw\n |\n| ![](image) | South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands(United Kingdom)[p] | 3,093 km2(1,194 sq mi)\n | 20\n | 0/km2(0/sq mi)\n | King Edward Point | South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\n |\n| ![](image) | Suriname | 163,270 km2(63,040 sq mi)\n | 612,985\n | 3/km2(7.8/sq mi)\n | Paramaribo | Suriname\n |\n| ![](image) | Uruguay | 176,220 km2(68,040 sq mi)\n | 3,426,260\n | 19.4/km2(50/sq mi)\n | Montevideo | Uruguay/Uruguai\n |\n| ![](image) | Venezuela | 916,445 km2(353,841 sq mi)\n | 28,199,867\n | 27.8/km2(72/sq mi)\n | Caracas | Venezuela\n |\n| Total\n | 17,824,513 km2(6,882,083 sq mi)\n | 434,254,119\n | 21.5/km2(56/sq mi)\n |  |\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the UNASUR in Quito, Ecuador\n![](image)Scheme for geographic regions and subregions used by the United Nations Statistics Division\n![](image)South American flags\nHistorically, the Hispanic countries were founded as Republican dictatorships led by caudillos. Brazil was the only exception, being a constitutional monarchy for its first 67 years of independence, until a coup d'état proclaimed a republic. In the late 19th century, the most democratic countries were Brazil,[71] Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.[72]\n\n\nAll South American countries are presidential republics with the exception of Suriname, a parliamentary republic. French Guiana is a French overseas department, while the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are British overseas territories. It is currently the only inhabited continent in the world without monarchies; the Empire of Brazil existed during the 19th century and there was an unsuccessful attempt to establish a Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia in southern Argentina and Chile. Also in the twentieth century, Suriname was established as a constituent kingdom of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Guyana retained the British monarch as head of state for 4 years after its independence.\n\n\nRecently, an intergovernmental entity has been formed which aims to merge the two existing customs unions: Mercosur and the Andean Community, thus forming the third-largest trade bloc in the world.[73]\nThis new political organization, known as Union of South American Nations, seeks to establish free movement of people, economic development, a common defense policy and the elimination of tariffs.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of South America\n\nSee also: List of South American countries by population and List of South American countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Satellite view of South America at night from NASA, showing the contrast between heavily populated coastal areas and the more remote regions of the Amazonian interior and Patagonia\nSouth America has a population of over 428 million people. They are distributed as to form a \"hollow continent\" with most of the population concentrated around the margins of the continent.[70] On one hand, there are several sparsely populated areas such as tropical forests, the Atacama Desert and the icy portions of Patagonia. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly Spaniards, Portuguese and Italians), Africans and Amerindians. There is a high percentage of Mestizos that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of Asians,[*further explanation needed*] especially in Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. The two main languages are by far Spanish and Portuguese, followed by English, French and Dutch in smaller numbers.\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of South America\n\n![](image)Official languages in South America\nSpanish and Portuguese are the most spoken languages in South America, with approximately 200 million speakers each. Spanish is the official language of most countries, along with other native languages in some countries. Portuguese is the official language of Brazil. Dutch is the official language of Suriname; English is the official language of Guyana, although there are at least twelve other languages spoken in the country, including Portuguese, Chinese, Hindustani and several native languages.[74] English is also spoken in the Falkland Islands. French is the official language of French Guiana and the second language in Amapá, Brazil.\n\n\nIndigenous languages of South America include Quechua in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Colombia; Wayuunaiki in northern Colombia (La Guajira) and northwestern Venezuela (Zulia); Guaraní in Paraguay and, to a much lesser extent, in Bolivia; Aymara in Bolivia, Peru, and less often in Chile; and Mapudungun is spoken in certain pockets of southern Chile. At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.\n\n\nOther languages found in South America include Hindustani and Javanese in Suriname; Italian in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela; and German in certain pockets of Argentina and Brazil. German is also spoken in many regions of the southern states of Brazil, Riograndenser Hunsrückisch being the most widely spoken German dialect in the country; among other Germanic dialects, a Brazilian form of East Pomeranian is also well represented and is experiencing a revival. Welsh remains spoken and written in the historic towns of Trelew and Rawson in the Argentine Patagonia. Arabic speakers, often of Lebanese, Syrian, or Palestinian descent, can be found in Arab communities in Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela and in Paraguay.[75]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Las Lajas Sanctuary, Ipiales, Colombia\nMain articles: Religion in South America and Religion in Latin America\n\nSee also: History of the Jews in Latin America and the Caribbean, Buddhism in Brazil, and Islam in Argentina\n\nAn estimated 90% of South Americans are Christians[76] (82% Roman Catholic, 8% other Christian denominations mainly traditional Protestants and Evangelicals but also Orthodox), accounting for 19% of Christians worldwide.\n\n\nAfrican descendent religions and Indigenous religions are also common throughout all South America; some examples of are Santo Daime, Candomblé, and Umbanda.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nCrypto-Jews or Marranos, conversos, and Anusim were an important part of colonial life in Latin America.\n\n\nBoth Buenos Aires, Argentina and São Paulo, Brazil figure among the largest Jewish populations by urban area.\n\n\nEast Asian religions such as Japanese Buddhism, Shintoism, and Shinto-derived Japanese New Religions are common in Brazil and Peru. Korean Confucianism is especially found in Brazil while Chinese Buddhism and Chinese Confucianism have spread throughout the continent.\n\n\nKardecist Spiritism can be found in several countries.\n\n\nHindus form 25% of the Guyanese population and 22% of Suriname's.[77][78]\n\n\nMuslims account for 6.8% of the Guyanese population and 13.9 of the Surinamese population.[77][78] Almost all Muslims in Suriname are either Indonesian or Indians and in Guyana, most are Indian.\n\n\n**Part of Religions in South America (2013):[79]**\n\n\n\n\n\nReligion in South America\n| Countries\n | Christians\n | *Roman Catholics* | *Other Christians* | No religion (atheists and agnostics)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Argentina | 88% | 77% | 11% | 11%\n |\n| Bolivia | 96% | 74% | 22% | 4%\n |\n| Brazil | 88% | 64% | 22% | 8%\n |\n| Chile | 70% | 57% | 13% | 25%\n |\n| Colombia | 92% | 80% | 12% | 7%\n |\n| Paraguay | 96% | 87% | 9% | 2%\n |\n| Peru | 94% | 81% | 13% | 3%\n |\n| Suriname | 51% | 29% | 22% | 5%\n |\n| Uruguay | 58% | 47% | 11% | 41%\n |\n| Venezuela | 88% | 71% | 17% | 8%\n |\n\n\n### Ethnic demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in South America\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **possibly contains original research**.

In Argentina, the European influence accounts for 65–79% of the genetic background, Amerindian for 17–31% and sub-Saharan African for 2–4%. In Colombia, the sub-Saharan African genetic background varied from 1% to 89%, while the European genetic background varied from 20% to 79%, depending on the region.\nIn Peru, European ancestries ranged from 1% to 31%, while the African contribution was only 1% to 3%.[80] The Genographic Project determined the average Peruvian from Lima had about 25% European ancestry, 68% Native American, 3% Southwest Asian ancestry and 2% sub-Saharan African.[81]\n\n\nDescendants of indigenous peoples, such as the Quechua and Aymara, or the Urarina[82] of Amazonia make up the majority of the population in Bolivia (56%) and Peru (44%).[83][84] In Ecuador, Amerindians are a large minority that comprises two-fifths of the population. The native European population is also a significant element in most other former Portuguese colonies.\n\n\nPeople who identify as of primarily or totally European descent, or identify their phenotype as corresponding to such group, are a majority in Argentina,[85] Uruguay[86] and Chile (64.7%),[87] and are 48.4% of the population in Brazil.[88][89][90] In Venezuela, according to the national census, 42% of the population is primarily native Spanish, Italian and Portuguese descendants.[91] In Colombia, people who identify as European descendants are about 37%.[92][93] In Peru, European descendants are the third group in number (15%).[94]\n\n\nMestizos (mixed European and Amerindian) are the largest ethnic group in Bolivia, Paraguay, Venezuela, Colombia[92] and Ecuador and the second group in Peru and Chile.\n\n\nSouth America is also home to one of the largest populations of Africans. This group is significantly present in Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Venezuela and Ecuador.\n\n\nBrazil followed by Peru have the largest Japanese, Korean and Chinese communities in South America, Lima has the largest ethnic Chinese community in Latin America.[95] Guyana and Suriname have the largest ethnic East Indian community.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnic distribution in South America[96][97][98]\n| Country\n | Amerindians | White people | Mestizos / Pardos | Mulatos | Black people | Zambos | Asian people |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Argentina\n | 1% | **85**% | 14% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0%\n |\n| Bolivia\n | **48**% | 12% | 37% | 2% | 0% | <1% | 0%\n |\n| Brazil\n | <1% | **48**% | 43% | 0% | 8% | 0% | 2%\n |\n| Chile\n | 6% | **69**% | 25% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0%\n |\n| Colombia\n | 2% | 37% | **50**% | 8% | 2% | 0% | <1%\n |\n| Ecuador\n | 39% | 10% | **41**% | 5% | 5% | 0% | 0%\n |\n| Paraguay\n | 3% | 20% | **75**% | 4% | 0% | 0% | 0%\n |\n| Peru\n | **45**% | 15% | 35% | 2% | 0% | 0% | 3%\n |\n| Suriname\n | 3.8% | 1% | 13.4%\\* noted in Suriname as mixed, regardless of race combination | \\*see Pardo | 37.4% | \\*see Pardo | **48.3**%\n |\n| Uruguay\n | 0% | **88**% | 8% | 4% | 0% | 0% | 0%\n |\n| Venezuela\n | 2.7% | 43.6% | **51.6%** | 0.7% | 2.8% | 0.6% | 0.6%\n |\n| Guyana\n | 10.5%\n | 0.36%\n | 19.9%\\* noted in Guyana as mixed regardless of race combination\n | \\*see Pardo\n | 29.2%\n | \\*see Pardo\n | **39.98%** |\n\n\n#### Indigenous people[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Indigenous peoples of South America and Indigenous peoples in South America\n\nIn many places indigenous people still practice a traditional lifestyle based on subsistence agriculture or as hunter-gatherers.

The second largest country is Colombia with a population of 51,516,562. Argentina is the third most populous country with 45,276,780.\n\n\nWhile Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. The largest cities in South America, by far, are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima, and Bogotá. These cities are the only cities on the continent whose metropolitan areas' population exceed eight million. Next in size are Caracas, Belo Horizonte, and Medellin.\n\n\nFive of the top ten metropolitan areas are in Brazil. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the São Paulo metropolitan area, Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, and Belo Horizonte metropolitan area. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the Buenos Aires metropolitan region is above 13 million inhabitants.\n\n\nSouth America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and Greater Porto Alegre. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.\n\n\nThe top ten largest South American metropolitan areas by population as of 2015, based on national census numbers from each country:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Metro Area\n | Population\n | Area\n | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| São Paulo | 21,090,792\n | 7,947 km2 (3,068 sq mi)\n | Brazil\n |\n| Buenos Aires | 13,693,657\n | 3,830 km2 (1,480 sq mi)\n | Argentina\n |\n| Rio de Janeiro | 13,131,431\n | 6,744 km2 (2,604 sq mi)\n | Brazil\n |\n| Lima | 9,904,727\n | 2,819 km2 (1,088 sq mi)\n | Peru\n |\n| Bogotá | 9,800,225\n | 4,200 km2 (1,600 sq mi)\n | Colombia\n |\n| Santiago | 6,683,852\n | 15,403 km2 (5,947 sq mi)\n | Chile\n |\n| Belo Horizonte | 5,829,923\n | 9,467 km2 (3,655 sq mi)\n | Brazil\n |\n| Caracas | 5,322,310\n | 4,715 km2 (1,820 sq mi)\n | Venezuela\n |\n| Porto Alegre | 4,258,926\n | 10,232 km2 (3,951 sq mi)\n | Brazil\n |\n| Brasilia | 4,201,737\n | 56,433 km2 (21,789 sq mi)\n | Brazil\n |\n\n\n2015 Census figures.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of South America, List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal), and List of South American countries by GDP (PPP)\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Most agricultural and livestock products are destined for the domestic market and local consumption. However, the export of agricultural products is essential for the balance of trade in most countries.[101]\n\n\nThe main agrarian crops are export crops, such as soy and wheat. The production of staple foods such as vegetables, corn or beans is large, but focused on domestic consumption. Livestock raising for meat exports is important in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. In tropical regions the most important crops are coffee, cocoa and bananas, mainly in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. Traditionally, the countries producing sugar for export are Peru, Guyana and Suriname, and in Brazil, sugar cane is also used to make ethanol. On the coast of Peru, northeast and south of Brazil, cotton is grown. 50.5% of the South America's land surface is covered by forest,[102] but timber industries are small and directed to domestic markets. In recent years, however, transnational companies have been settling in the Amazon to exploit noble timber destined for export. The Pacific coastal waters of South America are the most important for commercial fishing. The anchovy catch reaches thousands of tonnes, and tuna is also abundant (Peru is a major exporter). The capture of crustaceans is remarkable, particularly in northeastern Brazil and Chile.[101]\n\n\nOnly Brazil and Argentina are part of the G20 (industrial countries), while only Brazil is part of the G8+5 (the most powerful and influential nations in the world). In the tourism sector, a series of negotiations began in 2005 to promote tourism and increase air connections within the region. Punta del Este, Florianópolis and Mar del Plata are among the most important resorts in South America.[101]\n\n\nThe most industrialized countries in South America are Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay respectively. These countries alone account for more than 75 percent of the region's economy and add up to a GDP of more than US$3.0 trillion. Industries in South America began to take on the economies of the region from the 1930s when the Great Depression in the United States and other countries of the world boosted industrial production in the continent. From that period the region left the agricultural side behind and began to achieve high rates of economic growth that remained until the early 1990s when they slowed due to political instabilities, economic crises and neoliberal policies.[101]\n\n\nSince the end of the economic crisis in Brazil and Argentina that occurred in the period from 1998 to 2002, which has led to economic recession, rising unemployment and falling population income, the industrial and service sectors have been recovering rapidly. Chile, Argentina and Brazil have recovered fastest, growing at an average of 5% per year. All of South America after this period has been recovering and showing good signs of economic stability, with controlled inflation and exchange rates, continuous growth, a decrease in social inequality and unemployment – factors that favor industry.[101]\n\n\nThe main industries are: electronics, textiles, food, automotive, metallurgy, aviation, naval, clothing, beverage, steel, tobacco, timber, chemical, among others. Exports reach almost US$400 billion annually, with Brazil accounting for half of this.[101]\n\n\nThe economic gap between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than on most other continents. The richest 10% receive over 40% of the nation's income in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay,[103] while the poorest 20% receive 4% or less in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia.[104] This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie in the vicinity of skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments; nearly one in nine South Americans live on less than $2 per day (on a purchasing power parity basis).[105]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country | GDP (nominal)  in 2017 (in millions of dollars)[106] | GDP (PPP)  in 2017 (in millions of dollars)[106] | GDP (PPP)  per capita  in 2017[106] | Merchandise  exports($bn), 2011[100] | HDI  in 2017  (rank)[107] | Percent with  less than  $2 (PPP)per person  per day[*citation needed*] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Argentina\n | 628,935 | 912,816 | 20,707 | 83.7 | 0.825 | 2.6 |\n| Bolivia\n | 39,267 | 83,608 | 7,552 | 9.1 | 0.693 | 24.9 |\n| Brazil\n | 2,140,940 | 3,216,031 | 15,485 | 250.8 | 0.759 | 10.8 |\n| Chile\n | 251,220 | 455,941 | 24,796 | 86.1 | 0.845 | 2.7 |\n| Colombia\n | 306,439 | 720,151 | 14,609 | 56.5 | 0.747 | 15.8 |\n| Ecuador\n | 97,362 | 184,629 | 11,004 | 22.3 | 0.752 | 10.6 |\n| Falkland Islands[108] (UK)\n | 206.4 | 206.4 | 70,800 | 0.26 |  |  |\n| French Guiana[109] (France)\n | 4,456 | 4,456 | 19,728 | 1.3 |  |  |\n| Guyana\n | 3,591 | 6,398 | 8,306 | 0.9 | 0.654 | 18.0 |\n| Paraguay\n | 28,743 | 68,005 | 9,779 | 9.8 | 0.702 | 13.2 |\n| Peru\n | 207,072 | 429,711 | 13,501 | 46.3 | 0.750 | 12.7 |\n| Suriname\n | 3,641 | 7,961 | 13,934 | 1.6 | 0.720 | 27.2 |\n| Uruguay\n | 58,123 | 77,800 | 22,271 | 8.0 | 0.804 | 2.2 |\n| Venezuela\n | 251,589 | 404,109 | 12,856 | 92.6 | 0.761 | 12.9 |\n| Total | 3,836,569 | 6,642,623 | 17,852 | 669.1 | 0.772 | 11.3 |\n\n\n### Economically largest cities as of 2014[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | City\n | Country\n | GDP in Int$ bn[110] | Population (mil)[110] | GDP per capita\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | São Paulo | Brazil\n | $430\n | 20,847,500\n | $20,650\n |\n| 2\n | Buenos Aires | Argentina\n | $315\n | 13,381,800\n | $23,606\n |\n| 3\n | Lima | Peru\n | $176\n | 10,674,100\n | $16,530\n |\n| 4\n | Rio de Janeiro | Brazil\n | $176\n | 12,460,200\n | $14,176\n |\n| 5\n | Santiago | Chile\n | $171\n | 7,164,400\n | $32,929\n |\n| 6\n | Bogotá | Colombia\n | $160\n | 9,135,800\n | $17,497\n |\n| 7\n | Brasília | Brazil\n | $141\n | 3,976,500\n | $35,689\n |\n| 8\n | Belo Horizonte | Brazil\n | $84\n | 5,595,800\n | $15,134\n |\n| 9\n | Porto Alegre | Brazil\n | $62\n | 4,120,900\n | $15,078\n |\n| 10\n | Campinas | Brazil\n | $59\n | 2,854,200\n | $20,759\n |\n\n\nThe four countries with the strongest agriculture are Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia.

According to the 2019 list, Brazil has the thirteenth most valuable industry in the world (US$173.6 billion), Venezuela the thirtieth largest (US$58.2 billion, however, it depends on oil to obtain this value), Argentina the 31st largest (US$57.7 billion), Colombia the 46th largest (US$35.4 billion), Peru the 50th largest (US$28.7 billion) and Chile the 51st largest (US$28.3 billion).[119]\n\n\nBrazil has the third-largest manufacturing sector in the Americas. Accounting for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil's industries range from automobiles, steel, and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft (Embraer), food, pharmaceutical, footwear, metallurgy and consumer durables. In the food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world.[120][121][122] In 2016, the country was the 2nd largest producer of pulp in the world and the 8th producer of paper.[123][124][125] In the footwear industry, in 2019, Brazil ranked 4th among world producers.[126][127][128][129] In 2019, the country was the 8th producer of vehicles and the 9th producer of steel in the world.[130][131][132] In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the 8th in the world.[133][134][135] In textile industry, Brazil, although it was among the five largest world producers in 2013, is very little integrated in world trade.[136]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cerro Rico, Potosi, Bolivia, still a major silver mine\n![](image)Amethyst mine in Ametista do Sul. South America is a major producer of gems such as amethyst, topaz, emerald, aquamarine and tourmaline.\n![](image)Iron mine in Minas Gerais. Brazil is the world's second largest iron ore exporter.\nMining is one of the most important economic sectors in South America, especially for Chile, Peru and Bolivia, whose economies are highly dependent on this sector. The continent has large productions of gold (mainly in Peru, Brazil and Argentina);[137] silver (mainly in Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina);[138] copper (mainly in Chile, Peru and Brazil);[139] iron ore (Brazil, Peru and Chile);[140] zinc (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil);[141] molybdenum (Chile and Peru);[142] lithium (Chile, Argentina and Brazil);[143] lead (Peru and Bolivia);[144] bauxite (Brazil);[145] tin (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil);[146] manganese (Brazil);[147] antimony (Bolivia and Ecuador);[148] nickel (Brazil);[149] niobium (Brazil);[150] rhenium (Chile);[151] iodine (Chile),[152] among others.\n\n\nBrazil stands out in the extraction of iron ore (where it is the second largest producer and exporter in the world – iron ore is usually one of the three export products that generate the greatest value in the country's trade balance), copper, gold, bauxite (one of the five largest producers in the world), manganese (one of the five largest producers in the world), tin (one of the largest producers in the world), niobium (concentrates 98% of reserves known to the world) and nickel. In terms of gemstones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and opal.[153][154][155][156][157][158]\n\n\nChile contributes about a third of the world copper production.[159] In addition to copper, Chile was, in 2019, the world's largest producer of iodine[160] and rhenium,[161] the second largest producer of lithium[162] and molybdenum,[142] the sixth largest producer of silver,[163] the seventh largest producer of salt,[164] the eighth largest producer of potash,[165] the thirteenth producer of sulfur[166] and the thirteenth producer of iron ore[167] in the world.\n\n\nIn 2019, Peru was the 2nd largest world producer of copper[168] and silver,[163] 8th largest world producer of gold,[169] 3rd largest world producer of lead,[144] 2nd largest world producer of zinc,[170] 4th largest world producer of tin,[171] 5th largest world producer of boron[172] and 4th largest world producer of molybdenum.[142]\n\n\nIn 2019, Bolivia was the 8th largest world producer of silver;[163] 4th largest world producer of boron;[172] 5th largest world producer of antimony;[173] 5th largest world producer of tin;[171] 6th largest world producer of tungsten;[174] 7th largest producer of zinc,[175] and the 8th largest producer of lead.[144][176][177]\n\n\nIn 2019, Argentina was the 4th largest world producer of lithium,[162] the 9th largest world producer of silver,[163] the 17th largest world producer of gold[169] and the 7th largest world producer of boron.[172]\n\n\nColombia is the world's largest producer of emeralds.[178] In the production of gold, among 2006 and 2017, the country produced 15 tons per year until 2007, when its production increased significantly, breaking a record of 66.1 tons extracted in 2012. In 2017, it extracted 52.2 tons. The country is among the 25 largest gold producers in the world.[179] In the production of silver, in 2017 the country extracted 15,5 tons.[176][177][180]\n\n\nIn the production of oil, Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Venezuela was the 21st largest, with 877 thousand barrels / day, Colombia in 22nd with 886 thousand barrels / day, Ecuador in 28th with 531 thousand barrels / day and Argentina 29th with 507 thousand barrels / day. As Venezuela and Ecuador consume little oil and export most of their production, they are part of OPEC. Venezuela had a big drop in production after 2015 (where it produced 2.5 million barrels / day), falling in 2016 to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, due to lack of investments.[181]\n\n\nIn the production of natural gas, in 2018, Argentina produced 1524 bcf (billion cubic feet), Venezuela 946, Brazil 877, Bolivia 617, Peru 451, Colombia 379.[182]\n\n\nIn the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, Brazil exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January 2021, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.[183]\n\n\nIn the production of coal, the continent had 2 of the 30 largest world producers in 2018: Colombia (12th) and Brazil (27th).[184]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Grape plantation in Argentina.

Some of the most visited places in the region are Rio de Janeiro, Florianópolis, Iguazu Falls, São Paulo, Armação dos Búzios, Salvador, Bombinhas, Angra dos Reis, Balneário Camboriú, Paraty, Ipojuca, Natal, Cairu, Fortaleza and Itapema in Brazil;[187] Buenos Aires, Bariloche, Salta, Jujuy, Perito Moreno Glacier, Valdes Peninsula, Guarani Jesuit Missions in the cities of Misiones and Corrientes, Ischigualasto Provincial Park, Ushuaia and Patagonia in Argentina;[188]\nIsla Margarita, Angel Falls, Los Roques archipelago, Gran Sabana in Venezuela; Machu Picchu, Lima, Nazca Lines, Cuzco in Peru; Lake Titicaca, Salar de Uyuni, La Paz, Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos in Bolivia; Tayrona National Natural Park, Santa Marta, Bogotá, Cali, Medellín, Cartagena in Colombia, and the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.[189][190] In 2016 Brazil hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Cartagena (2008), a major port on the northern coast of Colombia and one of the country's main tourist destinations\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTeatro Solis, Uruguay\n![](image)\nNational Library, Brazil\n![](image)\nArya Diwaker Hindu temple, Paramaribo, Suriname\n\nSouth Americans are culturally influenced by their indigenous peoples, the historic connection with the Iberian Peninsula and Africa, and waves of immigrants from around the globe.\n\n\nSouth American nations have a rich variety of music. Some of the most famous genres include vallenato and cumbia from Colombia, pasillo from Colombia and Ecuador, samba, bossa nova and música sertaneja from Brazil, joropo from Venezuela and tango from Argentina and Uruguay. Also well known is the non-commercial folk genre Nueva Canción movement which was founded in Argentina and Chile and quickly spread to the rest of the Latin America.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nTango show in Buenos Aires, typical Argentine dance\n![](image)\nCarmen Miranda, Portuguese Brazilian singer helped popularize samba internationally.\n\nPeople on the Peruvian coast created the fine guitar and cajon duos or trios in the most mestizo (mixed) of South American rhythms such as the Marinera (from Lima), the Tondero (from Piura), the 19th-century popular Creole Valse or Peruvian Valse, the soulful Arequipan Yaravi, and the early-20th-century Paraguayan Guarania. In the late 20th century, Spanish rock emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. Brazil has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres. In the central and western regions of Bolivia, Andean and folklore music like Diablada, Caporales and Morenada are the most representative of the country, which were originated by European, Aymara and Quechua influences.\n\n\nThe literature of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel García Márquez in novels and Jorge Luis Borges and Pablo Neruda in other genres. The Brazilians Machado de Assis and João Guimarães Rosa are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writers.\n\n\n\n### Food and drink[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of South America\n\nBecause of South America's broad ethnic mix, South American cuisine has African, Mestizo, South Asian, East Asian, and European influences. Bahia, Brazil, is especially well known for its West African–influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. People in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Chile, Bolivia and Southern Brazil drink mate, an herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, terere, differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. Pisco is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, African, Arab, Andean, and Amazonic food.\n\n\n\n### Plastic arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Art of South America\n\n![](image)*Bird* (UOB Plaza, Singapore), sculpture of Colombian artist Fernando Botero\n![](image)\"Chromovegetal Maze\" by Carlos Cruz Diez, in Caracas\nThe artist Oswaldo Guayasamín (1919–1999) from Ecuador, represented with his painting style the feeling of the peoples of Latin America[191] highlighting social injustices in various parts of the world. The Colombian Fernando Botero (1932–2023) was one of the greatest exponents of painting and sculpture was able to develop a recognizable style of his own.[192] For his part, the Venezuelan Carlos Cruz-Diez has contributed significantly to contemporary art,[193] with the presence of works around the world.\n\n\nCurrently several emerging South American artists are recognized by international art critics: Guillermo Lorca – Chilean painter,[194][195] Teddy Cobeña – Ecuadorian sculptor and recipient of international sculpture award in France)[196][197][198] and Argentine artist Adrián Villar Rojas[199][200] – winner of the Zurich Museum Art Award among many others.\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in South America\n\n![](image)Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, BrazilA wide range of sports are played in the continent of South America, with football being the most popular overall, while baseball is the most popular in Venezuela.\n\n\nOther sports include basketball, cycling, polo, volleyball, futsal, motorsports, rugby (mostly in Argentina and Uruguay), handball, tennis, golf, field hockey, boxing, and cricket.\n\n\nSouth America hosted its first Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016, and has hosted the Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2018.\n\n\nSouth America shares with Europe supremacy over the sport of football as all winners in FIFA World Cup history and all winning teams in the FIFA Club World Cup have come from these two continents. Brazil holds the record for most times winning the FIFA World Cup with five titles.[201] Argentina has three titles and Uruguay two. So far five South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). Two were from Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978).\n\n\nSouth America is home to the longest-running international football tournament, the Copa América, which has been contested since 1916. Argentina and Uruguay have won the Copa América 15 times each, the most among all countries.\n\n\nAlso, in South America, a multi-sport event, the South American Games, are held every four years. The first edition was held in La Paz in 1978 and the most recent took place in Santiago in 2014.\n\n\nSouth American Cricket Championship is an international one-day cricket tournament played since 1995 featuring national teams from South America and certain other invited sides including teams from North America, currently played annually but until 2013 was usually played every two seasons.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wind farm in the Paraguaná Peninsula, Venezuela\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nDue to the diversity of topography and pluviometric precipitation conditions, the region's water resources vary enormously in different areas. In the Andes, navigation possibilities are limited, except for the Magdalena River, Lake Titicaca and the lakes of the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. Irrigation is an important factor for agriculture from northwestern Peru to Patagonia. Less than 10% of the known electrical potential of the Andes had been used until the mid-1960s.\n\n\nThe Brazilian Highlands have a much higher hydroelectric potential than the Andean region[*citation needed*] and its possibilities of exploitation are greater due to the existence of several large rivers with high margins and the occurrence of great differences forming huge cataracts, such as those of Paulo Afonso, Iguaçu and others. The Amazon River system has about 13,000 km of waterways, but its possibilities for hydroelectric use are still unknown.\n\n\nMost of the continent's energy is generated through hydroelectric power plants, but there is also an important share of thermoelectric and wind energy. Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries that generate nuclear power, each with two nuclear power plants. In 1991 these countries signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Itaipu Dam, the second largest of the world in energy production\n\n![](image)Wind power in Parnaíba\n![](image)Angra Nuclear Power Plant in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro\n![](image)Pirapora Solar Complex, the largest in Brazil and Latin America with a capacity of 321 MW\nThe Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Production manages to supply the country's demand.[181] In the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, the country exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January this year, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.[183]\n\n\nBrazil is one of the main world producers of hydroelectric power. In 2019, Brazil had 217 hydroelectric plants in operation, with an installed capacity of 98,581 MW, 60.16% of the country's energy generation.[202] In the total generation of electricity, in 2019 Brazil reached 170,000 megawatts of installed capacity, more than 75% from renewable sources (the majority, hydroelectric).[203][204]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Southeast Region used about 50% of the load of the National Integrated System (SIN), being the main energy consuming region in the country. The region's installed electricity generation capacity totaled almost 42,500 MW, which represented about a third of Brazil's generation capacity. The hydroelectric generation represented 58% of the region's installed capacity, with the remaining 42% corresponding basically to the thermoelectric generation. São Paulo accounted for 40% of this capacity; Minas Gerais by about 25%; Rio de Janeiro by 13.3%; and Espírito Santo accounted for the rest. The South Region owns the Itaipu Dam, which was the largest hydroelectric plant in the world for several years, until the inauguration of Three Gorges Dam in China. It remains the second largest operating hydroelectric in the world. Brazil is the co-owner of the Itaipu Plant with Paraguay: the dam is located on the Paraná River, located on the border between countries. It has an installed generation capacity of 14 GW for 20 generating units of 700 MW each. North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and Tucuruí Dam, which produce much of the national energy. Brazil's hydroelectric potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory.[205][206]\n\n\nAs of July 2022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power was 22 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%.[207][208] While the world average wind production capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil, specially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity factors over 60%;[209][210] the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45% in the coast and 49% in the interior.[211] In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of the energy generated in the country.[212] In 2019, it was estimated that the country had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW (this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country's current demand.[213][214] In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21 GW),[215][216] and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, United States and Germany.[217][218]\n\n\nNuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity.[219] The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear S/A), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás. Nuclear energy is produced by two reactors at Angra. It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro. It consists of two pressurized water reactors, Angra I, with capacity of 657 MW, connected to the power grid in 1982, and Angra II, with capacity of 1,350 MW, connected in 2000. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of 1,350 MW, is planned to be finished.[220]\n\n\nAs of October 2022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of photovoltaic solar was 21 GW, with average capacity factor of 23%.[221] Some of the most irradiated Brazilian States are MG (\"Minas Gerais\"), BA (\"Bahia\") and GO (Goiás), which have indeed world irradiation level records.[222][210][223] In 2019, solar power represented 1.27% of the energy generated in the country.[212] In 2021, Brazil was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13 GW),[224] and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).[225]\n\n\nIn 2020, Brazil was the 2nd largest country in the world in the production of energy through biomass (energy production from solid biofuels and renewable waste), with 15,2 GW installed.[226]\n\n\nAfter Brazil, Colombia is the country in South America that most stands out in energy production. In 2020, the country was the 20th largest petroleum producer in the world, and in 2015 it was the 19th largest exporter. In natural gas, the country was, in 2015, the 40th largest producer in the world. Colombia's biggest highlight is in coal, where the country was, in 2018, the world's 12th largest producer and the 5th largest exporter. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 45th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (0.5 GW), 76th in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.1 GW) and 20th in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (12.6 GW). Venezuela, which was one of the world's largest oil producers (about 2.5 million barrels/day in 2015) and one of the largest exporters, due to its political problems, has had its production drastically reduced in recent years: in 2016, it dropped to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, reaching only 300,000 barrels/day at a given point. The country also stands out in hydroelectricity, where it was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed capacity in 2020 (16,5 GW). Argentina was, in 2017, the 18th largest producer in the world, and the largest producer in Latin America, of natural gas, in addition to being the 28th largest oil producer; although the country has the Vaca Muerta field, which holds close to 16 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil, and is the second largest shale natural gas deposit in the world, the country lacks the capacity to exploit the deposit: it is necessary capital, technology and knowledge that can only come from offshore energy companies, who view Argentina and its erratic economic policies with considerable suspicion, not wanting to invest in the country. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 27th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (2.6 GW), 42nd in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.7 GW) and 21st in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW). The country has great future potential for the production of wind energy in the Patagonia region. Chile, although currently not a major energy producer, has great future potential for solar energy production in the Atacama Desert region. Paraguay stands out today in hydroelectric production thanks to the Itaipu Power Plant. Bolivia stand out in the production of natural gas, where it was the 31st largest in the world in 2015. Ecuador, because it consumes little energy, is part of OPEC and was the 27th largest oil producer in the world in 2020, being the 22nd largest exporter in 2014.[227][228][229][218]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nTransport in South America is basically carried out using various modes including: roads, seaports and airports. The railway and fluvial sector, although having more robust contemporary potential, are still somewhat treated in a secondary way.\n\n\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\nDue to the Andes Mountains, Amazon River and Amazon Forest, there have always been difficulties in implementing largerscale transcontinental or bioceanic highways. Practically the only route that existed was the one that connected Brazil to Buenos Aires, (in Argentina) and later to Santiago, (in Chile). However, in recent years, with the combined effort of countries, new routes have started to emerge, such as Brazil-Peru (Interoceanic Highway), and a new highway between Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile (Bioceanic Corridor).\n\n\nSome of the most modern roads extend through northern and south-east Argentina; and south of Brazil, a vast road complex aims to link Brasília, the federal capital, to the South, Southeast, Northeast and Northern regions of Brazil.\n\n\nBrazil has more than 1.7 million km of roads, of which 215,000 km are paved, and about 14,000 km are divided highways. The two most important highways in the country are BR-101 and BR-116.[230] Argentina has more than 600,000 km of roads, of which about 70,000 km are paved, and about 2,500 km are divided highways. The three most important highways in the country are Route 9, Route 7 and Route 14.[230] Colombia has about 210,000 km of roads, and about 2,300 km are divided highways.[231] Chile has about 82,000 km of roads, 20,000 km of which are paved, and about 2,000 km are divided highways. The most important highway in the country is the Route 5 (Pan-American Highway)[232] These 4 countries are the ones with the best road infrastructure and with the largest number of double-lane highways.\n\n\nIn addition, there is a reputed Pan-American Highway, which crosses Argentina and the Andean countries from north to south, although various stretches are unfinished.[233]\n\n\n\n#### Aviation[edit]\n\n\nIn South America, commercial aviation has a magnificent expansion field, which has one of the largest traffic density lines in the world, Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo, and large airports, such as Congonhas, São Paulo–Guarulhos International and Viracopos (São Paulo), Rio de Janeiro International and Santos Dumont (Rio de Janeiro), El Dorado (Bogotá), Ezeiza (Buenos Aires), Tancredo Neves International Airport (Belo Horizonte), Curitiba International Airport (Curitiba), Brasilia, Caracas, Montevideo, Lima, Viru Viru International Airport (Santa Cruz de la Sierra), Recife, Salvador, Salgado Filho International Airport (Porto Alegre), Fortaleza, Manaus and Belém.\n\n\nThere are more than 2,000 airports in Brazil. The country has the second largest number of airports in the world, behind only the United States. São Paulo International Airport, located in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, is the largest and busiest in the country – the airport connects São Paulo to practically all major cities around the world. Brazil has 44 international airports, such as those in Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Florianópolis, Cuiabá, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza, Belém and Manaus, among others. Argentina has important international airports such as Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Bariloche, Mendoza, Salta, Puerto Iguazú, Neuquén and Usuhaia, among others. Chile has important international airports such as Santiago, Antofagasta, Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas and Iquique, among others. Colombia has important international airports such as Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena, Cali and Barranquilla, among others. Other important airports are those in the capitals of Uruguay (Montevideo), Paraguay (Asunción), Peru (Lima), Bolivia (La Paz) and Ecuador (Quito). The 10 busiest airports in South America in 2017 were: São Paulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia), São Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil), Santiago (Chile), Lima (Peru), Brasília (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires-Aeroparque (Argentina), Buenos Aires-Ezeiza (Argentina), and Minas Gerais (Brazil).[234]\n\n\n\n#### Seaports and harbors[edit]\n\n\nThe two main merchant fleets also belong to Brazil and Argentina. The following are those of Chile, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia. The largest ports in commercial movement are those of Buenos Aires, Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Bahía Blanca, Rosario, Valparaíso, Recife, Salvador, Montevideo, Paranaguá, Rio Grande, Fortaleza, Belém and Maracaibo.\n\n\nAbout ports, Brazil has some of the busiest seaports in South America, such as Port of Santos, Port of Rio de Janeiro, Port of Paranaguá, Port of Itajaí, Port of Rio Grande, Port of São Francisco do Sul and Suape Port. Argentina has ports such as Port of Buenos Aires and Port of Rosario. Chile has important ports in Valparaíso, Caldera, Mejillones, Antofagasta, Iquique, Arica and Puerto Montt. Colombia has important ports such as Buenaventura, Cartagena Container Terminal and Puerto Bolivar. Peru has important ports in Callao, Ilo and Matarani. The 15 busiest ports in South America are: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de Cartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires (Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itajaí (Brazil), Valparaíso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranaguá (Brazil), Rio Grande (Brazil), São Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).[235]\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nTwo primary railroads are continental: the Transandina, which connects Buenos Aires, in Argentina to Valparaíso, in Chile, and the Brazil–Bolivia Railroad, which makes it the connection between the port of Santos in Brazil and the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, in Bolivia.\n\n\nTwo areas of greater density occur in the railway sector: the platinum network, which develops around the Platine region, largely belonging to Argentina, with more than 45,000 km in length; And the Southeast Brazil network, which mainly serves the state of São Paulo, state of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais.\n\n\nThe Argentine rail network, with 47,000 km of tracks, and at one stage was one of the largest in the world and continues to be the most extensive in Latin America. It came to have about 100,000 km of rails, but the lifting of tracks and the emphasis placed on motor transport gradually reduced it. It has four different trails and international connections with Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay. The Brazilian railway network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It's basically used for transporting ores.[236] Chile has almost 7,000 km of railways, with connections to Argentina, Bolivia and Peru. Colombia has about 3,500 km of railways.[237]\n\n\n\n#### Waterways[edit]\n\n\nSouth America has one of the largest bays of navigable inland waterways in the world, represented mainly by the Amazon basin, the Platine basin, the São Francisco and the Orinoco basins, Brazil having about 54,000 km navigable, while Argentina has 6,500 km and Venezuela, 1,200 km.\n\n\nAmong the main Brazilian waterways, two stand out: Hidrovia Tietê-Paraná (which has a length of 2,400 km, 1,600 on the Paraná River and 800 km on the Tietê River, draining agricultural production from the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás and part of Rondônia, Tocantins and Minas Gerais) and Hidrovia do Solimões-Amazonas (it has two sections: Solimões, which extends from Tabatinga to Manaus, with approximately 1600 km, and Amazonas, which extends from Manaus to Belém, with 1650 km. Almost entirely passenger transport from the Amazon plain is done by this waterway, in addition to practically all cargo transportation that is directed to the major regional centers of Belém and Manaus). In Brazil, this transport is still underused: the most important waterway stretches, from an economic point of view, are found in the Southeast and South of the country. Its full use still depends on the construction of locks, major dredging works and, mainly, of ports that allow intermodal integration. In Argentina, the waterway network is made up of the La Plata, Paraná, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers. The main river ports are Zárate and Campana. The port of Buenos Aires is historically the first in individual importance, but the area known as Up-River, which stretches along 67 km of the Santa Fé portion of the Paraná River, brings together 17 ports that concentrate 50% of the total exports of the country.\n\n\n\n#### Public transport[edit]\n\n\nThe main public transport in major cities is the bus. Many cities also have a diverse system of metro and subway trains, the first of which was the Buenos Aires subte, opened 1913.[238] The Santiago subway[239] is the largest network in South America, with 103 km, while the São Paulo subway is the most heavily used, with more than 4.6 million passengers per day[240] and was voted the best in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro installed the first railroad of the continent in 1854. Today the city has a vast and diversified system of metropolitan trains, integrated with buses and subway. Recently it was also inaugurated in the city a Light Rail System called VLT, a small electrical trams at low speed, while São Paulo inaugurated its monorail, the first of South America.[*citation needed*] In Brazil, an express bus system called Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which operates in several cities, has also been developed. Mi Teleférico, also known as Teleférico La Paz–El Alto (La Paz–El Alto Cable Car), is an aerial cable car urban transit system serving the La Paz–El Alto metropolitan area in Bolivia.\n\n\n\n* ![Ruta 9 / 14, in Zarate, Argentina](image)\n\nRuta 9 / 14, in Zarate, Argentina\n* ![Rio–Niterói Bridge](image)\n\nRio–Niterói Bridge\n* ![Rio de Janeiro International Airport](image)\n\nRio de Janeiro International Airport\n* ![Port of Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil](image)\n\nPort of Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil\n* ![](image)\n\nHighway in Argentina\n* ![General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge in Venezuela](image)\n\nGeneral Rafael Urdaneta Bridge in Venezuela\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Port of Callao in Lima\n* ![The La Paz cable car system in Bolivia is home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world.](image)\n\nThe La Paz cable car system in Bolivia is home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)South America portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* Flags of South America\n* List of World Heritage Sites in South America\n* Outline of South America – Hierarchical outline list of articles related to South America\n* South American Games\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Sometimes included.
