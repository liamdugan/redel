It is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery (primarily of Africans) led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. However, racial discrimination and inequality continued into subsequent centuries. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon, notably with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n\n\nThe United States government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been extensively shaped by the world's largest immigrant population.\n\n\nHighly developed, the U.S. has by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by nominal GDP. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter, as well as the largest consumer market. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of the United States and Demonyms for the United States\n\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[28][29][30] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in *The Virginia Gazette* newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[31]\n\n\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[32][33] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of United States history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)Cliff Palace, located in present-day Colorado, was built by Ancestral Puebloans.\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000BC, is believed to represent the first widespread culture in the Americas.[37][38] The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward.[39]\n\n\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in present-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region in present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Algonquian were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. Before European immigrants made contact, most of the Algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the \"Three Sisters\". By the time of European contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands' productivity and manage land.[43][44][45][46][47][48] The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[49] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[50] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants[51][52] range from around 500,000[53][51] to nearly 10 million.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Colonization (1492–1763)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial history of the United States\n\n![](image)British North America in 1775 with the 13 colonies shown in red\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, and Spain soon established Spanish Florida on the mainland.[54][55] \nThe Spanish Empire set up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in Saint Augustine (1565), which is often considered the nation's oldest city,[56] and Santa Fe (1598). The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in the present-day New York Bay region.[57] The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New Orleans (1718) and Mobile (1702).[58]\nBritish colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[59][60] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England seeking religious freedom.[61] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[62][63]\n\n\nDuring 17th-century European colonization, settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, particularly in King Philip's War, but often came to develop a mutual dependency. Settlers traded guns, tools, and European goods for food and animal pelts.[64] Native Americans taught settlers to cultivate local foods. Colonial authorities often pursued policies to to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urge or force them to adopt European lifestyles.[65][66] The native population of America declined after European arrival,[67][68][69] primarily as a result of infectious diseases brought from Europe such as smallpox and measles,[70][71] and native peoples were displaced by European expansion.[72]\n\n\nEuropean settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.[73] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the Southern Colonies.[74] Southern tobacco colonies passed laws designed to keep African Americans subservient.[75][76][77]\n\n\nThe original Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered by Great Britain.[78] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some areas, Catholics.[79][80] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[81] By the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[82] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance, [83] and the First Great Awakening—a series of Christian revivals—fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[84]\n\n\n\n### Revolution and the new nation (1763–1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1776–1789)\n\nFurther information: American Enlightenment\n\n![See caption](image)*Declaration of Independence*, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia\nAfter the British victory in the French and Indian War, won largely through the support from the colonies, the British began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. In 1774, to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the British government that extracted taxes from them, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The British attempted to disarm the Americans, resulting in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and charged a committee led by Thomas Jefferson with writing a Declaration of Independence.[85]\n\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.[86] After the surrender of a second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day Canada in the north to Florida in the south.[87] Washington resigned his commission, returned to private life, and the Continental Army was disbanded. \n\n\n\n![](image)*The Old Plantation*, a c. 1790 painting of a plantation by a South Carolina slaveholder\nRatified by the states in 1781 and based on the concept of \"consent of the governed\", the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[86] Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,[88] the Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states.[89] The prohibition of slavery in the Northwest Territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as an extension of the Mason–Dixon line, the geographic and political divide between slave states and free states.[90][91]\n\n\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was drafted. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[92] Ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789, reorganizing the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington was elected the nation's first President under the new constitution and returned to public life. The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by sceptics of the more centralized national government.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### Expansion (1789–1860)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1789–1849)\n ![](image)Animated map of the territorial evolution of the United States (click to view full size image)\nDuring the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies. However, during the American Revolution, many began to question the practice.[95] Founding Fathers in the northern United States advocated for the abolition of slavery, and slavery was abolished in Northern states.[96] The increased profitability for southern elites after the cotton gin lowered production costs entrenched support for slavery in the southern United States.[97][98][99]\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, with a sense of manifest destiny.[100] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) nearly doubled the territory of the United States, and effectively ended French opposition to America's westward expansion.[101] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a virtual draw but established the United States as capable of defending itself.[102] Spain ceded Florida and their Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[103] The Missouri Compromise (1820) admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, dividing the country into free states, which forbade slavery, and slave states, which protected the institution.[104] [105]\n\n\nAs Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[106][107] The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River.[108][109] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[105] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[110] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, resulting in the U.S. stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.[100][111]\n\n\n\n### Civil War and Reconstruction (1860–1876)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1849–1865) and 1865–1918\n\n![](image)Division of the states during the American Civil War\n * Union states\n* Border states\n* Confederate states\n* Territories\nSectional conflict regarding slavery[112] culminated in the American Civil War.[113] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states (the Union) maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[114] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston, South Carolina. The ensuing Civil War (1861–1865) became the deadliest military conflict in American history.[115] In 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor following the Siege of Vicksburg led by General Ulysses S. Grant, which gave them control of the Mississippi River, and the Battle of Gettysburg, where the Union Army halted Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered.[116]\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Chinese railroad workers on the Central Pacific Railroad, 1870\nThe Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Radical Republicans passed the Reconstruction Amendments to ensure the rights of African Americans. The biracial Southern governments were opposed by terrorist and paramilitary organizations. To encourage additional westward settlement the Homestead Acts allowed an applicant to acquire ownership of government land, by residing there. More than 160 million acres (650 thousand km2; 250 thousand sq mi)—nearly 10 percent of the total area of the United States—were given away free to 1.6 million homesteaders. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 was enacted to break a cycle of debt during Reconstruction. This act attempted to sell land at low prices so marginalized Southerners could buy it, but many were still too poor to afford the lower prices.[117] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred growth in the American Old West. New transcontinental railways made relocation easier, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[118]\n\n\n\n### Development of the modern United States (1876–1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1865–1918)\n\n![](image)An October 24th, 1874 Harper's Magazine editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast denouncing Ku Klux Klan and White League murders of African Americans\nThe Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[119][120] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[121] From 1890 to 1910, the Southern States established Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all African Americans. Racial segregation was prevalent nationwide and discrimination was codified, especially in the South,[122] while well into the 20th century lynching and other forms of unjustified vigilante violence often went unprosecuted.[123][124]\n\n\nTerritorial expansion continued apace. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[125] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish–American War.[126] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but through the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917,[127] allowing for the conscription of 20,000 Puerto Ricans, which began two months later.[128] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[129] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[130]\n\n\n\nAn Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[131][132]\nFrom 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe including Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Russia, and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.[133] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892 specifically through the now iconic Ellis Island. New York and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[134] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[135]\n\n\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[136] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[137] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[138][139][140] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[141]\n\n\n\n### World Wars period (1914–1945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1918–1945)\n\n![](image)The Trinity nuclear test in the Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945, part of the Manhattan Project and the first detonation of a nuclear weapon\nThe early 20th century was a time of industrial expansion and social change in the United States.[142][143] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[144] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[145] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the United States.[146] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[147][148]\n\n\nAt first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[149][150] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them again the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[151][152] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[153][154] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.[155]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary United States (1945–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), 1964–1980, 1980–1991, and 1991–2008\n\n![See caption](image)Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.\nAfter World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate the affairs of other countries.[156] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[157][158][159][160][161] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[162]\n\n\nThe civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[163] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable for recreational drug use, sexuality[164][165] and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in Vietnam.[166] The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, which led to a decline in public trust in government.[167]\n\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s saw economic stagflation and President Ronald Reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[168][169][170][171] By 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[172] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[173][174][175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Twin Towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks, 2001\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, the U.S. faced challenges from terrorism, with the September 11 attacks in 2001 leading to the war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[177][178] The U.S. housing bubble in 2006 culminated in the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[179] Amid the financial crisis, Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, was elected in 2008.[180][181]\n\n\nPolitical polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated political discussion.[182] The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 100 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths,[183] making it the most deadly pandemic in U.S. history.[184] Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election culminated in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power.[185]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the United States\n\n![](image)A topographic map of the United States\nThe United States is the world's third-largest nation by land and total area behind Russia and Canada.[c][186][187] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2).[188][189] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[190]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[191] The Mississippi River System—the world's fourth longest river system—runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[191]\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[192] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[193] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[194] about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[195] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[196] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[197]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Köppen climate types of the United States\nMain articles: Climate of the United States and Climate change in the United States\n\nWith its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[198] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[199]\n\n\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[200] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[201] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[202]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States\n\n![A bald eagle](image)The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States since 1782[203]\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[204] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[205] and 91,000 insect species.[206]\n\n\nThere are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[207] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[208] primarily in the western states.[209] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for industrial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[210][211]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biological diversity, logging and deforestation,[212][213] and climate change.[214][215] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[216] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[217] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[218] As of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[219] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[220]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Constitution of the United States, Politics of the United States, and Government of the United States\n\nFurther information: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, Political ideologies in the United States, American patriotism, and American civil religion\n\n![](image)The Capitol and its two legislative chambers, the Senate (left) and the House of Representatives (right)\n![](image)The White House, the residence and workplace of the U.S. President and the offices of the presidential staff\n![](image)The Supreme Court Building, which houses the nation's highest court\nThe United States was founded on the principles of the American Enlightenment. It is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[221][222] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and, according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[223] It is a liberal representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\"[224] The U.S. Constitution serves as the country's supreme legal document, establishing the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states.[225]\n\n\nThe federal government comprises three branches, which are headquartered in Washington, D.C. and regulated by a system of checks and balances.[226]\n\n\n\n* The U.S. Congress, a bicameral legislature, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[227] and has the power of impeachment.[228] The Senate has 100 members (2 from each state), elected for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members from single member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of population, elected for a two-year term.\n* The U.S. President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies through their respective agencies.[229] The president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election.[230] It is an indirect election, with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the Electoral College. The President and Vice President serve a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice.\n* The U.S. federal judiciary, whose judges are all appointed for life by the President with Senate approval, consists primarily of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[231] The Supreme Court is led by the chief justice of the United States. It has nine members who serve for life. The members are appointed by the sitting president when a vacancy becomes available.[232]\n\n\n### Political subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Political divisions of the United States, State government in the United States, Local government in the United States, and U.S. state\n\nFurther information: List of states and territories of the United States, Indian reservation, and Territories of the United States\n\nSee also: Territorial evolution of the United States\n\nIn the American federal system, sovereignty is shared between two levels of government: federal and state. Each of the 50 states has territory where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[233] The territories and the District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government.[234]\n\n![](image)\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States\n\n![see caption](image)The United Nations headquarters has been situated along the East River in Midtown Manhattan since 1952; in 1945, the United States was a founding member of the UN.\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019.[235] It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[236] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[237] The United States is a member of the G7,[238] G20,[239] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[240] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[241] North Korea,[242] and Bhutan.[243] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[244] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[245]\n\n\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[246] and strong ties with Canada,[247] Australia,[248] New Zealand,[249] the Philippines,[250] Japan,[251] South Korea,[252] Israel,[253] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[254] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[255] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[256] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[257] and its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[258][259] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine.[260][261]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Armed Forces and Military history of the United States\n\n![](image)The Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[366]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to the United States\n\nAmerica's immigrant population, numbering more than 50 million, is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[367][368] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[369] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[370] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[371] The United States has led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[372]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligious affiliation in USA, per Gallup, Inc. (2022)[373]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (34%)\nCatholicism (23%)\nNon-specific Christian (11%)\nMormonism (2%)\nJudaism (2%)\nOther religions (6%)\nUnaffiliated (21%)\nNo answer (1%)\n\nMain articles: Religion in the United States and Irreligion in the United States\n\nSee also: List of religious movements that began in the United States\n\nThe First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.[374][375] Religious practice is widespread, among the most diverse in the world,[376] and vibrant, with the country being far more religious than other wealthy Western nations.[377] An overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power,[378] engage in spiritual practices such as prayer,[379] and consider themselves religious or spiritual.[380][381] The country has the world's largest Christian population.[382] A majority of the global Jewish population lives in the United States, as measured by the Law of Return.[383]\n\n\nA 2022 *Gallup* poll found that 31% reported \"attending a church, synagogue, mosque or temple weekly or nearly weekly\".[384] Religious practice varies significantly by region.[385] In the \"Bible Belt\", located within the Southern United States, evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally. New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious,[385] although Mormonism—a Restorationist Christian movement started in New York in the 19th century—is the predominant religious affiliation in Utah.[386]\n\n\nAround 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith.[387] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.[388] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[389] Religious belief and interest has remained relatively stable in recent years; organizational participation, in contrast, has decreased.[390] Other notable faiths include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, many New Age movements, and a large variety of Native American religions.[391]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population\n\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[186] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[392] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[393] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[394]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in the United States2023 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[395]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |  |\n| ![New York](image)New York![Los Angeles](image)Los Angeles | 1 | New York | Northeast | 19,498,249 | 11 | Boston | Northeast | 4,919,179\n | ![Chicago](image)Chicago![Dallas–Fort Worth](image)Dallas–Fort Worth |\n| 2 | Los Angeles | West | 12,799,100 | 12 | Riverside–San Bernardino | West | 4,688,053\n |\n| 3 | Chicago | Midwest | 9,262,825 | 13 | San Francisco | West | 4,566,961\n |\n| 4 | Dallas–Fort Worth | South | 8,100,037 | 14 | Detroit | Midwest | 4,342,304\n |\n| 5 | Houston | South | 7,510,253 | 15 | Seattle | West | 4,044,837\n |\n| 6 | Atlanta | South | 6,307,261 | 16 | Minneapolis–Saint Paul | Midwest | 3,712,020\n |\n| 7 | Washington, D.C. | South | 6,304,975 | 17 | Tampa–St. Petersburg | South | 3,342,963\n |\n| 8 | Philadelphia | Northeast | 6,246,160 | 18 | San Diego | West | 3,269,973\n |\n| 9 | Miami | South | 6,183,199 | 19 | Denver | West | 3,005,131\n |\n| 10 | Phoenix | West | 5,070,110 | 20 | Baltimore | South | 2,834,316\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Healthcare in the United States, Healthcare reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\n\n![The Texas Medical Center, a cluster of contemporary skyscrapers, at night](image)Texas Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, employing 106,000 people and treating 10 million patients annually as of 2016.[396]\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. The chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[397][398] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Black and American Indian–Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[399][400] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[401] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[402] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[403] Poverty is the 4th leading risk factor for premature death in the United States annually, according to a 2023 study published in *JAMA*.[404][405]\n\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations.[406] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[407]\n\n\nGovernment-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[o][408] with the law roughly halving the uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[409] Its legacy remains controversial.[410]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States\n\n![Photograph of the University of Virginia](image)The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of many public colleges and universities in the United States.\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[411] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[412] The basic literacy rate is near-universal.[186][413] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).[414][415]\n\n\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education including many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[416][417][418] There are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[419] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[420] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[421]\n\n\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[422] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[423] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[424] and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of 2022.[425]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of the United States and Society of the United States\n\n![The Statue of Liberty, a large teal bronze sculpture on a stone pedestal](image)The Statue of Liberty (*Liberty Enlightening the World*) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream.[426]\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[427][428] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[429][430] having a strong work ethic,[431] competitiveness,[432] and voluntary altruism towards others.[433][434][435] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.[436] Part of both the Anglosphere and Western World, the United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[437][438] and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale,[439][440] with the phenomenon being termed *Americanization*.[441] As such, the U.S. is considered a cultural superpower.[442]\n\n\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[443] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[437][444] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[437] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[445] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[446][447][448][449] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[450] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[451] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[452]\n\n\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[453] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[454][455][456] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[457] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[458] It is a socially progressive country[459] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[460] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world.[460][461][462]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American literature and American philosophy\n\n![Photograph of Mark Twain](image)Mark Twain, who William Faulkner called \"the father of American literature\"[463]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[464]\n\n\nAlmost until the 20th century pervasive anti-literacy laws prevented most people of color from learning to read or write.[465][466] In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated from the Southern United States and West Indies. Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the *négritude* philosophy.[467]\n\n\nSince its first use in the 19th century, the term \"Great American Novel\" has been applied to many books, including Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852), Twain's *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* (1925), John Steinbeck's *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939), Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1960), Toni Morrison's *Beloved* (1987), and David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* (1996).[468][469][470]\n\n\nThirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise Glück, Bob Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[471] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck have been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[472]\n\n\n\n### Mass media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mass media in the United States\n\nSee also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, Radio in the United States, and Video games in the United States\n\n![](image)Comcast Center in Philadelphia, headquarters of Comcast, the world's largest telecommunications and media conglomerate\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[473] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[474] As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[475] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[476]\n\n\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *USA Today*.[477] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[478][479] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as *The Village Voice* in New York City and *LA Weekly* in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[480]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the video game market of the United States is the world's largest by revenue.[481] Major video game publishers and developers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[482][483] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[484]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theater in the United States\n\n![](image)Broadway theatres in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City\nThe United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[485] In the 19th century, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[486]\n\n\nThe central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[487] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[488]\n\n\nAlthough earlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape,[489] theater still remains a popular contemporary American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theatergoers even as productions have become more elaborate and expensive.[490] The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018–19 season total attendance was 14,768,254 and $1,829,312,140 in grosses.[491]\n\n\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League[492] at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[493]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United States\n\n![](image)The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[494]\n\n\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large. The Smithsonian Institution states, \"African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.\"[495] One instrument first mass-produced in the United States was the banjo, which had originally been crafted from gourds covered by animal skins by African slaves.[496][497] Banjos became widely popular in the 19th century due to their use in minstrel shows.[496] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[498]\n\n\nThe United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in 2014.[499] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[500] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing musical acts in worldwide sales.[501][502][503] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[504] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[505] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[498] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey,[506][507] and of the early 21th century, such as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga.[508] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[509] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Renée Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[510]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States\n\n![](image)*Nighthawks* (1942) by Edward Hopper is one of his best-known works, Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[511] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[512]\n\n\nThe uniquely American \"Chicago School\" refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in European modernism. Much of its early work is known as \"Commercial Style\".[513] A \"Second Chicago School\" with a modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems, such as the tube-frame structure.[514] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[515]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of the United States\n\n![](image)The iconic Hollywood Sign, in the Hollywood Hills, often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[516][517][518] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[519][520] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[521] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[522] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[523]\n\n\nDirector D. W. Griffith's film adaptation of *The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan* was the first American blockbuster, earning the equivalent of $1.8 billion in current dollars. The technical achievements of the film revolutionized film grammar, while its subject matter caused both strident protest and a revitalization of the Klan.[524] Producer and entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[525] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[526] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[527][528] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[529] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[530] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[531][532]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American cuisine\n\nFurther information: List of American regional and fusion cuisines\n\n![](image)A bacon cheeseburger served with french fries, fried onions and ketchup\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[533] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[534][535] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[536]\n\n\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[537][538][539][540] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[541]\n\n\nThe American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[542] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's,[543] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among others, have numerous outlets around the world,[544]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in the United States\n\nSee also: Professional sports leagues in the United States, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and United States at the Olympics\n\n![](image)American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey, according to a 2017 *Gallup* poll.[545] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[546] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[547] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[548]\n\n\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[549] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[550] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[551][552]\n\n\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[553] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[554] In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.[555]\n\n\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[556] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[557][558][559]\n\n\nIn international soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[560] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[561]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of U.S. state topics\n* Outline of the United States\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 30 of 50 states recognize only English as an official language.

It is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery (primarily of Africans) led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. However, racial discrimination and inequality continued into subsequent centuries. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon, notably with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n\n\nThe United States government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been extensively shaped by the world's largest immigrant population.\n\n\nHighly developed, the U.S. has by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by nominal GDP. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter, as well as the largest consumer market. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of the United States and Demonyms for the United States\n\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[28][29][30] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in *The Virginia Gazette* newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[31]\n\n\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[32][33] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of United States history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)Cliff Palace, located in present-day Colorado, was built by Ancestral Puebloans.\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000BC, is believed to represent the first widespread culture in the Americas.[37][38] The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward.[39]\n\n\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in present-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region in present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Algonquian were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. Before European immigrants made contact, most of the Algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the \"Three Sisters\". By the time of European contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands' productivity and manage land.[43][44][45][46][47][48] The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[49] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[50] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants[51][52] range from around 500,000[53][51] to nearly 10 million.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Colonization (1492–1763)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial history of the United States\n\n![](image)British North America in 1775 with the 13 colonies shown in red\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, and Spain soon established Spanish Florida on the mainland.[54][55] \nThe Spanish Empire set up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in Saint Augustine (1565), which is often considered the nation's oldest city,[56] and Santa Fe (1598). The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in the present-day New York Bay region.[57] The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New Orleans (1718) and Mobile (1702).[58]\nBritish colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[59][60] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England seeking religious freedom.[61] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[62][63]\n\n\nDuring 17th-century European colonization, settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, particularly in King Philip's War, but often came to develop a mutual dependency. Settlers traded guns, tools, and European goods for food and animal pelts.[64] Native Americans taught settlers to cultivate local foods. Colonial authorities often pursued policies to to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urge or force them to adopt European lifestyles.[65][66] The native population of America declined after European arrival,[67][68][69] primarily as a result of infectious diseases brought from Europe such as smallpox and measles,[70][71] and native peoples were displaced by European expansion.[72]\n\n\nEuropean settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.[73] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the Southern Colonies.[74] Southern tobacco colonies passed laws designed to keep African Americans subservient.[75][76][77]\n\n\nThe original Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered by Great Britain.[78] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some areas, Catholics.[79][80] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[81] By the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[82] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance, [83] and the First Great Awakening—a series of Christian revivals—fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[84]\n\n\n\n### Revolution and the new nation (1763–1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1776–1789)\n\nFurther information: American Enlightenment\n\n![See caption](image)*Declaration of Independence*, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia\nAfter the British victory in the French and Indian War, won largely through the support from the colonies, the British began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. In 1774, to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the British government that extracted taxes from them, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The British attempted to disarm the Americans, resulting in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and charged a committee led by Thomas Jefferson with writing a Declaration of Independence.[85]\n\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.[86] After the surrender of a second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day Canada in the north to Florida in the south.[87] Washington resigned his commission, returned to private life, and the Continental Army was disbanded. \n\n\n\n![](image)*The Old Plantation*, a c. 1790 painting of a plantation by a South Carolina slaveholder\nRatified by the states in 1781 and based on the concept of \"consent of the governed\", the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[86] Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,[88] the Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states.[89] The prohibition of slavery in the Northwest Territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as an extension of the Mason–Dixon line, the geographic and political divide between slave states and free states.[90][91]\n\n\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was drafted. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[92] Ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789, reorganizing the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington was elected the nation's first President under the new constitution and returned to public life. The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by sceptics of the more centralized national government.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### Expansion (1789–1860)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1789–1849)\n ![](image)Animated map of the territorial evolution of the United States (click to view full size image)\nDuring the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies. However, during the American Revolution, many began to question the practice.[95] Founding Fathers in the northern United States advocated for the abolition of slavery, and slavery was abolished in Northern states.[96] The increased profitability for southern elites after the cotton gin lowered production costs entrenched support for slavery in the southern United States.[97][98][99]\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, with a sense of manifest destiny.[100] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) nearly doubled the territory of the United States, and effectively ended French opposition to America's westward expansion.[101] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a virtual draw but established the United States as capable of defending itself.[102] Spain ceded Florida and their Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[103] The Missouri Compromise (1820) admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, dividing the country into free states, which forbade slavery, and slave states, which protected the institution.[104] [105]\n\n\nAs Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[106][107] The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River.[108][109] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[105] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[110] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, resulting in the U.S. stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.[100][111]\n\n\n\n### Civil War and Reconstruction (1860–1876)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1849–1865) and 1865–1918\n\n![](image)Division of the states during the American Civil War\n * Union states\n* Border states\n* Confederate states\n* Territories\nSectional conflict regarding slavery[112] culminated in the American Civil War.[113] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states (the Union) maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[114] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston, South Carolina. The ensuing Civil War (1861–1865) became the deadliest military conflict in American history.[115] In 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor following the Siege of Vicksburg led by General Ulysses S. Grant, which gave them control of the Mississippi River, and the Battle of Gettysburg, where the Union Army halted Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered.[116]\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Chinese railroad workers on the Central Pacific Railroad, 1870\nThe Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Radical Republicans passed the Reconstruction Amendments to ensure the rights of African Americans. The biracial Southern governments were opposed by terrorist and paramilitary organizations. To encourage additional westward settlement the Homestead Acts allowed an applicant to acquire ownership of government land, by residing there. More than 160 million acres (650 thousand km2; 250 thousand sq mi)—nearly 10 percent of the total area of the United States—were given away free to 1.6 million homesteaders. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 was enacted to break a cycle of debt during Reconstruction. This act attempted to sell land at low prices so marginalized Southerners could buy it, but many were still too poor to afford the lower prices.[117] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred growth in the American Old West. New transcontinental railways made relocation easier, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[118]\n\n\n\n### Development of the modern United States (1876–1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1865–1918)\n\n![](image)An October 24th, 1874 Harper's Magazine editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast denouncing Ku Klux Klan and White League murders of African Americans\nThe Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[119][120] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[121] From 1890 to 1910, the Southern States established Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all African Americans. Racial segregation was prevalent nationwide and discrimination was codified, especially in the South,[122] while well into the 20th century lynching and other forms of unjustified vigilante violence often went unprosecuted.[123][124]\n\n\nTerritorial expansion continued apace. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[125] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish–American War.[126] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but through the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917,[127] allowing for the conscription of 20,000 Puerto Ricans, which began two months later.[128] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[129] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[130]\n\n\n\nAn Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[131][132]\nFrom 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe including Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Russia, and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.[133] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892 specifically through the now iconic Ellis Island. New York and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[134] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[135]\n\n\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[136] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[137] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[138][139][140] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[141]\n\n\n\n### World Wars period (1914–1945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1918–1945)\n\n![](image)The Trinity nuclear test in the Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945, part of the Manhattan Project and the first detonation of a nuclear weapon\nThe early 20th century was a time of industrial expansion and social change in the United States.[142][143] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[144] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[145] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the United States.[146] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[147][148]\n\n\nAt first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[149][150] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them again the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[151][152] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[153][154] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.[155]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary United States (1945–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), 1964–1980, 1980–1991, and 1991–2008\n\n![See caption](image)Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.\nAfter World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate the affairs of other countries.[156] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[157][158][159][160][161] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[162]\n\n\nThe civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[163] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable for recreational drug use, sexuality[164][165] and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in Vietnam.[166] The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, which led to a decline in public trust in government.[167]\n\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s saw economic stagflation and President Ronald Reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[168][169][170][171] By 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[172] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[173][174][175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Twin Towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks, 2001\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, the U.S. faced challenges from terrorism, with the September 11 attacks in 2001 leading to the war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[177][178] The U.S. housing bubble in 2006 culminated in the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[179] Amid the financial crisis, Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, was elected in 2008.[180][181]\n\n\nPolitical polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated political discussion.[182] The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 100 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths,[183] making it the most deadly pandemic in U.S. history.[184] Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election culminated in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power.[185]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the United States\n\n![](image)A topographic map of the United States\nThe United States is the world's third-largest nation by land and total area behind Russia and Canada.[c][186][187] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2).[188][189] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[190]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[191] The Mississippi River System—the world's fourth longest river system—runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[191]\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[192] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[193] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[194] about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[195] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[196] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[197]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Köppen climate types of the United States\nMain articles: Climate of the United States and Climate change in the United States\n\nWith its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[198] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[199]\n\n\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[200] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[201] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[202]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States\n\n![A bald eagle](image)The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States since 1782[203]\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[204] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[205] and 91,000 insect species.[206]\n\n\nThere are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[207] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[208] primarily in the western states.[209] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for industrial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[210][211]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biological diversity, logging and deforestation,[212][213] and climate change.[214][215] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[216] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[217] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[218] As of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[219] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[220]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Constitution of the United States, Politics of the United States, and Government of the United States\n\nFurther information: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, Political ideologies in the United States, American patriotism, and American civil religion\n\n![](image)The Capitol and its two legislative chambers, the Senate (left) and the House of Representatives (right)\n![](image)The White House, the residence and workplace of the U.S. President and the offices of the presidential staff\n![](image)The Supreme Court Building, which houses the nation's highest court\nThe United States was founded on the principles of the American Enlightenment. It is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[221][222] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and, according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[223] It is a liberal representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\"[224] The U.S. Constitution serves as the country's supreme legal document, establishing the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states.[225]\n\n\nThe federal government comprises three branches, which are headquartered in Washington, D.C. and regulated by a system of checks and balances.[226]\n\n\n\n* The U.S. Congress, a bicameral legislature, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[227] and has the power of impeachment.[228] The Senate has 100 members (2 from each state), elected for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members from single member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of population, elected for a two-year term.\n* The U.S. President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies through their respective agencies.[229] The president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election.[230] It is an indirect election, with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the Electoral College. The President and Vice President serve a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice.\n* The U.S. federal judiciary, whose judges are all appointed for life by the President with Senate approval, consists primarily of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[231] The Supreme Court is led by the chief justice of the United States. It has nine members who serve for life. The members are appointed by the sitting president when a vacancy becomes available.[232]\n\n\n### Political subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Political divisions of the United States, State government in the United States, Local government in the United States, and U.S. state\n\nFurther information: List of states and territories of the United States, Indian reservation, and Territories of the United States\n\nSee also: Territorial evolution of the United States\n\nIn the American federal system, sovereignty is shared between two levels of government: federal and state. Each of the 50 states has territory where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[233] The territories and the District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government.[234]\n\n![](image)\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States\n\n![see caption](image)The United Nations headquarters has been situated along the East River in Midtown Manhattan since 1952; in 1945, the United States was a founding member of the UN.\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019.[235] It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[236] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[237] The United States is a member of the G7,[238] G20,[239] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[240] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[241] North Korea,[242] and Bhutan.[243] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[244] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[245]\n\n\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[246] and strong ties with Canada,[247] Australia,[248] New Zealand,[249] the Philippines,[250] Japan,[251] South Korea,[252] Israel,[253] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[254] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[255] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[256] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[257] and its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[258][259] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine.[260][261]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Armed Forces and Military history of the United States\n\n![](image)The Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Edgar Hoover Building, the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nThere are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to federal level in the United States.[269] Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and sheriff departments in their municipal or county jurisdictions. The state police departments have authority in their respective state, and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have national jurisdiction and specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[270] State courts conduct most civil and criminal trials,[271] and federal courts handle designated crimes and appeals of state court decisions.[272]\n\n\nAs of January 2023, the United States has the sixth highest per-capita incarceration rate in the world, at 531 people per 100,000;

Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled America's large-scale manufacturing of consumer products in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[322] In 2022, the United States was the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers.[323] As of 2021, the U.S. ranked second by the number of patent applications, and third by trademark and industrial design applications.[324] In 2022, the United States ranked 3rd in the Global Innovation Index.[325]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], the United States receives approximately 79.1% of its energy from fossil fuels.[326] In 2021, the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (36.1%), followed by natural gas (32.2%), coal (10.8%), renewable sources (12.5%), and nuclear power (8.4%).[326] The United States constitutes less than 5% of the world's population, but consumes 17% of the world's energy.[327][328] The U.S. ranks as the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases.[329]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in the United States\n\n![](image)Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, is the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic with over 93 million passengers annually in 2022.[330]\nPersonal transportation in the United States is dominated by automobiles,[331][332] which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads, making it the longest network in the world.[333][334] The Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the Ford Model T, both American cars, are considered the first mass-produced[335] and mass-affordable[336] cars, respectively. As of 2022, the United States is the second-largest manufacturer of motor vehicles.[337] Currently, the American automotive industry is the world's second-largest automobile market by sales,[338] and the U.S. has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, [339] with 910 vehicles per 1000 people.[340] The United States's rail network, the longest in the world,[341] handles mostly freight.[342][343]\n\n\nThe American civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[344] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[345] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the top five and the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[346][347] As of 2020[update], there are 19,919 airports in the United States, of which 5,217 are designated as \"public use\", including for general aviation and other activities.[348]\n\n\nOf the fifty busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, of which the busiest is the Port of Los Angeles.[349] The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, and total 41,009 km (25,482 mi).[350]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of the United States\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Americans and Race and ethnicity in the United States\n\nSee also: List of U.S. states by population\n\n![](image)United States population density map based on Census 2010 data\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020,[m][351] making the United States the third-most populous nation in the world, after China and India.[352] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January 28, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[353] In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[354] In 2021, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.7 children per woman,[355] and it had the world's highest rate of children (23%) living in single-parent households in 2019.[356]\n\n\nThe United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[357] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa, form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population.[358][359] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the nation's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total United States population.[357] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population, while the country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%.[357] In 2020, the median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.[352]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the United States\n\n![](image)Most spoken languages in USA\nWhile many languages are spoken in the United States, English is overwhelmingly the most commonly spoken in a majority of the country.[360] Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English, and most states have declared English as the official language.[361] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[362] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[n][363] South Dakota (Sioux),[364] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[365]\n\n\nAccording to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[366]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to the United States\n\nAmerica's immigrant population, numbering more than 50 million, is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[367][368] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[369] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[370] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[371] The United States has led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[372]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligious affiliation in USA, per Gallup, Inc. (2022)[373]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (34%)\nCatholicism (23%)\nNon-specific Christian (11%)\nMormonism (2%)\nJudaism (2%)\nOther religions (6%)\nUnaffiliated (21%)\nNo answer (1%)\n\nMain articles: Religion in the United States and Irreligion in the United States\n\nSee also: List of religious movements that began in the United States\n\nThe First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.[374][375] Religious practice is widespread, among the most diverse in the world,[376] and vibrant, with the country being far more religious than other wealthy Western nations.[377] An overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power,[378] engage in spiritual practices such as prayer,[379] and consider themselves religious or spiritual.[380][381] The country has the world's largest Christian population.[382] A majority of the global Jewish population lives in the United States, as measured by the Law of Return.[383]\n\n\nA 2022 *Gallup* poll found that 31% reported \"attending a church, synagogue, mosque or temple weekly or nearly weekly\".[384] Religious practice varies significantly by region.[385] In the \"Bible Belt\", located within the Southern United States, evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally. New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious,[385] although Mormonism—a Restorationist Christian movement started in New York in the 19th century—is the predominant religious affiliation in Utah.[386]\n\n\nAround 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith.[387] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.[388] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[389] Religious belief and interest has remained relatively stable in recent years; organizational participation, in contrast, has decreased.[390] Other notable faiths include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, many New Age movements, and a large variety of Native American religions.[391]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population\n\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[186] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[392] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[393] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[394]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in the United States2023 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[395]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |  |\n| ![New York](image)New York![Los Angeles](image)Los Angeles | 1 | New York | Northeast | 19,498,249 | 11 | Boston | Northeast | 4,919,179\n | ![Chicago](image)Chicago![Dallas–Fort Worth](image)Dallas–Fort Worth |\n| 2 | Los Angeles | West | 12,799,100 | 12 | Riverside–San Bernardino | West | 4,688,053\n |\n| 3 | Chicago | Midwest | 9,262,825 | 13 | San Francisco | West | 4,566,961\n |\n| 4 | Dallas–Fort Worth | South | 8,100,037 | 14 | Detroit | Midwest | 4,342,304\n |\n| 5 | Houston | South | 7,510,253 | 15 | Seattle | West | 4,044,837\n |\n| 6 | Atlanta | South | 6,307,261 | 16 | Minneapolis–Saint Paul | Midwest | 3,712,020\n |\n| 7 | Washington, D.C. | South | 6,304,975 | 17 | Tampa–St. Petersburg | South | 3,342,963\n |\n| 8 | Philadelphia | Northeast | 6,246,160 | 18 | San Diego | West | 3,269,973\n |\n| 9 | Miami | South | 6,183,199 | 19 | Denver | West | 3,005,131\n |\n| 10 | Phoenix | West | 5,070,110 | 20 | Baltimore | South | 2,834,316\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Healthcare in the United States, Healthcare reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\n\n![The Texas Medical Center, a cluster of contemporary skyscrapers, at night](image)Texas Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, employing 106,000 people and treating 10 million patients annually as of 2016.[396]\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. The chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[397][398] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Black and American Indian–Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[399][400] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[401] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[402] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[403] Poverty is the 4th leading risk factor for premature death in the United States annually, according to a 2023 study published in *JAMA*.[404][405]\n\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations.[406] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[407]\n\n\nGovernment-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[o][408] with the law roughly halving the uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[409] Its legacy remains controversial.[410]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States\n\n![Photograph of the University of Virginia](image)The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of many public colleges and universities in the United States.\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[411] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[412] The basic literacy rate is near-universal.[186][413] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).[414][415]\n\n\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education including many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[416][417][418] There are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[419] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[420] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[421]\n\n\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[422] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[423] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[424] and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of 2022.[425]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of the United States and Society of the United States\n\n![The Statue of Liberty, a large teal bronze sculpture on a stone pedestal](image)The Statue of Liberty (*Liberty Enlightening the World*) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream.[426]\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[427][428] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[429][430] having a strong work ethic,[431] competitiveness,[432] and voluntary altruism towards others.[433][434][435] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.[436] Part of both the Anglosphere and Western World, the United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[437][438] and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale,[439][440] with the phenomenon being termed *Americanization*.[441] As such, the U.S. is considered a cultural superpower.[442]\n\n\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[443] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[437][444] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[437] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[445] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[446][447][448][449] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[450] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[451] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[452]\n\n\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[453] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[454][455][456] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[457] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[458] It is a socially progressive country[459] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[460] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world.[460][461][462]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American literature and American philosophy\n\n![Photograph of Mark Twain](image)Mark Twain, who William Faulkner called \"the father of American literature\"[463]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[464]\n\n\nAlmost until the 20th century pervasive anti-literacy laws prevented most people of color from learning to read or write.[465][466] In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated from the Southern United States and West Indies. Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the *négritude* philosophy.[467]\n\n\nSince its first use in the 19th century, the term \"Great American Novel\" has been applied to many books, including Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852), Twain's *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* (1925), John Steinbeck's *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939), Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1960), Toni Morrison's *Beloved* (1987), and David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* (1996).[468][469][470]\n\n\nThirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise Glück, Bob Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[471] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck have been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[472]\n\n\n\n### Mass media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mass media in the United States\n\nSee also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, Radio in the United States, and Video games in the United States\n\n![](image)Comcast Center in Philadelphia, headquarters of Comcast, the world's largest telecommunications and media conglomerate\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[473] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[474] As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[475] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[476]\n\n\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *USA Today*.[477] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[478][479] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as *The Village Voice* in New York City and *LA Weekly* in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[480]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the video game market of the United States is the world's largest by revenue.[481] Major video game publishers and developers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[482][483] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[484]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theater in the United States\n\n![](image)Broadway theatres in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City\nThe United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[485] In the 19th century, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[486]\n\n\nThe central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[487] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[488]\n\n\nAlthough earlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape,[489] theater still remains a popular contemporary American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theatergoers even as productions have become more elaborate and expensive.[490] The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018–19 season total attendance was 14,768,254 and $1,829,312,140 in grosses.[491]\n\n\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League[492] at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[493]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United States\n\n![](image)The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[494]\n\n\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large. The Smithsonian Institution states, \"African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.\"[495] One instrument first mass-produced in the United States was the banjo, which had originally been crafted from gourds covered by animal skins by African slaves.[496][497] Banjos became widely popular in the 19th century due to their use in minstrel shows.[496] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[498]\n\n\nThe United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in 2014.[499] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[500] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing musical acts in worldwide sales.[501][502][503] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[504] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[505] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[498] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey,[506][507] and of the early 21th century, such as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga.[508] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[509] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Renée Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[510]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States\n\n![](image)*Nighthawks* (1942) by Edward Hopper is one of his best-known works, Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[511] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[512]\n\n\nThe uniquely American \"Chicago School\" refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in European modernism. Much of its early work is known as \"Commercial Style\".[513] A \"Second Chicago School\" with a modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems, such as the tube-frame structure.[514] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[515]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of the United States\n\n![](image)The iconic Hollywood Sign, in the Hollywood Hills, often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[516][517][518] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[519][520] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[521] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[522] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[523]\n\n\nDirector D. W. Griffith's film adaptation of *The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan* was the first American blockbuster, earning the equivalent of $1.8 billion in current dollars. The technical achievements of the film revolutionized film grammar, while its subject matter caused both strident protest and a revitalization of the Klan.[524] Producer and entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[525] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[526] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[527][528] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[529] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[530] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[531][532]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American cuisine\n\nFurther information: List of American regional and fusion cuisines\n\n![](image)A bacon cheeseburger served with french fries, fried onions and ketchup\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[533] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[534][535] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[536]\n\n\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[537][538][539][540] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[541]\n\n\nThe American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[542] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's,[543] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among others, have numerous outlets around the world,[544]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in the United States\n\nSee also: Professional sports leagues in the United States, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and United States at the Olympics\n\n![](image)American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey, according to a 2017 *Gallup* poll.[545] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[546] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[547] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[548]\n\n\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[549] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[550] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[551][552]\n\n\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[553] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[554] In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.[555]\n\n\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[556] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[557][558][559]\n\n\nIn international soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[560] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[561]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of U.S. state topics\n* Outline of the United States\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 30 of 50 states recognize only English as an official language.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world's second-largest country by total area, with the world's longest coastline. Its border with the United States is the world's longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely inhabited country of 40 million people, the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, and culminating in the *Canada Act 1982*, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nCanada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is \"called upon\" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and gender equality. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.\n\n\nA developed country, Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs, with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has had a significant influence on its global image. Canada is part of multiple major international and intergovernmental institutions.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Canada\n\nWhile a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of *Canada*, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word *kanata*, meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\".[9] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word *Canada* to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as *Canada*.[10]\n\n\nFrom the 16th to the early 18th century, \"Canada\" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These two colonies were collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12]\n\n\nUpon Confederation in 1867, *Canada* was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word *dominion* was conferred as the country's title.[13] By the 1950s, the term *Dominion of Canada* was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"realm of the Commonwealth\".[14]\n\n\nThe *Canada Act 1982*, which brought the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to *Canada*. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[15] The term *Dominion* was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term *federal* had replaced *dominion*.[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Canada\n\nFurther information: Timeline of Canadian history and Historiography of Canada\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nIndigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis,[17] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity.[17]\n\n\nThe first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.[18][19] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.[20] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.[21][22] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.[23]\n\n\n\n![Colour-coded map of North America showing the distribution of North American language families north of Mexico](image)Linguistic areas of North American Indigenous peoples at the time of European contact[24]\nThe Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000[25] and two million,[26] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.[27] As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared.[28] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity,[25][29] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.[30][31]\n\n\nAlthough not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.[32] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade.[33] These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties.[34][35] From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society.[36] These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration through state-funded boarding schools,[37] health-care segregation,[38] and displacement.[39] A period of redress began with the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.[40] This included recognition of past colonial injustices and settlement agreements and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### European colonization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of territorial claims in North America by 1750. Possessions of British America (pink), New France (blue), and New Spain (orange); California, Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin not indicated.[42]\nIt is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson.[43][44] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland.[45] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England.[46] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words, \"long live the King of France\", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I.[47] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[48] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[49][50]\n\n\nIn 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp.[51] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence.[45] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[52] Among the colonists of New France, *Canadiens* extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.[53] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.[54]\n\n\nThe English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the Thirteen Colonies to the south.[55][56] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[57] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.[58]\n\n\n\n### British North America[edit]\n\n\n![Painting of General Wolfe dying in front of the British flag while attended by officers and native allies](image)Benjamin West's *The Death of General Wolfe* (1771) dramatizes James Wolfe's death during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec.[59]\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[15] St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769.[60] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.[61] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.[62] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.[63] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.[15]\n\n\nAfter the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[64] The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city.[65] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.[66]\n\n\n\n![Painting of Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams](image)War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams[67]\nThe Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed.[68] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850.[69] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances.[70] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.[25]\n\n\nThe desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[71] The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.[15] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.[72] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[73] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–BC border.[74]\n\n\n\n### Confederation and expansion[edit]\n\n\n![Refer to caption](image)Animated map showing the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories since Confederation in 1867[75]\nFollowing three constitutional conferences, the *British North America Act, 1867* officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.[76][77] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[78] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[79] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.[80] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[80] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US.[81]\n\n\nTo open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), passed the *Dominion Lands Act* to regulate settlement and established the North-West Mounted Police to assert authority over the territory.[82][83] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to \"Indian reserves\",[84] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements.[85] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land.[86] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands.[87] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves.[88] During this time, Canada introduced the *Indian Act* extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.[89]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century[edit]\n\n\n1918 Canadian War bond posters depicting three French women pulling a plow that had been constructed for horses\n![](image)\nFrench version of the poster roughly translates as \"They serve France–Everyone can serve; Buy Victory Bonds\".\n![](image)\nThe same poster in English, with subtle differences in text. \"They serve France—How can I serve Canada? Buy Victory Bonds\".\n\nBecause Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War.[90] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war.[91] Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded.[92] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers.[93] The *Military Service Act* brought in compulsory military service, though it, coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party.[93] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain,[91] and the *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, affirmed Canada's independence.[94]\n\n\nThe Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.[95] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s.[96] On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.[91]\n\n\nThe first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the Second World War and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.[97] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[91] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany.[98]\n\n\nThe Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union.[91] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.[99]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary era[edit]\n\n\nThe financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor.[100] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.[101]\n\n\nCanada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965,[102] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[103] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[104] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.[105]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)A copy of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*[106]\nFinally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the *Canada Act 1982*, the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.[107][108][109] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own monarchy.[110][111] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.[112]\n\n\nAt the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement.[113] The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970,[114] and the sovereignist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[115] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[116][117] A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[118] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional, and the Clarity Act was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.[115]\n\n\nIn addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;[119] the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students;[120] and the Oka Crisis of 1990,[121] the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups.[122] Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United States–led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.[123] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 but declined to join the United States–led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[124]\n\n\nIn 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War[125] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[126] The country celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2017, three years before the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27, 2020, with widespread social and economic disruption.[127] In 2021, the possible graves of hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools.[128] Administered by various Christian churches and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997, these boarding schools attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.[37]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Canada\n\n![refer to caption](image)A topographic map of Canada, in polar projection (for 90° W), showing elevations shaded from green to brown (higher)\nBy total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.[129] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes.[130] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory.[131] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi).[132][133] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States—spanning 8,891 km (5,525 mi)[a]—Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island,[134] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast.[135] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.[136]\n\n\nCanada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Arctic Archipelago.[137] Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northern Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[131] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada's economic output.[131] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of which are larger than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)—containing much of the world's fresh water.[138][139] There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains, and the Arctic Cordillera.[140] Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[141]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Temperature in Canada\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification types of Canada\nAverage winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[142] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[143]\n\n\nMuch of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost. The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[144] Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[131] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[145] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity in Canada.[146]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Canada\n\n![Map showing Canada divided into different ecozones](image)Terrestrial ecozones and ecoprovinces of Canada. Ecozones are identified with a unique colour. Ecoprovinces are subdivisions of ecozones and are identified with a unique numeric code.[147]\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[148] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[149] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries,[150] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost.[151] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\".[152] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[153] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 km2 (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[154] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions,[155] with 42 percent of its land area covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land).[156]\n\n\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park established in 1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi)[158] of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes.[159] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park, established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01 sq mi). It is dominated by old-growth forest with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers.[160] Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) of lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) of islands and mainland.[161] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area, which spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45 sq mi)[162] and protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia's seabirds.[163] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves cover a total area of 235,000 square kilometres (91,000 sq mi).[164]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Canada and Politics of Canada\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Canadian Parliament Buildings and their surroundings\nCanada is described as a \"full democracy\",[165] with a tradition of liberalism,[166] and an egalitarian,[167] moderate political ideology.[168] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.[169][170] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of the Canadian government.[171][172]\n\n\nAt the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising \"brokerage politics\":[b] the centre-left leaning Liberal Party of Canada[179][180] and the centre-right leaning Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors).[181] The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale.[181] Five parties had representatives elected to the Parliament in the 2021 election—the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official Opposition; the New Democratic Party (occupying the left[182][183]); the Bloc Québécois; and the Green Party of Canada.[184] Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.[185][186][187]\n\n\nCanada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy—the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[188][189][190][191] The reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other Commonwealth countries (though, all are sovereign of one another[192]) and each of Canada's 10 provinces. To carry out most of their federal royal duties in Canada, the monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister.[193][194]\n\n\n\n![King Charles III](image)\nCharles III, King of Canada\n![Governor General Mary Simon](image)\nMary Simon, Governor General of Canada\n![Prime Minister Justin Trudeau](image)\nJustin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada\n\nThe monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada.[191][195][196] However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in certain rare crisis situations,[195] the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative) is otherwise always directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister,[197] the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House of Commons.[198] The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies.[195] The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.[199]\n\n\n\n![The House of Commons chamber](image)The House of Commons in its temporary location, the West Block[200]\nThe Parliament of Canada passes all statute laws within the federal sphere. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the Senate. While Canada inherited the British concept of parliamentary supremacy, this was later, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law.[201]\n\n\nEach of the 338 members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The *Constitution Act, 1982*, requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the *Canada Elections Act* limits this to four years with a \"fixed\" election date in October; general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in the House.[202][203] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.[204]\n\n\nCanadian federalism divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons.[196] Canada's three territories also have legislatures; but, these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.[205] The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.[206]\n\n\nThe Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country.[207] The minister of finance and minister of innovation, science, and industry use the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development.[208] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes.[209] The bank does not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.[210]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Canada\n\nThe Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions.[211] The *Constitution Act, 1867* (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments.[212] The *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, granted full autonomy, and the *Constitution Act, 1982*, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.[213] The *Charter* guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government; though, a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the *Charter* for a period of five years.[214]\n\n\n\n![Supreme Court of Canada building](image)The Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill\nCanada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since December 18, 2017, by Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of Canada.[215] The governor general appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice.[216] The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.[217]\n\n\nCommon law prevails everywhere, except in Quebec, where civil law predominates.[218] Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.[219] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.[220] In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police.[221]\n\n\nCanadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada.[222] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples.[223] Most notably, a series of 11 treaties, known as the Numbered Treaties, were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.[224] These treaties are agreements between the Canadian Crown-in-Council, with the duty to consult and accommodate.[225] The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.[223] These rights may include provision of services, such as healthcare through the Indian Health Transfer Policy, and exemption from taxation.[226]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations and military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of Canada, Canadian Armed Forces, and Military history of Canada\n\n![Canadian Delegation to the United Nations seated around conference table](image)The Canadian delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization, San Francisco, May 1945[227]\nCanada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions.[228] Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions, international organizations, and the work of numerous federal institutions.[229][230] Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image.[231][232] The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.[233]\n\n\nCanada and the United States have a long, complex, and intertwined relationship;[234][235] they are close allies, co-operating regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts.[236][237] Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France,[238] along with both countries' former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie*.[239] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.[98] Canada was a founding member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, the G20, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[228] Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs.[240] Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976.[241] The country joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001.[242] Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).[243]\n\n\nCanada's earlier strong attachment to the British Empire and, later, the Commonwealth, led it to make significant contributions to British military efforts in the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the First World War (1914–1918), and the Second World War (1939–1945).[244] Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.[245][246] During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), in cooperation with the United States, to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.[247]\n\n\n\n![A fighter jet taking off from a runway](image)A Canadian McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet in \"special markings\" used by the 2014 CF-18 Demonstration Team[248]\nDuring the Suez Crisis of 1956, future prime minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.[249] As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.[250] Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989,[91] and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere. Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia affair.[251]\n\n\nIn 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the US stabilization force and the UN-authorized, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.[252] In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925.[253]\n\n\nThe unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\"[254]—with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers.[255][c] In 2021, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.4 billion, or around 1.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).[257] Canada's total military expenditure is expected to reach $32.7 billion by 2027.[258] Canada's military currently has over 3000 personnel deployed overseas in multiple operations, such as Operation Snowgoose in Cyprus, Operation Unifier supporting Ukraine, Operation Caribbe in the Caribbean Sea, and Operation Impact, a coalition for the military intervention against ISIL.[259]\n\n\n\n### Provinces and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Provinces and territories of Canada\n\nSee also: Canadian federalism\n\n![Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces and territories](image)Political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories[260]\nCanada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories. In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (*Eastern Canada* refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[261] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and welfare,[262] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[263]\n\n\nThe major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown[264] and power and authority from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada[265] and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council,[266] rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively[267] and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment, while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.[268]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Canada\n\n![](image)The Toronto financial district is the second-largest financial centre in North America, the seventh-largest globally in employment and the heart of Canada's finance industry.[269]\nCanada has a highly developed mixed-market economy,[270][271] with the world's ninth-largest economy as of 2023[update], and a nominal GDP of approximately US$2.221 trillion.[272] It is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy.[273] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion.[274] Canada's exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States.[274] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion.[274] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion.[275]\n\n\nCanada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions.[276] It ranks low in the Corruption Perceptions Index (14th in 2023)[277] and \"is widely regarded as among the least corrupt countries of the world\".[278] It ranks high in the Global Competitiveness Report (14th in 2019)[279] and Global Innovation Index (15th in 2023).[280] Canada's economy ranks above most Western nations on The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom[281] and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity.[282] The country's average household disposable income per capita is \"well above\" the OECD average.[283] Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability[284][285] and foreign direct investment.[286][285]\n\n\nSince the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one.[287] Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce.[288] Among developed countries, Canada has an unusually important primary sector, of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent components.[289] Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby mines or sources of timber.[290]\n\n\n\n![](image)Canada\nCountries and territories with free-trade agreements[291]\n\nCanada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II.[292] The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry.[293] The Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994 (later replaced by the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement).[294] As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade agreements with 51 different countries.[291]\n\n\nCanada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.[289][295] Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas,[296] and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world.[297] The vast Athabasca oil sands and other oil reserves give Canada 13 percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world's third or fourth-largest.[298] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains.[299] The country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium.[300][301] Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.[302] The fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy.[303]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Canada\n\nIn 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9 billion on domestic research and development, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion.[304] As of 2023[update], the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine.[305] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index,[306] and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms.[307] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population.[308]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Canadian-built Space Shuttle robotic arm (left), referred to as Canadarm, transferred the P5 truss segment over to the Canadian-built space station robotic arm, referred to as Canadarm2.[309]\nCanada's developments in science and technology include the creation of the modern alkaline battery,[310] the discovery of insulin,[311] the development of the polio vaccine,[312] and discoveries about the interior structure of the atomic nucleus.[313] Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial cardiac pacemaker, mapping the visual cortex,[314][315] the development of the electron microscope,[316][317] plate tectonics, deep learning, multi-touch technology, and the identification of the first black hole, Cygnus X-1.[318] Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include stem cells, site-directed mutagenesis, T-cell receptor, and the identification of the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases.[315][319]\n\n\nThe Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research and developing rockets and satellites.[320] Canada was the third country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch.[321] Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2, Canadarm3 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle.[322] Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS, and MOST.[323] Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant.[324]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Canada and List of cities in Canada\n\n![](image)Canada population density map (2014)[325]\nThe 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure.[326] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023.[327] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.[328] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[329] driven mainly by economic policy and also family reunification.[330][331] A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted to Canada in 2021.[332] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 28,000 in 2018.[333] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas in the country, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[334]\n\n\nCanada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world.[326] Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north and approximately 95 percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north.[335] About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the border with the contiguous United States.[336] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living urban centres.[337] The most densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[338][335]\n\n\nThe majority of Canadians (81.1 percent) live in family households, 12.1 percent report living alone, and those living with other relatives or unrelated persons reported at 6.8 percent.[339] Fifty-one percent of households are couples with or without children, 8.7 percent are single-parent households, 2.9 percent are multigenerational households, and 29.3 percent are single-person households.[339]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in Canada2021 Canadian census[340]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |\n| 1 | Toronto | Ontario | 6,202,225 | 11 | London | Ontario | 543,551\n |\n| 2 | Montreal | Quebec | 4,291,732 | 12 | Halifax | Nova Scotia | 465,703\n |\n| 3 | Vancouver | British Columbia | 2,642,825 | 13 | Niagara Region | Ontario | 433,604\n |\n| 4 | Ottawa–Gatineau | Ontario–Quebec | 1,488,307 | 14 | Windsor | Ontario | 422,630\n |\n| 5 | Calgary | Alberta | 1,481,806 | 15 | Oshawa | Ontario | 415,311\n |\n| 6 | Edmonton | Alberta | 1,418,118 | 16 | Victoria | British Columbia | 397,237\n |\n| 7 | Quebec City | Quebec | 839,311 | 17 | Saskatoon | Saskatchewan | 317,480\n |\n| 8 | Winnipeg | Manitoba | 834,678 | 18 | Regina | Saskatchewan | 249,217\n |\n| 9 | Hamilton | Ontario | 785,184 | 19 | Sherbrooke | Quebec | 227,398\n |\n| 10 | Waterloo Region | Ontario | 575,847 | 20 | Kelowna | British Columbia | 222,162\n |\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic origins of people in Canada\n\nAccording to the 2021 Canadian census, over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\" were self-reported by Canadians.[341] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5 percent), North American (22.9 percent), Asian (19.3 percent), North American Indigenous (6.1 percent), African (3.8 percent), Latin, Central and South American (2.5 percent), Caribbean (2.1 percent), Oceanian (0.3 percent), and other (6 percent).[341][342] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent of Canadians reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent.[341]\n\n\n\n![](image)The top 168 ethnic or cultural origins self-reported by Canadians in the 2021 census[343]\nThe country's ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian[d] (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent).[347]\n\n\nOf the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021, approximately 25.4 million reported being \"White\", representing 69.8 percent of the population.[348] The Indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million individuals, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021.[348] One out of every four Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority,[349][e] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1 percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7 percent), and Black (1.5 million; 4.3 percent).[351]\n\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent.[352] In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups.[353] The 2021 census indicated that 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0 percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent.[354] In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada.[355]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Canada\n\n![Map of Canada with English speakers and French speakers at a percentage](image)Approximately 98 percent of Canadians can speak either or both English and French:[356]English – 57%\nEnglish and French – 16%\nFrench – 21%\nSparsely populated area ( < 0.4 persons per km2)\n\nA multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively.[339] As of the 2021 census, just over 7.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890).[339] Canada's federal government practises official bilingualism, which is applied by the commissioner of official languages in consonance with section 16 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* and the federal *Official Languages Act*. English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.[357]\n\n\nThe 1977 *Charter of the French Language* established French as the official language of Quebec.[358] Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec.[359] New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population.[360] There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island.[361]\n\n\nOther provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.[362] There are 11 Indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.[363] Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.[364] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory.[365]\n\n\nAdditionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, some of which are Indigenous.[366] American Sign Language (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools.[367] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec.[368]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Canada\n\n![](image)Freedom of religion sculpture by Marlene Hilton Moore at the McMurtry Gardens of Justice in Toronto[369]\nCanada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs.[370] The Constitution of Canada refers to God and the monarch carries the title of *Defender of the Faith*; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism.[371] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.[372]\n\n\nRates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s.[370] With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,[373] Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state.[374][375][376] Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives,[377] they still believe in God.[378] The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter throughout Canadian society and by the state.[379]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Roman Catholics representing 29.9 percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing 53.3 percent of the population,[f] are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6 percent.[382] Other faiths include Islam (4.9 percent), Hinduism (2.3 percent), Sikhism (2.1 percent), Buddhism (1.0 percent), Judaism (0.9 percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2 percent).[383] Canada has the second-largest national Sikh population, behind India.[384]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Canada\n\nHealthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare.[385][386] It is guided by the provisions of the *Canada Health Act* of 1984[387] and is universal.[388] Universal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country.\"[389] Around 30 percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector.[390] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry.[390] Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs.[391][390]\n\n\n\n![graph of expenditures as described in the caption](image)Health expenditure and financing by country. Total health expenditure per capita in US dollars (PPP).\nIn common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years.[339] Life expectancy is 81.1 years.[392] A 2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88 percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they \"had good or very good health\".[393] Eighty percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use.[394] Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among OECD countries, contributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of diabetes.[394] Four chronic diseases—cancer (leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes—account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada.[395][396]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that healthcare spending reached $308 billion, or 12.7 percent of Canada's GDP for that year.[397] In 2022, Canada's per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the OECD.[398] Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources.[399][400] The Commonwealth Fund's 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last.[401] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage.[401] An increasing problem in Canada's health system is a lack of healthcare professionals.[402]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Canada and Higher education in Canada\n\n![The University of Toronto campus](image)University College, seen through the main gate and up King's College Road, at Canada's largest post-secondary institution, the University of Toronto\nEducation in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments.[403] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and the curriculum is overseen by the province.[404][405] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary education and post-secondary. Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada.[406] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded.[407] Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada.[408] The largest university is the University of Toronto with over 85,000 students.[409] Four universities are regularly ranked among the top 100 world-wide, namely University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, McGill University, and McMaster University, with a total of 18 universities ranked in the top 500 worldwide.[410]\n\n\nAccording to a 2019 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world;[411] the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree.[411] Canada spends about 5.3 percent of its GDP on education.[412] The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student).[413] As of 2014[update], 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.[414]\n\n\nThe mandatory education age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years,[415] contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent.[416] Just over 60,000 children are homeschooled in the country as of 2016. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading,[417][418] ranking the overall knowledge and skills of Canadian 15-year-olds as the sixth-best in the world, although these scores have been declining in recent years. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, with the average student scoring 523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493 in 2015.[419][420]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Canada\n\n![](image)*Monument to Multiculturalism* by Francesco Pirelli, in Toronto\nCanada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities and policies that promote a \"just society\" are constitutionally protected.[421][422][423] Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized equality and inclusiveness for all its people.[424][425][426] The official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments[427] and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity.[428][429] In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture.[430]\n\n\nCanada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support.[431] Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy termination) and LGBT rights, and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.[432][433][434] Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the national park system, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[435][436]\n\n\nHistorically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art, and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity.[437] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.[438]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: National symbols of Canada and Canadian royal symbols\n\n![The mother beaver sculpture outside the House of Commons](image)*The mother beaver* on the Canadian parliament's Peace Tower.[439] The five flowers on the shield each represent an ethnicity—Tudor rose: English; Fleur de lis: French; thistle: Scottish; shamrock: Irish; and leek: Welsh.\nThemes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism.[440] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, cold climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols.[441] The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the Arms of Canada.[442] Canada's official tartan, known as the \"maple leaf tartan\", has four colours that reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the seasons—green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling.[443] The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.[444]\n\n\nOther prominent symbols include the national motto, \"*A mari usque ad mare*\" (\"From Sea to Sea\"),[445] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse, the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, Canadian horse, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies,[442] and, more recently, the totem pole and Inuksuk.[446] Canadian beer, maple syrup, tuques, canoes, nanaimo bars, butter tarts, and poutine are defined as uniquely Canadian.[446][447] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, and the beaver on the nickel.[448] An image of the previous monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, appears on $20 bank notes and the obverse of all current Canadian coins.[448]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canadian literature\n\nCanadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[449] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration.[450] This progressed into three major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality.[451] In recent decades, Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from around the world.[452] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best.[453]\n\n\nNumerous Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards,[454] including novelist, poet, and literary critic Margaret Atwood, who received two Booker Prizes;[455] Nobel laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English;[456] and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who wrote the novel *The English Patient*, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.[457] L. M. Montgomery produced a series of children's novels beginning in 1908 with *Anne of Green Gables*.[458]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Canada\n\n![](image)A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) satellite truck, used for live television broadcasts\nCanada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized.[459][460] The *Broadcasting Act* declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada\".[461] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.[462] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).[463]\n\n\nCanadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a \"handful of corporations\".[464] The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French.[465] In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec.[466]\n\n\nNon-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.[467] In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing.[468] Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.[469]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canadian art\n\n![Oil on canvas painting of a tree dominating its rocky landscape during a sunset](image)*The Jack Pine* by Tom Thomson. Oil on canvas, 1916, in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada.[470]\nArt in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its Indigenous peoples,[471] and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism.[472] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.[473]\n\n\nThe Canadian government has played a role in the development of Canadian culture through the department of Canadian Heritage, by giving grants to art galleries,[474] as well as establishing and funding art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada Council for the Arts, the national public arts funder, helping artists, art galleries and periodicals, and thus contributing to the development of Canada's cultural works.[475]\n\n\nCanadian visual art has been dominated by figures, such as painter Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven.[476] The latter were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston and commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the group in 1926.[477] Associated with the group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast.[478]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Canada\n\n![](image)Original publication of \"O Canada\", 1908\nCanadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes.[479] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, and television music video channels.[480] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music.[481] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world,[482] producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles.[483] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.[484] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards.[485] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.[486]\n\n\nPatriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years. The earliest work of patriotic music in Canada, \"The Bold Canadian\", was written in 1812.[487] \"The Maple Leaf Forever\", written in 1866, was a popular patriotic song throughout English Canada and, for many years, served as an unofficial national anthem.[488] \"O Canada\" was adopted as the official anthem in 1980.[489] Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906.[490]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Canada\n\n![](image)The Canadian men's national ice hockey team celebrates shortly after winning the gold medal final at the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nThe roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s,[491] culminating in the development and popularization of the major professional games of ice hockey, lacrosse, curling, basketball, baseball, soccer, and Canadian football.[492] Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse.[493] Other sports such as golf, volleyball, skiing, cycling, swimming, badminton, tennis, bowling, and the study of martial arts are all widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.[494] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.[495] There are numerous other sport \"halls of fame\" in Canada, such as the Hockey Hall of Fame.[495]\n\n\nCanada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States.[496] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, as well as three Major League Soccer teams and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional competitions include the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League, the Canadian Premier League, and the various curling tournaments sanctioned and organized by Curling Canada.[497]\n\n\nCanada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics[498]—though, particularly, the Winter Games as a \"winter sports nation\"—and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events such as the 1976 Summer Olympics,[499] the 1988 Winter Olympics,[500] the 2010 Winter Olympics,[501][502] and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[503] Most recently, Canada hosted the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto.[504] The country is scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and the United States.[505]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Canada portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Index of Canada-related articles\n* List of Canada-related topics by provinces and territories\n* Outline of Canada\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 6,416 km (3,987 mi) via the contiguous 48 states and 2,475 km (1,538 mi) via Alaska[133]\n2. **^** \"Brokerage politics: A Canadian term for successful big tent parties that embody a pluralistic catch-all approach to appeal to the median Canadian voter ... adopting centrist policies and electoral coalitions to satisfy the short-term preferences of a majority of electors who are not located on the ideological fringe.\"[173][174] \"The traditional *brokerage* model of Canadian politics leaves little room for ideology.\"[175][176][177][178]\n3. **^**  \"The Royal Canadian Navy is composed of approximately 8,400 full-time sailors and 5,100 part-time sailors.

Respondents generally are visibly European (Anglophones and Francophones) and no longer self-identify with their ethnic ancestral origins. This response is attributed to a multitude or generational distance from ancestral lineage.\"[345][346]\n5. **^** Indigenous peoples are not considered a visible minority in Statistics Canada calculations.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world's second-largest country by total area, with the world's longest coastline. Its border with the United States is the world's longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely inhabited country of 40 million people, the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, and culminating in the *Canada Act 1982*, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nCanada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is \"called upon\" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and gender equality. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.\n\n\nA developed country, Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs, with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has had a significant influence on its global image. Canada is part of multiple major international and intergovernmental institutions.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Canada\n\nWhile a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of *Canada*, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word *kanata*, meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\".[9] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word *Canada* to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as *Canada*.[10]\n\n\nFrom the 16th to the early 18th century, \"Canada\" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These two colonies were collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12]\n\n\nUpon Confederation in 1867, *Canada* was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word *dominion* was conferred as the country's title.[13] By the 1950s, the term *Dominion of Canada* was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"realm of the Commonwealth\".[14]\n\n\nThe *Canada Act 1982*, which brought the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to *Canada*. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[15] The term *Dominion* was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term *federal* had replaced *dominion*.[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Canada\n\nFurther information: Timeline of Canadian history and Historiography of Canada\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nIndigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis,[17] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity.[17]\n\n\nThe first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.[18][19] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.[20] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.[21][22] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.[23]\n\n\n\n![Colour-coded map of North America showing the distribution of North American language families north of Mexico](image)Linguistic areas of North American Indigenous peoples at the time of European contact[24]\nThe Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000[25] and two million,[26] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.[27] As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared.[28] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity,[25][29] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.[30][31]\n\n\nAlthough not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.[32] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade.[33] These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties.[34][35] From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society.[36] These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration through state-funded boarding schools,[37] health-care segregation,[38] and displacement.[39] A period of redress began with the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.[40] This included recognition of past colonial injustices and settlement agreements and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### European colonization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of territorial claims in North America by 1750. Possessions of British America (pink), New France (blue), and New Spain (orange); California, Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin not indicated.[42]\nIt is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson.[43][44] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland.[45] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England.[46] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words, \"long live the King of France\", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I.[47] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[48] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[49][50]\n\n\nIn 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp.[51] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence.[45] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[52] Among the colonists of New France, *Canadiens* extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.[53] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.[54]\n\n\nThe English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the Thirteen Colonies to the south.[55][56] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[57] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.[58]\n\n\n\n### British North America[edit]\n\n\n![Painting of General Wolfe dying in front of the British flag while attended by officers and native allies](image)Benjamin West's *The Death of General Wolfe* (1771) dramatizes James Wolfe's death during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec.[59]\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[15] St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769.[60] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.[61] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.[62] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.[63] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.[15]\n\n\nAfter the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[64] The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city.[65] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.[66]\n\n\n\n![Painting of Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams](image)War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams[67]\nThe Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed.[68] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850.[69] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances.[70] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.[25]\n\n\nThe desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[71] The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.[15] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.[72] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[73] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–BC border.[74]\n\n\n\n### Confederation and expansion[edit]\n\n\n![Refer to caption](image)Animated map showing the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories since Confederation in 1867[75]\nFollowing three constitutional conferences, the *British North America Act, 1867* officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.[76][77] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[78] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[79] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.[80] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[80] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US.[81]\n\n\nTo open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), passed the *Dominion Lands Act* to regulate settlement and established the North-West Mounted Police to assert authority over the territory.[82][83] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to \"Indian reserves\",[84] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements.[85] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land.[86] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands.[87] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves.[88] During this time, Canada introduced the *Indian Act* extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.[89]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century[edit]\n\n\n1918 Canadian War bond posters depicting three French women pulling a plow that had been constructed for horses\n![](image)\nFrench version of the poster roughly translates as \"They serve France–Everyone can serve; Buy Victory Bonds\".\n![](image)\nThe same poster in English, with subtle differences in text. \"They serve France—How can I serve Canada? Buy Victory Bonds\".\n\nBecause Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War.[90] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war.[91] Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded.[92] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers.[93] The *Military Service Act* brought in compulsory military service, though it, coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party.[93] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain,[91] and the *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, affirmed Canada's independence.[94]\n\n\nThe Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.[95] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s.[96] On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.[91]\n\n\nThe first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the Second World War and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.[97] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[91] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany.[98]\n\n\nThe Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union.[91] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.[99]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary era[edit]\n\n\nThe financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor.[100] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.[101]\n\n\nCanada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965,[102] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[103] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[104] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.[105]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)A copy of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*[106]\nFinally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the *Canada Act 1982*, the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.[107][108][109] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own monarchy.[110][111] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.[112]\n\n\nAt the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement.[113] The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970,[114] and the sovereignist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[115] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[116][117] A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[118] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional, and the Clarity Act was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.[115]\n\n\nIn addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;[119] the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students;[120] and the Oka Crisis of 1990,[121] the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups.[122] Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United States–led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.[123] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 but declined to join the United States–led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[124]\n\n\nIn 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War[125] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[126] The country celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2017, three years before the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27, 2020, with widespread social and economic disruption.[127] In 2021, the possible graves of hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools.[128] Administered by various Christian churches and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997, these boarding schools attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.[37]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Canada\n\n![refer to caption](image)A topographic map of Canada, in polar projection (for 90° W), showing elevations shaded from green to brown (higher)\nBy total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.[129] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes.[130] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory.[131] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi).[132][133] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States—spanning 8,891 km (5,525 mi)[a]—Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island,[134] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast.[135] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.[136]\n\n\nCanada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Arctic Archipelago.[137] Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northern Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[131] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada's economic output.[131] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of which are larger than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)—containing much of the world's fresh water.[138][139] There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains, and the Arctic Cordillera.[140] Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[141]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Temperature in Canada\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification types of Canada\nAverage winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[142] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[143]\n\n\nMuch of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost. The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[144] Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[131] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[145] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity in Canada.[146]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Canada\n\n![Map showing Canada divided into different ecozones](image)Terrestrial ecozones and ecoprovinces of Canada.

Ecoprovinces are subdivisions of ecozones and are identified with a unique numeric code.[147]\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[148] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[149] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries,[150] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost.[151] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\".[152] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[153] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 km2 (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[154] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions,[155] with 42 percent of its land area covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land).[156]\n\n\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park established in 1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi)[158] of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes.[159] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park, established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01 sq mi). It is dominated by old-growth forest with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers.[160] Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) of lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) of islands and mainland.[161] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area, which spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45 sq mi)[162] and protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia's seabirds.[163] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves cover a total area of 235,000 square kilometres (91,000 sq mi).[164]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Canada and Politics of Canada\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Canadian Parliament Buildings and their surroundings\nCanada is described as a \"full democracy\",[165] with a tradition of liberalism,[166] and an egalitarian,[167] moderate political ideology.[168] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.[169][170] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of the Canadian government.[171][172]\n\n\nAt the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising \"brokerage politics\":[b] the centre-left leaning Liberal Party of Canada[179][180] and the centre-right leaning Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors).[181] The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale.[181] Five parties had representatives elected to the Parliament in the 2021 election—the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official Opposition; the New Democratic Party (occupying the left[182][183]); the Bloc Québécois; and the Green Party of Canada.[184] Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.[185][186][187]\n\n\nCanada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy—the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[188][189][190][191] The reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other Commonwealth countries (though, all are sovereign of one another[192]) and each of Canada's 10 provinces. To carry out most of their federal royal duties in Canada, the monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister.[193][194]\n\n\n\n![King Charles III](image)\nCharles III, King of Canada\n![Governor General Mary Simon](image)\nMary Simon, Governor General of Canada\n![Prime Minister Justin Trudeau](image)\nJustin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada\n\nThe monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada.[191][195][196] However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in certain rare crisis situations,[195] the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative) is otherwise always directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister,[197] the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House of Commons.[198] The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies.[195] The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.[199]\n\n\n\n![The House of Commons chamber](image)The House of Commons in its temporary location, the West Block[200]\nThe Parliament of Canada passes all statute laws within the federal sphere. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the Senate. While Canada inherited the British concept of parliamentary supremacy, this was later, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law.[201]\n\n\nEach of the 338 members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The *Constitution Act, 1982*, requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the *Canada Elections Act* limits this to four years with a \"fixed\" election date in October; general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in the House.[202][203] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.[204]\n\n\nCanadian federalism divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons.[196] Canada's three territories also have legislatures; but, these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.[205] The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.[206]\n\n\nThe Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country.[207] The minister of finance and minister of innovation, science, and industry use the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development.[208] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes.[209] The bank does not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.[210]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Canada\n\nThe Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions.[211] The *Constitution Act, 1867* (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments.[212] The *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, granted full autonomy, and the *Constitution Act, 1982*, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.[213] The *Charter* guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government; though, a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the *Charter* for a period of five years.[214]\n\n\n\n![Supreme Court of Canada building](image)The Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill\nCanada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since December 18, 2017, by Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of Canada.[215] The governor general appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice.[216] The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.[217]\n\n\nCommon law prevails everywhere, except in Quebec, where civil law predominates.[218] Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.[219] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.[220] In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police.[221]\n\n\nCanadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada.[222] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples.[223] Most notably, a series of 11 treaties, known as the Numbered Treaties, were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.[224] These treaties are agreements between the Canadian Crown-in-Council, with the duty to consult and accommodate.[225] The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.[223] These rights may include provision of services, such as healthcare through the Indian Health Transfer Policy, and exemption from taxation.[226]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations and military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of Canada, Canadian Armed Forces, and Military history of Canada\n\n![Canadian Delegation to the United Nations seated around conference table](image)The Canadian delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization, San Francisco, May 1945[227]\nCanada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions.[228] Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions, international organizations, and the work of numerous federal institutions.[229][230] Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image.[231][232] The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.[233]\n\n\nCanada and the United States have a long, complex, and intertwined relationship;[234][235] they are close allies, co-operating regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts.[236][237] Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France,[238] along with both countries' former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie*.[239] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.[98] Canada was a founding member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, the G20, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[228] Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs.[240] Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976.[241] The country joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001.[242] Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).[243]\n\n\nCanada's earlier strong attachment to the British Empire and, later, the Commonwealth, led it to make significant contributions to British military efforts in the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the First World War (1914–1918), and the Second World War (1939–1945).[244] Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.[245][246] During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), in cooperation with the United States, to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.[247]\n\n\n\n![A fighter jet taking off from a runway](image)A Canadian McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet in \"special markings\" used by the 2014 CF-18 Demonstration Team[248]\nDuring the Suez Crisis of 1956, future prime minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.[249] As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.[250] Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989,[91] and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere. Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia affair.[251]\n\n\nIn 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the US stabilization force and the UN-authorized, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.[252] In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925.[253]\n\n\nThe unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\"[254]—with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers.[255][c] In 2021, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.4 billion, or around 1.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).[257] Canada's total military expenditure is expected to reach $32.7 billion by 2027.[258] Canada's military currently has over 3000 personnel deployed overseas in multiple operations, such as Operation Snowgoose in Cyprus, Operation Unifier supporting Ukraine, Operation Caribbe in the Caribbean Sea, and Operation Impact, a coalition for the military intervention against ISIL.[259]\n\n\n\n### Provinces and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Provinces and territories of Canada\n\nSee also: Canadian federalism\n\n![Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces and territories](image)Political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories[260]\nCanada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories. In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (*Eastern Canada* refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[261] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and welfare,[262] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[263]\n\n\nThe major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown[264] and power and authority from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada[265] and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council,[266] rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively[267] and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment, while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.[268]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Canada\n\n![](image)The Toronto financial district is the second-largest financial centre in North America, the seventh-largest globally in employment and the heart of Canada's finance industry.[269]\nCanada has a highly developed mixed-market economy,[270][271] with the world's ninth-largest economy as of 2023[update], and a nominal GDP of approximately US$2.221 trillion.[272] It is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy.[273] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion.[274] Canada's exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States.[274] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion.[274] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion.[275]\n\n\nCanada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions.[276] It ranks low in the Corruption Perceptions Index (14th in 2023)[277] and \"is widely regarded as among the least corrupt countries of the world\".[278] It ranks high in the Global Competitiveness Report (14th in 2019)[279] and Global Innovation Index (15th in 2023).[280] Canada's economy ranks above most Western nations on The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom[281] and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity.[282] The country's average household disposable income per capita is \"well above\" the OECD average.[283] Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability[284][285] and foreign direct investment.[286][285]\n\n\nSince the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one.[287] Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce.[288] Among developed countries, Canada has an unusually important primary sector, of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent components.[289] Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby mines or sources of timber.[290]\n\n\n\n![](image)Canada\nCountries and territories with free-trade agreements[291]\n\nCanada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II.[292] The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry.[293] The Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994 (later replaced by the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement).[294] As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade agreements with 51 different countries.[291]\n\n\nCanada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.[289][295] Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas,[296] and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world.[297] The vast Athabasca oil sands and other oil reserves give Canada 13 percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world's third or fourth-largest.[298] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains.[299] The country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium.[300][301] Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.[302] The fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy.[303]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Canada\n\nIn 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9 billion on domestic research and development, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion.[304] As of 2023[update], the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine.[305] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index,[306] and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms.[307] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population.[308]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Canadian-built Space Shuttle robotic arm (left), referred to as Canadarm, transferred the P5 truss segment over to the Canadian-built space station robotic arm, referred to as Canadarm2.[309]\nCanada's developments in science and technology include the creation of the modern alkaline battery,[310] the discovery of insulin,[311] the development of the polio vaccine,[312] and discoveries about the interior structure of the atomic nucleus.[313] Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial cardiac pacemaker, mapping the visual cortex,[314][315] the development of the electron microscope,[316][317] plate tectonics, deep learning, multi-touch technology, and the identification of the first black hole, Cygnus X-1.[318] Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include stem cells, site-directed mutagenesis, T-cell receptor, and the identification of the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases.[315][319]\n\n\nThe Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research and developing rockets and satellites.[320] Canada was the third country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch.[321] Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2, Canadarm3 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle.[322] Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS, and MOST.[323] Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant.[324]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Canada and List of cities in Canada\n\n![](image)Canada population density map (2014)[325]\nThe 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure.[326] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023.[327] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.[328] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[329] driven mainly by economic policy and also family reunification.[330][331] A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted to Canada in 2021.[332] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 28,000 in 2018.[333] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas in the country, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[334]\n\n\nCanada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world.[326] Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north and approximately 95 percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north.[335] About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the border with the contiguous United States.[336] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living urban centres.[337] The most densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[338][335]\n\n\nThe majority of Canadians (81.1 percent) live in family households, 12.1 percent report living alone, and those living with other relatives or unrelated persons reported at 6.8 percent.[339] Fifty-one percent of households are couples with or without children, 8.7 percent are single-parent households, 2.9 percent are multigenerational households, and 29.3 percent are single-person households.[339]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in Canada2021 Canadian census[340]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |\n| 1 | Toronto | Ontario | 6,202,225 | 11 | London | Ontario | 543,551\n |\n| 2 | Montreal | Quebec | 4,291,732 | 12 | Halifax | Nova Scotia | 465,703\n |\n| 3 | Vancouver | British Columbia | 2,642,825 | 13 | Niagara Region | Ontario | 433,604\n |\n| 4 | Ottawa–Gatineau | Ontario–Quebec | 1,488,307 | 14 | Windsor | Ontario | 422,630\n |\n| 5 | Calgary | Alberta | 1,481,806 | 15 | Oshawa | Ontario | 415,311\n |\n| 6 | Edmonton | Alberta | 1,418,118 | 16 | Victoria | British Columbia | 397,237\n |\n| 7 | Quebec City | Quebec | 839,311 | 17 | Saskatoon | Saskatchewan | 317,480\n |\n| 8 | Winnipeg | Manitoba | 834,678 | 18 | Regina | Saskatchewan | 249,217\n |\n| 9 | Hamilton | Ontario | 785,184 | 19 | Sherbrooke | Quebec | 227,398\n |\n| 10 | Waterloo Region | Ontario | 575,847 | 20 | Kelowna | British Columbia | 222,162\n |\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic origins of people in Canada\n\nAccording to the 2021 Canadian census, over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\" were self-reported by Canadians.[341] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5 percent), North American (22.9 percent), Asian (19.3 percent), North American Indigenous (6.1 percent), African (3.8 percent), Latin, Central and South American (2.5 percent), Caribbean (2.1 percent), Oceanian (0.3 percent), and other (6 percent).[341][342] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent of Canadians reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent.[341]\n\n\n\n![](image)The top 168 ethnic or cultural origins self-reported by Canadians in the 2021 census[343]\nThe country's ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian[d] (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent).[347]\n\n\nOf the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021, approximately 25.4 million reported being \"White\", representing 69.8 percent of the population.[348] The Indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million individuals, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021.[348] One out of every four Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority,[349][e] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1 percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7 percent), and Black (1.5 million; 4.3 percent).[351]\n\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent.[352] In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups.[353] The 2021 census indicated that 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0 percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent.[354] In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada.[355]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Canada\n\n![Map of Canada with English speakers and French speakers at a percentage](image)Approximately 98 percent of Canadians can speak either or both English and French:[356]English – 57%\nEnglish and French – 16%\nFrench – 21%\nSparsely populated area ( < 0.4 persons per km2)\n\nA multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively.[339] As of the 2021 census, just over 7.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890).[339] Canada's federal government practises official bilingualism, which is applied by the commissioner of official languages in consonance with section 16 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* and the federal *Official Languages Act*. English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.[357]\n\n\nThe 1977 *Charter of the French Language* established French as the official language of Quebec.[358] Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec.[359] New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population.[360] There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island.[361]\n\n\nOther provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.[362] There are 11 Indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.[363] Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.[364] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory.[365]\n\n\nAdditionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, some of which are Indigenous.[366] American Sign Language (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools.[367] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec.[368]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Canada\n\n![](image)Freedom of religion sculpture by Marlene Hilton Moore at the McMurtry Gardens of Justice in Toronto[369]\nCanada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs.[370] The Constitution of Canada refers to God and the monarch carries the title of *Defender of the Faith*; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism.[371] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.[372]\n\n\nRates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s.[370] With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,[373] Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state.[374][375][376] Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives,[377] they still believe in God.[378] The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter throughout Canadian society and by the state.[379]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Roman Catholics representing 29.9 percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing 53.3 percent of the population,[f] are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6 percent.[382] Other faiths include Islam (4.9 percent), Hinduism (2.3 percent), Sikhism (2.1 percent), Buddhism (1.0 percent), Judaism (0.9 percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2 percent).[383] Canada has the second-largest national Sikh population, behind India.[384]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Canada\n\nHealthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare.[385][386] It is guided by the provisions of the *Canada Health Act* of 1984[387] and is universal.[388] Universal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country.\"[389] Around 30 percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector.[390] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry.[390] Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs.[391][390]\n\n\n\n![graph of expenditures as described in the caption](image)Health expenditure and financing by country. Total health expenditure per capita in US dollars (PPP).\nIn common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years.[339] Life expectancy is 81.1 years.[392] A 2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88 percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they \"had good or very good health\".[393] Eighty percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use.[394] Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among OECD countries, contributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of diabetes.[394] Four chronic diseases—cancer (leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes—account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada.[395][396]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that healthcare spending reached $308 billion, or 12.7 percent of Canada's GDP for that year.[397] In 2022, Canada's per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the OECD.[398] Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources.[399][400] The Commonwealth Fund's 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last.[401] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage.[401] An increasing problem in Canada's health system is a lack of healthcare professionals.[402]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Canada and Higher education in Canada\n\n![The University of Toronto campus](image)University College, seen through the main gate and up King's College Road, at Canada's largest post-secondary institution, the University of Toronto\nEducation in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments.[403] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and the curriculum is overseen by the province.[404][405] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary education and post-secondary. Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada.[406] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded.[407] Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada.[408] The largest university is the University of Toronto with over 85,000 students.[409] Four universities are regularly ranked among the top 100 world-wide, namely University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, McGill University, and McMaster University, with a total of 18 universities ranked in the top 500 worldwide.[410]\n\n\nAccording to a 2019 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world;[411] the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree.[411] Canada spends about 5.3 percent of its GDP on education.[412] The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student).[413] As of 2014[update], 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.[414]\n\n\nThe mandatory education age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years,[415] contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent.[416] Just over 60,000 children are homeschooled in the country as of 2016. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading,[417][418] ranking the overall knowledge and skills of Canadian 15-year-olds as the sixth-best in the world, although these scores have been declining in recent years. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, with the average student scoring 523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493 in 2015.[419][420]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Canada\n\n![](image)*Monument to Multiculturalism* by Francesco Pirelli, in Toronto\nCanada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities and policies that promote a \"just society\" are constitutionally protected.[421][422][423] Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized equality and inclusiveness for all its people.[424][425][426] The official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments[427] and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity.[428][429] In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture.[430]\n\n\nCanada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support.[431] Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy termination) and LGBT rights, and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.[432][433][434] Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the national park system, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[435][436]\n\n\nHistorically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art, and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity.[437] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.[438]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: National symbols of Canada and Canadian royal symbols\n\n![The mother beaver sculpture outside the House of Commons](image)*The mother beaver* on the Canadian parliament's Peace Tower.[439] The five flowers on the shield each represent an ethnicity—Tudor rose: English; Fleur de lis: French; thistle: Scottish; shamrock: Irish; and leek: Welsh.\nThemes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism.[440] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, cold climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols.[441] The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the Arms of Canada.[442] Canada's official tartan, known as the \"maple leaf tartan\", has four colours that reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the seasons—green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling.[443] The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.[444]\n\n\nOther prominent symbols include the national motto, \"*A mari usque ad mare*\" (\"From Sea to Sea\"),[445] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse, the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, Canadian horse, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies,[442] and, more recently, the totem pole and Inuksuk.[446] Canadian beer, maple syrup, tuques, canoes, nanaimo bars, butter tarts, and poutine are defined as uniquely Canadian.[446][447] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, and the beaver on the nickel.[448] An image of the previous monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, appears on $20 bank notes and the obverse of all current Canadian coins.[448]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canadian literature\n\nCanadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[449] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration.[450] This progressed into three major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality.[451] In recent decades, Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from around the world.[452] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best.[453]\n\n\nNumerous Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards,[454] including novelist, poet, and literary critic Margaret Atwood, who received two Booker Prizes;[455] Nobel laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English;[456] and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who wrote the novel *The English Patient*, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.[457] L. M. Montgomery produced a series of children's novels beginning in 1908 with *Anne of Green Gables*.[458]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Canada\n\n![](image)A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) satellite truck, used for live television broadcasts\nCanada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized.[459][460] The *Broadcasting Act* declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada\".[461] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.[462] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).[463]\n\n\nCanadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a \"handful of corporations\".[464] The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French.[465] In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec.[466]\n\n\nNon-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.[467] In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing.[468] Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.[469]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canadian art\n\n![Oil on canvas painting of a tree dominating its rocky landscape during a sunset](image)*The Jack Pine* by Tom Thomson. Oil on canvas, 1916, in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada.[470]\nArt in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its Indigenous peoples,[471] and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism.[472] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.[473]\n\n\nThe Canadian government has played a role in the development of Canadian culture through the department of Canadian Heritage, by giving grants to art galleries,[474] as well as establishing and funding art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada Council for the Arts, the national public arts funder, helping artists, art galleries and periodicals, and thus contributing to the development of Canada's cultural works.[475]\n\n\nCanadian visual art has been dominated by figures, such as painter Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven.[476] The latter were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston and commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the group in 1926.[477] Associated with the group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast.[478]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Canada\n\n![](image)Original publication of \"O Canada\", 1908\nCanadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes.[479] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, and television music video channels.[480] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music.[481] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world,[482] producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles.[483] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.[484] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards.[485] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.[486]\n\n\nPatriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years. The earliest work of patriotic music in Canada, \"The Bold Canadian\", was written in 1812.[487] \"The Maple Leaf Forever\", written in 1866, was a popular patriotic song throughout English Canada and, for many years, served as an unofficial national anthem.[488] \"O Canada\" was adopted as the official anthem in 1980.[489] Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906.[490]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Canada\n\n![](image)The Canadian men's national ice hockey team celebrates shortly after winning the gold medal final at the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nThe roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s,[491] culminating in the development and popularization of the major professional games of ice hockey, lacrosse, curling, basketball, baseball, soccer, and Canadian football.[492] Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse.[493] Other sports such as golf, volleyball, skiing, cycling, swimming, badminton, tennis, bowling, and the study of martial arts are all widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.[494] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.[495] There are numerous other sport \"halls of fame\" in Canada, such as the Hockey Hall of Fame.[495]\n\n\nCanada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States.[496] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, as well as three Major League Soccer teams and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional competitions include the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League, the Canadian Premier League, and the various curling tournaments sanctioned and organized by Curling Canada.[497]\n\n\nCanada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics[498]—though, particularly, the Winter Games as a \"winter sports nation\"—and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events such as the 1976 Summer Olympics,[499] the 1988 Winter Olympics,[500] the 2010 Winter Olympics,[501][502] and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[503] Most recently, Canada hosted the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto.[504] The country is scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and the United States.[505]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Canada portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Index of Canada-related articles\n* List of Canada-related topics by provinces and territories\n* Outline of Canada\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 6,416 km (3,987 mi) via the contiguous 48 states and 2,475 km (1,538 mi) via Alaska[133]\n2. **^** \"Brokerage politics: A Canadian term for successful big tent parties that embody a pluralistic catch-all approach to appeal to the median Canadian voter ... adopting centrist policies and electoral coalitions to satisfy the short-term preferences of a majority of electors who are not located on the ideological fringe.\"[173][174] \"The traditional *brokerage* model of Canadian politics leaves little room for ideology.\"[175][176][177][178]\n3. **^**  \"The Royal Canadian Navy is composed of approximately 8,400 full-time sailors and 5,100 part-time sailors.

It is in the northwest Pacific Ocean and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 14,125 islands, with the five main islands being Hokkaido, Honshu (the \"mainland\"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.\n\n\nJapan has over 125 million inhabitants and is the 11th most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its highly urbanized population on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Japan has the world's highest life expectancy, though it is experiencing a population decline due to its very low birth rate.\n\n\nJapan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC). Between the fourth and ninth centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and the imperial court based in Heian-kyō. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (*shōgun*) and feudal lords (*daimyō*), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (*samurai*). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-modeled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. Amidst a rise in militarism and overseas colonization, Japan invaded China in 1937 and entered World War II as an Axis power in 1941. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution.\n\n\nUnder the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. Japan is a developed country and a great power, with one of the largest economies by nominal GDP. Japan has renounced its right to declare war, though it maintains a Self-Defense Force that ranks as one of the world's strongest militaries. A global leader in the automotive, robotics, and electronics industries, the country has made significant contributions to science and technology, and is one of the world's largest exporters and importers. It is part of multiple major international and intergovernmental institutions.\n\n\nJapan is considered a cultural superpower as the culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, film, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent manga, anime, and video game industries.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Japan\n\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji 日本 and is pronounced *Nippon* or *Nihon*.[12] Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as *Wa* (倭, changed in Japan around 757 to 和) and in Japan by the endonym *Yamato*.[13] *Nippon*, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on Japanese banknotes and postage stamps.[12] *Nihon* is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period.[13] The characters 日本 mean \"sun origin\",[12] which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".[14]\n\n\nThe name \"Japan\" is based on Chinese pronunciations of 日本 and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters 日本國 as *Cipangu*.[15] The old Malay name for Japan, *Japang* or *Japun*, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.[16] The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as *Giapan* in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Japan\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Japanese history.\n\n### Prehistoric to classical history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Legendary Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇, *Jinmu-tennō*)\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan.[19] This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.[20] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery.[21] From around 700 BC, the Japonic-speaking Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula,[22][23][24] intermingling with the Jōmon;[24] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming,[25] a new style of pottery,[26] and metallurgy from China and Korea.[27] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.[28]\n\n\nJapan first appears in written history in the Chinese *Book of Han*, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[29] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Shōtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).[30]\n\n\nIn 645, the government led by Prince Naka no Ōe and Fujiwara no Kamatari devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China.[31] It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[32] The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of China. Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn about Chinese writing, politics, art, and religion.[31] The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince Ōama and his nephew Prince Ōtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[33] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taihō Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments.[32] These legal reforms created the *ritsuryō* state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[33]\n\n\nThe Nara period (710–784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the *Kojiki* (712) and *Nihon Shoki* (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture.[34][35] A smallpox epidemic in 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[35][36] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyoto) in 794.[35] This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's *The Tale of Genji* and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem *\"Kimigayo\"* were written during this time.[37]\n\n\n\n### Feudal era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japanese samurai boarding a Mongol vessel during the Mongol invasions of Japan, depicted in the *Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba*, 1293\n![](image)Three unifiers of Japan. Left to right: Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai.[38] In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan by the Minamoto clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura.[39] After Yoritomo's death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the *shōgun*.[35] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class.[40] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo.[35] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336–1573).[41] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (*daimyō*) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").[42]\n\n\nDuring the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.[35][43] Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other *daimyō*;[44] his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi–Momoyama period.[45] After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.[35]\n\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support.[46] When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed *shōgun* by Emperor Go-Yōzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo).[47] The shogunate enacted measures including *buke shohatto*, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous *daimyō*,[48] and in 1639 the isolationist *sakoku* (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603–1868).[47][49] Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.[50] The study of Western sciences (*rangaku*) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki.[47] The Edo period gave rise to *kokugaku* (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.[51]\n\n\n\n### Modern era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nEmperor Meiji (明治天皇, *Meiji-tennō*); 1852–1912\n![](image)\nThe Japanese Empire in 1942\n\nThe United States Navy sent Commodore Matthew C. Perry to force the opening of Japan to the outside world. Arriving at Uraga with four \"Black Ships\" in July 1853, the Perry Expedition resulted in the March 1854 Convention of Kanagawa.[47] Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises.[47] The resignation of the *shōgun* led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration).[52] Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution (November 29, 1890), and assembled the Imperial Diet.[53] During the Meiji period (1868–1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.[54][55][56] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin.[57][53] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.[58][59]\n\n\nThe early 20th century saw a period of Taishō democracy (1912–1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization.[60][61] World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China.[61] The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups.[59][62][63] This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning several radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later.[64] In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Japan's imperial ambitions ended on September 2, 1945, with the country's surrender to the Allies.\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).[65] In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.[59][66] On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific.[67] Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery.[68] After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender.[69] The war cost Japan its colonies and millions of lives.[59] The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese Empire and its influence over the territories it conquered.[70][71] The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.[71]\n\n\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices.[71] The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952,[72] and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956.[71] A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world;[71] this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\".[73] In 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[74] On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the *Reiwa* era.[75]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Japan and Geology of Japan\n\n![](image)A topographic map of Japan\nJapan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia.[76] It stretches over 3000 km (1900 mi) northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.[77][78] The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa.[79] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.[80] As of 2019[update], Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi).[4] Japan has the sixth-longest coastline in the world at 29,751 km (18,486 mi). Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the eighth-largest exclusive economic zone in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).[81][82]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago is 67% forests and 14% agricultural.[83] The primarily rugged and mountainous terrain is restricted for habitation.[84] Thus the habitable zones, mainly in the coastal areas, have very high population densities: Japan is the 40th most densely populated country.[85][86] Honshu has the highest population density at 450 persons/km2 (1200/sq mi) as of 2010[update], while Hokkaido has the lowest density of 64.5 persons/km2 as of 2016[update].[87] As of 2014[update], approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (*umetatechi*).[88] Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and the country's largest freshwater lake.[89]\n\n\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic eruptions because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[90] It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index.[91] Japan has 111 active volcanoes.[92] Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century;[93] the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.[94] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.[74]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Japan § Climate\n\n![](image)Mount Fuji in Spring, view from Arakurayama Sengen Park\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.[95]\n\n\nIn the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn.[96] The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.[95]\n\n\nThe Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.[95] The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.[97] According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.[98] The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1 °C (106.0 °F), was recorded on July 23, 2018,[99] and repeated on August 17, 2020.[100]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Japan\n\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.[101] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019[update],[102] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.[103]\n\n\nA large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 52 Ramsar wetland sites.[104][105] Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.[106]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Japan and Climate change in Japan\n\n![](image)Autumn maple leaves (*momiji*) at Kongōbu-ji on Mount Kōya, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concerns, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970.[107] The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.[108]\n\n\nJapan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.[109] Japan is the world's fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide.[98] As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.[110] In 2020 the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050.[111] Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.[112]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Emperor of Japan, Government of Japan, Politics of Japan, and Law of Japan\n\n![](image)Emperor Naruhito, current head of state, and Empress Masako participated in the Imperial Procession by motorcar after the Ceremony of the Enthronement in Tokyo on November 10, 2019.\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role.[113] Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.[114] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)The National Diet Building\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament.[113] It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms.[115] There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age,[116] with a secret ballot for all elected offices.[114] The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet.[115] Fumio Kishida is Japan's prime minister; he took office after winning the 2021 Liberal Democratic Party leadership election.[117] The right-wing big tent Liberal Democratic Party has been the dominant party in the country since the 1950s, often called the 1955 System.[118]\n\n\nHistorically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as *Kujikata Osadamegaki*.[119] Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post–World War II modifications.[120] The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world.[121] Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[119] Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.[122]\n\n\nAccording to data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the majority of members of the Japanese parliament are male and range in age from 50 to 70. In April 2023, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, Ryosuke Takashima, 26, is Japan's youngest-ever mayor.[123]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Administrative divisions of Japan and Prefectures of Japan\n\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature.[113] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:[124]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Prefectures of Japan with colored regions | **Hokkaido**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1. Hokkaido\n | **Tōhoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n2. Aomori\n3. Iwate\n4. Miyagi\n5. Akita\n6. Yamagata\n7. Fukushima\n | **Kantō**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n8. Ibaraki\n9. Tochigi\n10. Gunma\n11. Saitama\n12. Chiba\n13. Tokyo\n14. Kanagawa\n | **Chūbu**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15. Niigata\n16. Toyama\n17. Ishikawa\n18. Fukui\n19. Yamanashi\n20. Nagano\n21. Gifu\n22. Shizuoka\n23. Aichi\n |\n| **Kansai**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n24. Mie\n25. Shiga\n26. Kyoto\n27. Osaka\n28. Hyōgo\n29. Nara\n30. Wakayama\n | **Chūgoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n31. Tottori\n32. Shimane\n33. Okayama\n34. Hiroshima\n35. Yamaguchi\n | **Shikoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n36. Tokushima\n37. Kagawa\n38. Ehime\n39. Kōchi\n | **Kyūshū**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n40. Fukuoka\n41. Saga\n42. Nagasaki\n43. Kumamoto\n44. Ōita\n45. Miyazaki\n46. Kagoshima\n47. Okinawa\n |\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Japan\n\n![](image)Japan is a member of both the G7 and the G20.\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 nations seeking reform of the Security Council.[125] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit.[126] It is the world's fifth-largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.[127] In 2021, Japan had the fourth-largest diplomatic network in the world.[128]\n\n\nJapan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance.[129] The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan.[129] Japan is also a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (more commonly \"the Quad\"), a multilateral security dialogue reformed in 2017 aiming to limit Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region, along with the United States, Australia, and India, reflecting existing relations and patterns of cooperation.[130][131]\n\n\nJapan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[132] South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan.[133] Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.[134]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japan Self-Defense Forces\n\n![](image)JMSDF *Kongō* class destroyer\nJapan is the second-highest-ranked Asian country in the 2022 Global Peace Index, after Singapore.[135] It spent 1% of its total GDP on its defence budget in 2020,[136] and maintained the tenth-largest military budget in the world in 2022.[137] The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.[138] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.[139]\n\n\nThe Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines.[140] In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.[141] In December 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida further confirmed this trend, instructing the government to increase spending by 65% until 2027.[142] Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.[143][144]\n\n\n\n### Domestic law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in Japan and Crime in Japan\n\n![](image)The headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency.[145] As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission.[146] The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.[147] The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.[148]\n\n\nThe Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords, and other weaponry.[149][150] According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018[update], the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence, and robbery are very low in Japan.[151][152][153][154]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Japan and LGBT rights in Japan\n\nJapan has faced criticism for not allowing same-sex marriages, despite a majority of Japanese people supporting marriage equality.[155] It is considered to be the least developed out of the G7 nations in terms of LGBT equality.[156][157] Japan does not explicitly legally ban racial or religious discrimination.[158]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Japan\n\n![](image)Skyscrapers in Nakanoshima, Osaka; a major financial center in Japan\nJapan has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States, China and Germany; and the fourth-largest economy by PPP.[159] As of 2021[update], Japan's labor force is the world's eighth-largest, consisting of over 68.6 million workers.[81] As of 2022[update], Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.6%.[160] Its poverty rate is the second highest among the G7 nations,[161] and exceeds 15.7% of the population.[162] Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies,[163] with national debt estimated at 248% relative to GDP as of 2022[update].[164] The Japanese yen is the world's third-largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro.[165]\n\n\nJapan was the world's fifth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer in 2022.[166][167] Its exports amounted to 18.2% of its total GDP in 2021.[168] As of 2022[update], Japan's main export markets were China (23.9 percent, including Hong Kong) and the United States (18.5 percent).[169] Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors, and auto parts.[81] Japan's main import markets as of 2022[update] were China (21.1 percent), the United States (9.9 percent), and Australia (9.8 percent).[169] Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.[169]\n\n\nThe Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment.[170][171] Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the world's ten largest cooperatives, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative as of 2018[update].[172] It ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. Japan ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019.[173] It attracted 31.9 million international tourists in 2019,[174] and was ranked eleventh in the world in 2019 for inbound tourism.[175] The 2021 *Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report* ranked Japan first in the world out of 117 countries.[176] Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $46.1 billion.[175]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture and fishery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan\n\n![](image)A rice paddy in Aizu, Fukushima Prefecture\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the total country's GDP as of 2018[update].[115] Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.[177] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.[178] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018[update].[179] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected.[180] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.[181]\n\n\nJapan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade.[182] Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch,[81] prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.[183] Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.[184]\n\n\n\n### Industry and services[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Manufacturing in Japan, Trade and services in Japan, Electronics industry in Japan, and Automotive industry in Japan\n\n![](image)A hybrid car manufactured by Toyota.

The country ranked 13th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[195] Relative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world,[196] with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017[update].[197] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,[198] and three Fields medalists.[199]\n\n\nJapan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 45% of the world's 2020 total;[200] down from 55% in 2017.[201] Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees.[202]\n\n\nOnce considered the strongest in the world, the Japanese consumer electronics industry is in a state of decline as regional competition arises in neighboring East Asian countries such as South Korea and China.[203] However, Japan's video game sector remains a major industry. In 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.[204] By 2015, Japan had become the world's fourth-largest PC game market, behind only China, the United States, and South Korea.[205]\n\n\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites.[206] It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibō) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.[207] The space probe *Akatsuki* was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015.[208] Japan's plans in space exploration include building a Moon base and landing astronauts by 2030.[209] In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the Moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007,[210][211] and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.[212]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Japan\n\n![](image)Japan Airlines, the flag carrier of Japan\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure.[213] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017[update].[214]\n\n\nSince privatization in 1987,[215] dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.[216]\n\n\nThere are 175 airports in Japan as of 2013[update].[81] The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second-busiest airport in 2019.[217] The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively as of 2017[update].[218]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Japan\n\n![](image)Part of the Seto Hill Windfarm\nAs of 2019[update], 37.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25.1% from coal, 22.4% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 2.8% from nuclear power, among other sources. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010.[219] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service.[220] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015,[221] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted.[222] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy.[223] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[224]\n\n\n\n### Water supply and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in Japan\n\nResponsibility for the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment, in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.[225] Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. About 98% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities.[226]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Japan, Japanese people, Ethnic groups of Japan, List of metropolitan areas in Japan, and List of cities in Japan\n\n![](image)View of Tokyo from the top of the Tokyo Skytree. The Greater Tokyo Area is ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\nJapan has a population of almost 125 million, of which nearly 122 million are Japanese nationals (2022 estimates).[227] A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder.[228] \nJapan is the world's fastest aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one-third of its total population;[229] this is the result of a post–World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates.[230] Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.4, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world's lowest;[231] it has a median age of 48.4, the highest in the world.[232] As of 2020[update], over 28.7 percent of the population is over 65, or more than one in four out of the Japanese population.[229] As a growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remaining childless,[233][234] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 88 million by 2065.[229]\n\n\nThe changes in demographic structure have created several social issues, particularly a decline in the workforce population and an increase in the cost of social security benefits.[233] The Government of Japan projects that there will be almost one elderly person for each person of working age by 2060.[232] Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.[235][236] On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.[237]\n\n\nIn 2019, 92% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.[238] The capital city, Tokyo, has a population of 13.9 million (2022).[239] It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).[240] Japan is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society,[241] with the Japanese people forming 98.1% of the country's population.[242] Minority ethnic groups in the country include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people.[243] Zainichi Koreans,[244] Chinese,[245] Filipinos,[246] Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[247] and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are also among Japan's small minority groups.[248] *Burakumin* make up a social minority group.[249]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in Japan2015 Census\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | Prefecture | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Prefecture | Pop. |\n| 1 | Tokyo | Tokyo | 9,272,740 | 11 | Hiroshima | Hiroshima | 1,194,034\n |\n| 2 | Yokohama | Kanagawa | 3,724,844 | 12 | Sendai | Miyagi | 1,082,159\n |\n| 3 | Osaka | Osaka | 2,691,185 | 13 | Chiba | Chiba | 971,882\n |\n| 4 | Nagoya | Aichi | 2,295,638 | 14 | Kitakyushu | Fukuoka | 961,286\n |\n| 5 | Sapporo | Hokkaido | 1,952,356 | 15 | Sakai | Osaka | 839,310\n |\n| 6 | Fukuoka | Fukuoka | 1,538,681 | 16 | Niigata | Niigata | 810,157\n |\n| 7 | Kobe | Hyōgo | 1,537,272 | 17 | Hamamatsu | Shizuoka | 797,980\n |\n| 8 | Kawasaki | Kanagawa | 1,475,213 | 18 | Kumamoto | Kumamoto | 740,822\n |\n| 9 | Kyoto | Kyoto | 1,475,183 | 19 | Sagamihara | Kanagawa | 720,780\n |\n| 10 | Saitama | Saitama | 1,263,979 | 20 | Okayama | Okayama | 719,474\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Japan\n\n![](image)The torii of Itsukushima Shinto Shrine near Hiroshima\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom.[250] Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion.[251] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual.[252] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.[253] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.[31]\n\n\nChristianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, 1%[254] to 1.5% of the population are Christians.[255] Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.[256]\n\n\nAbout 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants as of 2016[update].[257] As of 2018[update] there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were Japanese nationals.[258] Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Baháʼí Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.[259]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Japan\n\n![](image)*Kanji* and *hiragana* signs\nThe Japanese language is Japan's *de facto* national language and the primary written and spoken language of most people in the country.[260] Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radicals used by kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.[261] English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language. As a result, the prevalence of English in the educational system has increased, with English classes becoming mandatory at all levels of the Japanese school system by 2020.[260] Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support.[260]\n\n\nBesides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.[262] Few children learn these languages,[263] but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.[264] The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014[update].[265] Additionally, a number of other languages are taught and used by ethnic minorities, immigrant communities, and a growing number of foreign-language students, such as Korean (including a distinct Zainichi Korean dialect), Chinese and Portuguese.[260]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Japan\n\n![](image)Students celebrating after the announcement of the results of the entrance examinations to the University of Tokyo\nSince the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years.[266] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.[267] The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.[268] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.[269]\n\n\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world.[270] Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 520 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.[271][270][272] It spent roughly 3.1% of its total GDP on education as of 2018[update],[273] below the OECD average of 4.9%.[274] In 2021, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25 to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 55.6%.[275] Approximately 65% of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, and bachelor's degrees are held by 34.2% of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.[275] In 2020, the share of women among tertiary programmes graduates was 51,8%.[275]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Japan and Health care system in Japan\n\n![](image)Fujita University Hospital is the largest multi-speciality teaching hospital in Japan.\nHealth care in Japan is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments.[276] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.[277]\n\n\nJapan spent 10.74% of its total GDP on healthcare in 2019.[278] In 2020, the overall life expectancy in Japan at birth was 84.62 years (81.64 years for males and 87.74 years for females), the highest in the world;[279] while it had a very low infant mortality rate (2 per 1,000 live births).[280] Since 1981, the principal cause of death in Japan is cancer, which accounted for 27% of the total deaths in 2018—followed by cardiovascular diseases, which led to 15% of the deaths.[281] Japan has one of the world's highest suicide rates, which is considered a major social issue.[282] Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men.[283] However, Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia among developed countries.[284]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Japan\n\nSee also: Japanese popular culture\n\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America.[285] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[286] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.[106] Japan is considered a cultural superpower.[287][288]\n\n\n\n### Art and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese art\n\nFurther information: Japanese architecture, Japanese garden, Japanese esthetics, Japanese painting, and Japanese sculpture\n\n![](image)\nHokusai's 19th-century ukiyo-e woodblock print *The Great Wave off Kanagawa*\n![](image)\nRitsurin Garden, one of the most famous strolling gardens in Japan\n\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.[289] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[289]\n\n\nJapanese architecture is a combination of local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.[290] The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.[291] Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.[292] Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design.[293] It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzō Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.[294]\n\n\n\n### Literature and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Japanese literature, Japanese poetry, and Japanese philosophy\n\n![](image)12th-century illustrated handscroll of *The Tale of Genji*, a National Treasure\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the *Kojiki* and *Nihon Shoki* chronicles and the *Man'yōshū* poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.[295][296] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as *kana* (hiragana and katakana) was developed.[297] *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative.[298] An account of court life is given in *The Pillow Book* by Sei Shōnagon, while *The Tale of Genji* by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.[299][300]\n\n\nDuring the Edo period, the chōnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bashō revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinshū with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue *Oku no Hosomichi*.[301] The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Kafū Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors – Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburō Ōe (1994).[302]\n\n\nJapanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.[303] Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.[304]\n\n\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Japan and Theatre of Japan\n\n![](image)*Noh* performance at a Shinto shrine\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century.[305] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture.[306] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America.[307] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop.[308] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.[309]\n\n\nThe four traditional theaters from Japan are *noh*, *kyōgen*, *kabuki*, and *bunraku*.[310] Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.[311]\n\n\n\n### Holidays[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Public holidays in Japan and Japanese festivals\n\n![](image)Young ladies celebrate Coming of Age Day (成人の日, *Seijin no Hi*) in Harajuku, Tokyo.\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (国民の祝日に関する法律, *Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru Hōritsu*) of 1948.[312] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.[313] The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Shōwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.[314]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese cuisine\n\n![](image)A plate of *nigiri-zushi*\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.[315] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.[316] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.[317][318] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as *wagashi*.[319] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes include green tea ice cream.[320]\n\n\nPopular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14–17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.[321] Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century.[322] Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.[323]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cinema of Japan, Manga, Anime, and Media of Japan\n\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.[324] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally;[325] other popular shows are in the genres of variety shows, comedy, and news programs.[326] Many Japanese media franchises have gained considerable global popularity and are among the world's highest-grossing media franchises. Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016[update].[327]\n\n\nJapan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally.[328] Ishirō Honda's *Godzilla* became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of *kaiju* films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history.[329][330] Japanese comics, known as manga, developed in the mid-20th century and have become popular worldwide.[331][332] A large number of manga series have become some of the best-selling comics series of all time, rivalling the American comics industry.[333] Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have become highly popular internationally.[334][335]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Japan\n\n![](image)Sumo wrestlers form around the referee during the ring-entering ceremony.\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.[336] Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum.[337] Baseball is the most popular sport in the country.[338] Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), was established in 1936.[339] Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League (J.League) in 1992, association football gained a wide following.[340] The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.[341] Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times,[342] and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.[343] Golf is also popular in Japan.[344]\n\n\nIn motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, and the World Rally Championship.[345][346][347] Drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans as well as podium finishes in Formula One, in addition to success in domestic championships.[348][349] Super GT is the most popular national racing series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top-level domestic open-wheel series.[350] The country hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix.[351]\n\n\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.[352] The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship[353] and will co-host the 2023 Basketball World Championship.[354] Tokyo hosted the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.[355] The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation.[356] Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country[357] and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.[358]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* Index of Japan-related articles\n* Outline of Japan\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** [ɲippoꜜɴ] ⓘ or [ɲihoꜜɴ] ⓘ\n2. **^** In English, the official name of the country is simply \"Japan\".[11] In Japanese, the name of the country as it appears on official documents, including the country's constitution, is 日本国 (*Nippon-koku*ⓘ or *Nihon-koku*), meaning \"State of Japan\".

It is in the northwest Pacific Ocean and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 14,125 islands, with the five main islands being Hokkaido, Honshu (the \"mainland\"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.\n\n\nJapan has over 125 million inhabitants and is the 11th most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its highly urbanized population on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Japan has the world's highest life expectancy, though it is experiencing a population decline due to its very low birth rate.\n\n\nJapan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC). Between the fourth and ninth centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and the imperial court based in Heian-kyō. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (*shōgun*) and feudal lords (*daimyō*), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (*samurai*). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-modeled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. Amidst a rise in militarism and overseas colonization, Japan invaded China in 1937 and entered World War II as an Axis power in 1941. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution.\n\n\nUnder the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. Japan is a developed country and a great power, with one of the largest economies by nominal GDP. Japan has renounced its right to declare war, though it maintains a Self-Defense Force that ranks as one of the world's strongest militaries. A global leader in the automotive, robotics, and electronics industries, the country has made significant contributions to science and technology, and is one of the world's largest exporters and importers. It is part of multiple major international and intergovernmental institutions.\n\n\nJapan is considered a cultural superpower as the culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, film, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent manga, anime, and video game industries.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Japan\n\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji 日本 and is pronounced *Nippon* or *Nihon*.[12] Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as *Wa* (倭, changed in Japan around 757 to 和) and in Japan by the endonym *Yamato*.[13] *Nippon*, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on Japanese banknotes and postage stamps.[12] *Nihon* is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period.[13] The characters 日本 mean \"sun origin\",[12] which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".[14]\n\n\nThe name \"Japan\" is based on Chinese pronunciations of 日本 and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters 日本國 as *Cipangu*.[15] The old Malay name for Japan, *Japang* or *Japun*, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.[16] The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as *Giapan* in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Japan\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Japanese history.\n\n### Prehistoric to classical history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Legendary Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇, *Jinmu-tennō*)\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan.[19] This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.[20] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery.[21] From around 700 BC, the Japonic-speaking Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula,[22][23][24] intermingling with the Jōmon;[24] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming,[25] a new style of pottery,[26] and metallurgy from China and Korea.[27] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.[28]\n\n\nJapan first appears in written history in the Chinese *Book of Han*, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[29] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Shōtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).[30]\n\n\nIn 645, the government led by Prince Naka no Ōe and Fujiwara no Kamatari devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China.[31] It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[32] The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of China. Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn about Chinese writing, politics, art, and religion.[31] The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince Ōama and his nephew Prince Ōtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[33] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taihō Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments.[32] These legal reforms created the *ritsuryō* state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[33]\n\n\nThe Nara period (710–784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the *Kojiki* (712) and *Nihon Shoki* (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture.[34][35] A smallpox epidemic in 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[35][36] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyoto) in 794.[35] This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's *The Tale of Genji* and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem *\"Kimigayo\"* were written during this time.[37]\n\n\n\n### Feudal era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japanese samurai boarding a Mongol vessel during the Mongol invasions of Japan, depicted in the *Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba*, 1293\n![](image)Three unifiers of Japan. Left to right: Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai.[38] In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan by the Minamoto clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura.[39] After Yoritomo's death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the *shōgun*.[35] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class.[40] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo.[35] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336–1573).[41] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (*daimyō*) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").[42]\n\n\nDuring the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.[35][43] Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other *daimyō*;[44] his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi–Momoyama period.[45] After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.[35]\n\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support.[46] When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed *shōgun* by Emperor Go-Yōzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo).[47] The shogunate enacted measures including *buke shohatto*, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous *daimyō*,[48] and in 1639 the isolationist *sakoku* (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603–1868).[47][49] Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.[50] The study of Western sciences (*rangaku*) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki.[47] The Edo period gave rise to *kokugaku* (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.[51]\n\n\n\n### Modern era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nEmperor Meiji (明治天皇, *Meiji-tennō*); 1852–1912\n![](image)\nThe Japanese Empire in 1942\n\nThe United States Navy sent Commodore Matthew C. Perry to force the opening of Japan to the outside world. Arriving at Uraga with four \"Black Ships\" in July 1853, the Perry Expedition resulted in the March 1854 Convention of Kanagawa.[47] Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises.[47] The resignation of the *shōgun* led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration).[52] Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution (November 29, 1890), and assembled the Imperial Diet.[53] During the Meiji period (1868–1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.[54][55][56] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin.[57][53] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.[58][59]\n\n\nThe early 20th century saw a period of Taishō democracy (1912–1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization.[60][61] World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China.[61] The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups.[59][62][63] This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning several radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later.[64] In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Japan's imperial ambitions ended on September 2, 1945, with the country's surrender to the Allies.\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).[65] In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.[59][66] On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific.[67] Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery.[68] After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender.[69] The war cost Japan its colonies and millions of lives.[59] The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese Empire and its influence over the territories it conquered.[70][71] The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.[71]\n\n\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices.[71] The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952,[72] and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956.[71] A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world;[71] this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\".[73] In 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[74] On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the *Reiwa* era.[75]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Japan and Geology of Japan\n\n![](image)A topographic map of Japan\nJapan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia.[76] It stretches over 3000 km (1900 mi) northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.[77][78] The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa.[79] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.[80] As of 2019[update], Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi).[4] Japan has the sixth-longest coastline in the world at 29,751 km (18,486 mi). Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the eighth-largest exclusive economic zone in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).[81][82]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago is 67% forests and 14% agricultural.[83] The primarily rugged and mountainous terrain is restricted for habitation.[84] Thus the habitable zones, mainly in the coastal areas, have very high population densities: Japan is the 40th most densely populated country.[85][86] Honshu has the highest population density at 450 persons/km2 (1200/sq mi) as of 2010[update], while Hokkaido has the lowest density of 64.5 persons/km2 as of 2016[update].[87] As of 2014[update], approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (*umetatechi*).[88] Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and the country's largest freshwater lake.[89]\n\n\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic eruptions because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[90] It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index.[91] Japan has 111 active volcanoes.[92] Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century;[93] the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.[94] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.[74]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Japan § Climate\n\n![](image)Mount Fuji in Spring, view from Arakurayama Sengen Park\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.[95]\n\n\nIn the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn.[96] The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.[95]\n\n\nThe Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.[95] The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.[97] According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.[98] The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1 °C (106.0 °F), was recorded on July 23, 2018,[99] and repeated on August 17, 2020.[100]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Japan\n\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.[101] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019[update],[102] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.[103]\n\n\nA large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 52 Ramsar wetland sites.[104][105] Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.[106]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Japan and Climate change in Japan\n\n![](image)Autumn maple leaves (*momiji*) at Kongōbu-ji on Mount Kōya, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concerns, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970.[107] The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.[108]\n\n\nJapan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.[109] Japan is the world's fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide.[98] As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.[110] In 2020 the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050.[111] Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.[112]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Emperor of Japan, Government of Japan, Politics of Japan, and Law of Japan\n\n![](image)Emperor Naruhito, current head of state, and Empress Masako participated in the Imperial Procession by motorcar after the Ceremony of the Enthronement in Tokyo on November 10, 2019.\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role.[113] Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.[114] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)The National Diet Building\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament.[113] It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms.[115] There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age,[116] with a secret ballot for all elected offices.[114] The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet.[115] Fumio Kishida is Japan's prime minister; he took office after winning the 2021 Liberal Democratic Party leadership election.[117] The right-wing big tent Liberal Democratic Party has been the dominant party in the country since the 1950s, often called the 1955 System.[118]\n\n\nHistorically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as *Kujikata Osadamegaki*.[119] Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post–World War II modifications.[120] The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world.[121] Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[119] Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.[122]\n\n\nAccording to data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the majority of members of the Japanese parliament are male and range in age from 50 to 70. In April 2023, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, Ryosuke Takashima, 26, is Japan's youngest-ever mayor.[123]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Administrative divisions of Japan and Prefectures of Japan\n\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature.[113] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:[124]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Prefectures of Japan with colored regions | **Hokkaido**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1. Hokkaido\n | **Tōhoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n2. Aomori\n3. Iwate\n4. Miyagi\n5. Akita\n6. Yamagata\n7. Fukushima\n | **Kantō**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n8. Ibaraki\n9. Tochigi\n10. Gunma\n11. Saitama\n12. Chiba\n13. Tokyo\n14. Kanagawa\n | **Chūbu**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15. Niigata\n16. Toyama\n17. Ishikawa\n18. Fukui\n19. Yamanashi\n20. Nagano\n21. Gifu\n22. Shizuoka\n23. Aichi\n |\n| **Kansai**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n24. Mie\n25. Shiga\n26. Kyoto\n27. Osaka\n28. Hyōgo\n29. Nara\n30. Wakayama\n | **Chūgoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n31. Tottori\n32. Shimane\n33. Okayama\n34. Hiroshima\n35. Yamaguchi\n | **Shikoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n36. Tokushima\n37. Kagawa\n38. Ehime\n39. Kōchi\n | **Kyūshū**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n40. Fukuoka\n41. Saga\n42. Nagasaki\n43. Kumamoto\n44. Ōita\n45. Miyazaki\n46. Kagoshima\n47. Okinawa\n |\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Japan\n\n![](image)Japan is a member of both the G7 and the G20.\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 nations seeking reform of the Security Council.[125] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit.[126] It is the world's fifth-largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.[127] In 2021, Japan had the fourth-largest diplomatic network in the world.[128]\n\n\nJapan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance.[129] The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan.[129] Japan is also a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (more commonly \"the Quad\"), a multilateral security dialogue reformed in 2017 aiming to limit Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region, along with the United States, Australia, and India, reflecting existing relations and patterns of cooperation.[130][131]\n\n\nJapan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[132] South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan.[133] Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.[134]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japan Self-Defense Forces\n\n![](image)JMSDF *Kongō* class destroyer\nJapan is the second-highest-ranked Asian country in the 2022 Global Peace Index, after Singapore.[135] It spent 1% of its total GDP on its defence budget in 2020,[136] and maintained the tenth-largest military budget in the world in 2022.[137] The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.[138] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.[139]\n\n\nThe Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines.[140] In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.[141] In December 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida further confirmed this trend, instructing the government to increase spending by 65% until 2027.[142] Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.[143][144]\n\n\n\n### Domestic law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in Japan and Crime in Japan\n\n![](image)The headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency.[145] As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission.[146] The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.[147] The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.[148]\n\n\nThe Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords, and other weaponry.[149][150] According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018[update], the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence, and robbery are very low in Japan.[151][152][153][154]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Japan and LGBT rights in Japan\n\nJapan has faced criticism for not allowing same-sex marriages, despite a majority of Japanese people supporting marriage equality.[155] It is considered to be the least developed out of the G7 nations in terms of LGBT equality.[156][157] Japan does not explicitly legally ban racial or religious discrimination.[158]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Japan\n\n![](image)Skyscrapers in Nakanoshima, Osaka; a major financial center in Japan\nJapan has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States, China and Germany; and the fourth-largest economy by PPP.[159] As of 2021[update], Japan's labor force is the world's eighth-largest, consisting of over 68.6 million workers.[81] As of 2022[update], Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.6%.[160] Its poverty rate is the second highest among the G7 nations,[161] and exceeds 15.7% of the population.[162] Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies,[163] with national debt estimated at 248% relative to GDP as of 2022[update].[164] The Japanese yen is the world's third-largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro.[165]\n\n\nJapan was the world's fifth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer in 2022.[166][167] Its exports amounted to 18.2% of its total GDP in 2021.[168] As of 2022[update], Japan's main export markets were China (23.9 percent, including Hong Kong) and the United States (18.5 percent).[169] Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors, and auto parts.[81] Japan's main import markets as of 2022[update] were China (21.1 percent), the United States (9.9 percent), and Australia (9.8 percent).[169] Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.[169]\n\n\nThe Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment.[170][171] Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the world's ten largest cooperatives, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative as of 2018[update].[172] It ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. Japan ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019.[173] It attracted 31.9 million international tourists in 2019,[174] and was ranked eleventh in the world in 2019 for inbound tourism.[175] The 2021 *Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report* ranked Japan first in the world out of 117 countries.[176] Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $46.1 billion.[175]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture and fishery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan\n\n![](image)A rice paddy in Aizu, Fukushima Prefecture\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the total country's GDP as of 2018[update].[115] Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.[177] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.[178] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018[update].[179] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected.[180] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.[181]\n\n\nJapan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade.[182] Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch,[81] prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.[183] Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.[184]\n\n\n\n### Industry and services[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Manufacturing in Japan, Trade and services in Japan, Electronics industry in Japan, and Automotive industry in Japan\n\n![](image)A hybrid car manufactured by Toyota. Japan is the third-largest maker of motor vehicles in the world.[185]\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the \"largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods\".[81] Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP.[81] The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world as of 2019[update].[186]\n\n\nJapan is the third-largest automobile producer in the world as of 2022[update] and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company by vehicle production.[185][187] Quantitatively, Japan was the world's largest exporter of cars in 2021,[188] though it was overtaken by China in early 2023.[189][190] The Japanese shipbuilding industry faces increasing competition from its East Asian neighbors, South Korea and China; as a 2020 government initiative identified this sector as a target for increasing exports.[191]\n\n\nJapan's service sector accounts for about 69.5% of its total economic output as of 2021[update].[192] Banking, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Toyota, Mitsubishi UFJ, -NTT, ÆON, Softbank, Hitachi, and Itochu listed as among the largest in the world.[193][194]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of science and technology in Japan, Science and technology in Japan, Video gaming in Japan, and List of Japanese inventions and discoveries\n\n![](image)The Japanese Experiment Module (Kibō) at the International Space Station\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranked 13th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[195] Relative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world,[196] with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017[update].[197] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,[198] and three Fields medalists.[199]\n\n\nJapan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 45% of the world's 2020 total;[200] down from 55% in 2017.[201] Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees.[202]\n\n\nOnce considered the strongest in the world, the Japanese consumer electronics industry is in a state of decline as regional competition arises in neighboring East Asian countries such as South Korea and China.[203] However, Japan's video game sector remains a major industry. In 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.[204] By 2015, Japan had become the world's fourth-largest PC game market, behind only China, the United States, and South Korea.[205]\n\n\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites.[206] It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibō) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.[207] The space probe *Akatsuki* was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015.[208] Japan's plans in space exploration include building a Moon base and landing astronauts by 2030.[209] In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the Moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007,[210][211] and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.[212]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Japan\n\n![](image)Japan Airlines, the flag carrier of Japan\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure.[213] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017[update].[214]\n\n\nSince privatization in 1987,[215] dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.[216]\n\n\nThere are 175 airports in Japan as of 2013[update].[81] The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second-busiest airport in 2019.[217] The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively as of 2017[update].[218]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Japan\n\n![](image)Part of the Seto Hill Windfarm\nAs of 2019[update], 37.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25.1% from coal, 22.4% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 2.8% from nuclear power, among other sources. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010.[219] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service.[220] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015,[221] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted.[222] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy.[223] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[224]\n\n\n\n### Water supply and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in Japan\n\nResponsibility for the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment, in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.[225] Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. About 98% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities.[226]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Japan, Japanese people, Ethnic groups of Japan, List of metropolitan areas in Japan, and List of cities in Japan\n\n![](image)View of Tokyo from the top of the Tokyo Skytree. The Greater Tokyo Area is ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\nJapan has a population of almost 125 million, of which nearly 122 million are Japanese nationals (2022 estimates).[227] A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder.[228] \nJapan is the world's fastest aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one-third of its total population;[229] this is the result of a post–World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates.[230] Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.4, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world's lowest;[231] it has a median age of 48.4, the highest in the world.[232] As of 2020[update], over 28.7 percent of the population is over 65, or more than one in four out of the Japanese population.[229] As a growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remaining childless,[233][234] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 88 million by 2065.[229]\n\n\nThe changes in demographic structure have created several social issues, particularly a decline in the workforce population and an increase in the cost of social security benefits.[233] The Government of Japan projects that there will be almost one elderly person for each person of working age by 2060.[232] Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.[235][236] On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.[237]\n\n\nIn 2019, 92% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.[238] The capital city, Tokyo, has a population of 13.9 million (2022).[239] It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).[240] Japan is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society,[241] with the Japanese people forming 98.1% of the country's population.[242] Minority ethnic groups in the country include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people.[243] Zainichi Koreans,[244] Chinese,[245] Filipinos,[246] Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[247] and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are also among Japan's small minority groups.[248] *Burakumin* make up a social minority group.[249]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in Japan2015 Census\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | Prefecture | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Prefecture | Pop. |\n| 1 | Tokyo | Tokyo | 9,272,740 | 11 | Hiroshima | Hiroshima | 1,194,034\n |\n| 2 | Yokohama | Kanagawa | 3,724,844 | 12 | Sendai | Miyagi | 1,082,159\n |\n| 3 | Osaka | Osaka | 2,691,185 | 13 | Chiba | Chiba | 971,882\n |\n| 4 | Nagoya | Aichi | 2,295,638 | 14 | Kitakyushu | Fukuoka | 961,286\n |\n| 5 | Sapporo | Hokkaido | 1,952,356 | 15 | Sakai | Osaka | 839,310\n |\n| 6 | Fukuoka | Fukuoka | 1,538,681 | 16 | Niigata | Niigata | 810,157\n |\n| 7 | Kobe | Hyōgo | 1,537,272 | 17 | Hamamatsu | Shizuoka | 797,980\n |\n| 8 | Kawasaki | Kanagawa | 1,475,213 | 18 | Kumamoto | Kumamoto | 740,822\n |\n| 9 | Kyoto | Kyoto | 1,475,183 | 19 | Sagamihara | Kanagawa | 720,780\n |\n| 10 | Saitama | Saitama | 1,263,979 | 20 | Okayama | Okayama | 719,474\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Japan\n\n![](image)The torii of Itsukushima Shinto Shrine near Hiroshima\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom.[250] Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion.[251] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual.[252] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.[253] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.[31]\n\n\nChristianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, 1%[254] to 1.5% of the population are Christians.[255] Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.[256]\n\n\nAbout 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants as of 2016[update].[257] As of 2018[update] there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were Japanese nationals.[258] Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Baháʼí Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.[259]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Japan\n\n![](image)*Kanji* and *hiragana* signs\nThe Japanese language is Japan's *de facto* national language and the primary written and spoken language of most people in the country.[260] Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radicals used by kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.[261] English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language. As a result, the prevalence of English in the educational system has increased, with English classes becoming mandatory at all levels of the Japanese school system by 2020.[260] Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support.[260]\n\n\nBesides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.[262] Few children learn these languages,[263] but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.[264] The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014[update].[265] Additionally, a number of other languages are taught and used by ethnic minorities, immigrant communities, and a growing number of foreign-language students, such as Korean (including a distinct Zainichi Korean dialect), Chinese and Portuguese.[260]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Japan\n\n![](image)Students celebrating after the announcement of the results of the entrance examinations to the University of Tokyo\nSince the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years.[266] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.[267] The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.[268] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.[269]\n\n\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world.[270] Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 520 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.[271][270][272] It spent roughly 3.1% of its total GDP on education as of 2018[update],[273] below the OECD average of 4.9%.[274] In 2021, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25 to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 55.6%.[275] Approximately 65% of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, and bachelor's degrees are held by 34.2% of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.[275] In 2020, the share of women among tertiary programmes graduates was 51,8%.[275]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Japan and Health care system in Japan\n\n![](image)Fujita University Hospital is the largest multi-speciality teaching hospital in Japan.\nHealth care in Japan is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments.[276] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.[277]\n\n\nJapan spent 10.74% of its total GDP on healthcare in 2019.[278] In 2020, the overall life expectancy in Japan at birth was 84.62 years (81.64 years for males and 87.74 years for females), the highest in the world;[279] while it had a very low infant mortality rate (2 per 1,000 live births).[280] Since 1981, the principal cause of death in Japan is cancer, which accounted for 27% of the total deaths in 2018—followed by cardiovascular diseases, which led to 15% of the deaths.[281] Japan has one of the world's highest suicide rates, which is considered a major social issue.[282] Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men.[283] However, Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia among developed countries.[284]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Japan\n\nSee also: Japanese popular culture\n\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America.[285] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[286] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.[106] Japan is considered a cultural superpower.[287][288]\n\n\n\n### Art and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese art\n\nFurther information: Japanese architecture, Japanese garden, Japanese esthetics, Japanese painting, and Japanese sculpture\n\n![](image)\nHokusai's 19th-century ukiyo-e woodblock print *The Great Wave off Kanagawa*\n![](image)\nRitsurin Garden, one of the most famous strolling gardens in Japan\n\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.[289] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[289]\n\n\nJapanese architecture is a combination of local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.[290] The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.[291] Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.[292] Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design.[293] It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzō Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.[294]\n\n\n\n### Literature and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Japanese literature, Japanese poetry, and Japanese philosophy\n\n![](image)12th-century illustrated handscroll of *The Tale of Genji*, a National Treasure\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the *Kojiki* and *Nihon Shoki* chronicles and the *Man'yōshū* poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.[295][296] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as *kana* (hiragana and katakana) was developed.[297] *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative.[298] An account of court life is given in *The Pillow Book* by Sei Shōnagon, while *The Tale of Genji* by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.[299][300]\n\n\nDuring the Edo period, the chōnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bashō revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinshū with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue *Oku no Hosomichi*.[301] The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Kafū Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors – Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburō Ōe (1994).[302]\n\n\nJapanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.[303] Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.[304]\n\n\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Japan and Theatre of Japan\n\n![](image)*Noh* performance at a Shinto shrine\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century.[305] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture.[306] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America.[307] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop.[308] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.[309]\n\n\nThe four traditional theaters from Japan are *noh*, *kyōgen*, *kabuki*, and *bunraku*.[310] Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.[311]\n\n\n\n### Holidays[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Public holidays in Japan and Japanese festivals\n\n![](image)Young ladies celebrate Coming of Age Day (成人の日, *Seijin no Hi*) in Harajuku, Tokyo.\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (国民の祝日に関する法律, *Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru Hōritsu*) of 1948.[312] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.[313] The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Shōwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.[314]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese cuisine\n\n![](image)A plate of *nigiri-zushi*\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.[315] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.[316] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.[317][318] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as *wagashi*.[319] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes include green tea ice cream.[320]\n\n\nPopular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14–17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.[321] Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century.[322] Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.[323]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cinema of Japan, Manga, Anime, and Media of Japan\n\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.[324] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally;[325] other popular shows are in the genres of variety shows, comedy, and news programs.[326] Many Japanese media franchises have gained considerable global popularity and are among the world's highest-grossing media franchises. Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016[update].[327]\n\n\nJapan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally.[328] Ishirō Honda's *Godzilla* became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of *kaiju* films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history.[329][330] Japanese comics, known as manga, developed in the mid-20th century and have become popular worldwide.[331][332] A large number of manga series have become some of the best-selling comics series of all time, rivalling the American comics industry.[333] Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have become highly popular internationally.[334][335]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Japan\n\n![](image)Sumo wrestlers form around the referee during the ring-entering ceremony.\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.[336] Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum.[337] Baseball is the most popular sport in the country.[338] Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), was established in 1936.[339] Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League (J.League) in 1992, association football gained a wide following.[340] The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.[341] Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times,[342] and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.[343] Golf is also popular in Japan.[344]\n\n\nIn motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, and the World Rally Championship.[345][346][347] Drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans as well as podium finishes in Formula One, in addition to success in domestic championships.[348][349] Super GT is the most popular national racing series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top-level domestic open-wheel series.[350] The country hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix.[351]\n\n\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.[352] The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship[353] and will co-host the 2023 Basketball World Championship.[354] Tokyo hosted the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.[355] The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation.[356] Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country[357] and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.[358]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* Index of Japan-related articles\n* Outline of Japan\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** [ɲippoꜜɴ] ⓘ or [ɲihoꜜɴ] ⓘ\n2. **^** In English, the official name of the country is simply \"Japan\".[11] In Japanese, the name of the country as it appears on official documents, including the country's constitution, is 日本国 (*Nippon-koku*ⓘ or *Nihon-koku*), meaning \"State of Japan\".
