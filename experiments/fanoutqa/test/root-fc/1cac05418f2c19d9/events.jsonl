The first official census took place in 1872. From that year, every 8 years (with some exceptions) the population is counted. The Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica has postponed the next census until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\nBrazil is the seventh most populated country in the world.\n\n\n\n* **1550** – 15,000\n* **1600** – 100,000\n* **1660** – 184,000\n* **1700** – 300,000\n* **1766** – 1,500,000\n* **1800** – 3,250,000\n* **1820** – 4,717,000\n* **1850** – 7,256,000\n* **1872** – 9,930,478\n* **1890** – 14,333,915\n* **1900** – 17,438,434\n* **1920** – 30,635,605\n* **1940** – 41,236,315\n* **1950** – 51,944,397\n* **1960** – 70,119,071\n* **1970** – 93,139,037\n* **1980** – 119,070,865\n* **1991** – 146,917,459\n* **1996** – 157,079,573\n* **2000** – 169,544,443\n* **2010** – 192,755,799[11]\n* **2022** – 203,062,512[12]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Brazilian states by population\nPopulation distribution in Brazil is very uneven.

The highest rate was in Acre, with 1.98 children per woman. Other regions with high fertility include Amapá, with 1.87 children per woman, Amazonas, 1.85 in Roraima, 1.84, in Maranhão, 1.82, and Pará, 1.79.\n\n\nOn the other hand, São Paulo is the state with the lowest rate, 1.26 children per woman. Other states with low fertility include Santa Catarina, with 1.28, Rio Grande do Sul, 1.3, in Rio de Janeiro, 1.32 in Paraná and Minas Gerais, 1.33.\n\n\nRegarding race of mothers, between 2015 and 2021, the fertility rate of all racial groups fell below replacement rate. Black fertility fell from 2.01 to 1.76, Pardo/Mixed fertility fell from 1.95 to 1.73 and white fertility fell from 1.90 to 1.55. There was no information regarding Asian fertility rates. Indigenous fertility was calculated at 1.87 children per women in 2010.[22]\n\n\n\n### Childlessness and education[edit]\n\n\nThe color or race of the woman and the level of education has also shown to influence the fact of not having children. In 2013, among white women aged 15 to 55 years, 41.5% had no children, while among black and brown women, the percentage was 35.8%.\n\n\nThe proportional difference is even greater among white women compared to black and brown 25–29 years.

Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of largest cities in Brazil and Largest Cities of Northeast Region, Brazil\nIn Brazil, most important cities are on the coast or close to it. State capitals are also, commonly, the largest city of their states. Notable exceptions to this are Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina.\n\n\nThere are also non-capital metropolitan areas, for example, in São Paulo state (Campinas, Santos, Paraíba Valley, Sorocaba, Ribeirão Preto and Franca), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley), and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley), amongst others.\n\n\nSão Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are far larger than any other Brazilian cities. São Paulo's influence in most economic aspects can be noted in a national (and even international) scale; Rio de Janeiro – partially due to its former status as the national capital – still host various large corporations' headquarters, besides being Brazil's cultural center with respect to film production and other such televised media. Brasília, the capital of Brazil, is its 3rd biggest city.\n\n\n\n## Migration[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nThe United Nations reported in the International Migration Stock that 64 countries had significant emigration or immigration with Brazil in 2020.[26][27] The Migration Policy Institute defines significant migration if 1,000+ people are in the emigration or/and migration group.[28] Venezuela, Haiti, Portugal, Bolivia, and Uruguay have the most positive net migration, while the United States, Japan, Spain, Italy, and France have the most negative net migration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|

etc. Brazil has received the third largest number of immigrants in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\nBrazil's structure, legislation and settlement policies for arriving immigrants were much less organized than in Canada and the United States at the time. Nevertheless, an Immigrant Inn (*Hospedaria dos Imigrantes*) was built in 1886 in São Paulo, and quick admittance and recording routines for the throngs of immigrants arriving by ship at the seaports of Vitória, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Paranaguá, Florianópolis and Porto Alegre were established. The São Paulo State alone processed more than 2.5 million immigrants in its almost 100 years of continuous operation. People of more than 70 different nationalities were recorded.\n\n\nFollowing the trend of several other countries in the Americas, which encouraged immigration from many countries, Brazil quickly became a melting pot of races and nationalities, but being peculiar in the sense of having the highest degree of intermarriage in the world. Immigrants found a strong social and cultural tolerance toward inter-racial marriage, including large numbers of Mulattoes (European and African), Caboclos (Indian and European) and mixed European, African and Indian people, though it was not accompanied by an entire lack of racism. Correspondingly, the same mentality reflected in low psychological and social barriers regarding intermarriage between Europeans, Middle Easterners and Asians of several origins, as well as between people of different religions.\n\n\n\n### History of immigration[edit]\n\n\nIt is postulated that the Americas were settled by three migratory waves from Northern Asia. The Native Brazilians are thought to descend from the first wave of migrants, who arrived in the region around 9000 BC. The main Native Brazilian groups are the Tupi-Guarani, the Jê, the Arawaks and the Caraibas (Kalina or Caribs). The Tupi-Guarani nation, originally from the Paraná river basin and also one of the largest of the Native-Paraguayan nations, had spread all along the Brazilian coastline from South to North and came to be known by the Portuguese as \"Os Índios da Língua Geral\" (\"The Indians of the General Language\"); the Jê nation occupied most of the interior of the country from Maranhão to Santa Catarina. The Arawaks and the Caribs, the last ones to get in contact with the Portuguese, lived in the North and Northwest of Brazil.\n\n\nThe European immigration to Brazil started in the 16th century, with the vast majority of them coming from Portugal. In the first two centuries of colonization, 100,000 Portuguese arrived in Brazil (around 500 colonists per year). In the 18th century, 600,000 Portuguese arrived (6,000 per year).[29] The first region to be settled by the Portuguese was Northeastern Brazil, followed by the Southeast region. The original Amerindian population of Brazil (between two and five million) largely died from disease or violence or was assimilated into the Portuguese population.[30] The Mamelucos (or Caboclos, a mixed race between Europeans and Amerindians) have always been present in many parts of Brazil.\n\n\nAnother important ethnic group, Africans, first arrived as slaves. Many came from Guinea-Bissau, or from West African countries – by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from the Kingdom of Kongo and modern-day Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Benin and Nigeria. By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around six million slaves had been brought to Brazil–50% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. Nowadays, there are still small immigration waves coming from the African continent.\nThe largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to the *Memorial do Imigrante* statistics data, Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953.[31][32]\n\n\nThese immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to Southern Brazil to work as small farmers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to Southeast Brazil to work in the coffee plantations. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly Germans (starting in 1824, mainly from Rhineland-Palatinate, Pomerania, Hamburg, Westphalia, etc.) Italians (starting in 1875, mainly from the Veneto and Lombardia), Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, Dutch and Russians. In the South, the immigrants established rural communities that retain a cultural connection with their ancestral homelands. In Southeast Brazil, most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the Veneto, Campania, Calabria and Lombardia), Portuguese (mainly from Beira Alta, Minho and Alto Trás-os-Montes), Dutch, Spaniards (mainly from Galicia and Andalusia), Lithuanians, French, Hungarians and Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n\nNotably, the first half of the 20th century saw a large inflow of Japanese (mainly from Honshū, Hokkaidō and Okinawa) and Levantine Christians from Lebanon (and few from Syria). These Christian Levantine immigrants were wrongly called \"Turks\" by many Brazilians because their original countries were still under Ottoman rule back in the period when their immigration to Brazil began. The number of actual Turks who immigrated to Brazil was in fact very small. Chinese, Taiwanese and Koreans influx became common after the 1950s.\n\n\n\n### IBGE's 1998 PME[edit]\n\n\nOn the other hand, in 1998, the IBGE, within its preparation for the 2000 census, experimentally introduced a question about \"origem\" (origin/ancestry) in its \"Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego\" (Monthly Employment Research), to test the viability of introducing that variable in the census[33]: 3 (the IBGE ended by deciding against the inclusion of questions about it in the census). This research interviewed about 90,000 people in six metropolitan regions (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and Recife).[34] To this day, it remains the only actual published survey about the immigrant origin of Brazilians.\n\n\nHere are its results:[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian Population, by ancestry, 1998[33]\n| Ancestry | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Brazil](image) \"Brazilian\" | 86.09%\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portuguese | 10.46%\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Italian | 10.41%\n |\n| Indigenous | 6.64%\n |\n| Black | 5.09%\n |\n| ![Spain](image) Spanish | 4.40%\n |\n| ![Germany](image) German | 3.54%\n |\n| African | 2.06%\n |\n| ![Japan](image) Japanese | 1.34%\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image)![Syria](image) Lebanese/Syrian | 0.48%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.20%\n |\n| Others | 2.81%\n |\n| Total | 133.52%\n |\n\n\nNotice that the total is higher than 100% because of multiple answers. Many Brazilians are unaware of their ancestry, especially those of old immigration, due to this the high number who declared themselves only as Brazilians.\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Brazilians from various socioeconomic backgrounds started to emigrate to other countries in search of better economic opportunities.\n\n\nBy the 1990s, nearly 1.9 million Brazilians were living outside the country, mainly in the United States, Paraguay and Japan,[36] but also in Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Israel. Despite the surge in the phenomenon, there were no specific policies implemented by the government to encourage or discourage this emigration process.[37] Thanks to the favourable outlook of the Brazilian economy and due to the crisis that hit countries such as Japan, Portugal or the United States, emigration of Brazilian citizens stagnated - with many returning to their home country - until 2011, when 1,898,762 Brazilians were living abroad.\n\n\nThe 2000 Brazilian census provides some information about the high number of migrants returning to Brazil. For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\nThe largest Brazilian community abroad - comprising almost half of the diaspora - is the one in the US, where around 2,000,000 Brazilians live; they are present especially in Florida. Almost 300,000 Brazilians - hence 6.8% of all Brazilians living abroad - lived in other Portuguese-speaking countries (94% in Portugal). In the same year around 680,000 Brazilians - hence 15.5% of the Brazilian diaspora - lived in Spanish-speaking countries, with the majority found in neighbouring countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n\nOther major communities are found in countries such as the UK (220,000 Brazilians in 2021), Canada (122,500 Brazilians in 2021) Ireland (70,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Australia (60,000 Brazilians in 2021).\n\n\nThere are also noticeable Brazilian communities in countries once source of immigrants such as Japan (210,000 Brazilians in 2021), Italy (162,000 Brazilians in 2021), Germany (140,000 Brazilians in 2021), the Netherlands (65,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Lebanon (21,000 Brazilians in 2021). Many of the Brazilians found in these countries are descendants of the early immigrants who came to Brazil in the early 1900s.\n\n\nThere is also a sizeable Brazilian community in France (172,000 Brazilians in 2021), almost equally split between Metropolitan France and French Guyana.\n\n\n\n## Racial composition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\n![](image)Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has Italian ancestry\n![](image)Italian regional immigration to Brazil, which has the most people of Italian origin outside Italy. Unlike other countries with Italian immigrants, Brazil prioritized Northern Italy which it considered more developed\n![](image)German colonies in Southern BrazilThe bulk of the Brazilian population descends from three main source populations (either alone, or more commonly, in varying combinations mixed in varying degrees); early European settlers (chiefly ethnic Portuguese, but also Portuguese New Christians of ethnic Sephardic Jewish origin forced to convert to Christianity),[39] sub-Saharan Africans (Yoruba, Ewe, Akan, Bantu, and others), and the indigenous peoples in Brazil (mostly Tupi and Guarani, but also many other indigenous Brazilian ethnic groups).\n\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, Brazil received substantial post-colonial immigration from several other regions, mainly from peoples of what are now the countries of Italy, Germany, Spain, Poland, as well as Middle-Eastern Christians from the Levant (mostly from what is now Lebanon, and less so from Syria), Ukraine, Japan, China and Korea.\n\n\nJews in Brazil are a small but sizable population,[40][41] and they include mostly Ashkenazi Jews (who also arrived with the post-colonial contingent of European migration),[42] a smaller proportion of Sephardi Jews (mostly Eastern Sephardim arrived with the contingent of post-colonial immigrants from Syria and Lebanon, but also North African Sephardim from Morocco settled in the Amazon, and Western Sephardim arrived with the Dutch), and to a much lesser extent Mizrahi Jews.\n\n\nOverall, the small but sizable Brazilian Jewish community is concentrated especially in São Paulo,[43] Rio de Janeiro[44] and Porto Alegre,[45] and they are accounted for without Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" (ethnic Sephardic Jews forced to convert to Christianity and arrived with the ethnic Portuguese during the colonial period),[42] which if included would inflate the Jewish origin population in Brazil considerably. By themselves, Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" are estimated to account for a figure anywhere between hundreds of thousands to several million.\n\n\nThe descendants of European immigrants, particularly the Germans, Italians, Austrians, Swiss, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Lithuanians, Scandinavians, Russians, Hungarians, Finns and Luxembourgers are mainly concentrated in the southern part of the country, in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, and the most populous, São Paulo; these states have a wide majority of citizens of European descent.[46][47]\nSão Paulo alone has the largest population in absolute numbers with 30 million Europeans.[48]\n\n\nIn the rest of the country, part of the European-Brazilian population is of colonial Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish and French settler stock, especially in the Northeast. In the mid-southern states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul and in the Federal District, the number of Europeans (European and Levantine phenotype) revolves around 50% of the population or above, being close to the proportion of people of Mixed-race Brazilians, and other minorities like Black Brazilians and East Asian Brazilians.[49]\n\n\nIn the Northeast, which received large masses of African slaves to work in sugarcane, tobacco and cotton plantations, people of African and mixed-race descent predominate, mostly on the coast, whereas in the semi-arid country land (usually called *sertão*) there is a predominance of Europeans and Amerindian-European mixed people. Most of the African or mulatto people in the *sertão* are descended from freed African slaves or mulattos who fled inland from the coast and worked as cowboys for semi-feudal lords.\n\n\nThe city of Salvador da Bahia is considered one of the largest African cities of the world. In the Northwest (covering largely the Brazilian Amazon), a great part of the population has distinguishable ethnic characteristics that emphasize their Amerindian roots. Other ethnic groups have merged with the Indigenous tribes there. This region is not densely populated, and \"caboclos\", people of mixed native and European descent, are a small part of the entire Brazilian population.\n\n\nThe Japanese are the largest Asian group in Brazil. In fact, Brazil has the largest population of Japanese ancestry outside Japan, with 1.8 million Japanese Brazilians, most of them living in São Paulo. Some Chinese and Korean also settled Brazil. Most Chinese came from mainland China, but others came from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and also from Portuguese-speaking Macau—these Chinese from Macau could speak and understand Portuguese, and it was not hard for them to adjust to Brazilian life.\n\n\nThose immigrant populations and their descendants still retain some of their original ethnic identity; however, they are not closed communities and are rapidly integrating into mainstream Brazilian society: for instance, very few of the third generation can understand their grandparents' languages.\n\n\n\n### European-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2020 census, there were more than 104 million European-Brazilians, comprising 48% of Brazil's population.[50] European-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely or mostly descended from European immigrants, although most Brazilians have some degree of European ancestry. Europeans are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although they are most concentrated in the south and southeastern parts of the country. \n[51][52]\n\n\nA survey conducted in 1998 by the Minas Gerais sociologist Simon Schwartzman interviewed about 34 million Brazilians, of whom nearly 20 million declared themselves white. Asked the ethnic origin of the participants of white race, a plurality pointed only Brazilian origin (53%).\n\n\nMore than half, however, managed to point to a foreign origin: 17.2% indicated Portuguese ancestry, 16.50% Italian, 9.42% Spanish, 6.51% German and 12.32% other origins, which include Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Dutch, Austrian, Swiss, French, Hungarian, Norwegian, partial distant African, indigenous, British, American Confederate, Jewish (mostly Ashkenazi, but also Sephardi including Jews from Morocco and Egypt) and Christian Levantine (Lebanese).[53][54]\n\n\nNearly one million Europeans had arrived in Brazil by 1800; most of them colonists from Portugal. An immigration boom occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, when nearly six million Europeans emigrated to Brazil, most of them Portuguese, Germans, Italians and Spaniards.\n\n\nMany European-Brazilians have some Amerindian and/or African ancestry (similarly found in European-Americans[55] and European-Argentines).[56] It is estimated that 75% of all Brazilians have varying degrees of Portuguese ancestry.\n\n\nNowadays, European-Brazilians come from a very diverse background, which includes:\n\n\n\n* The Dutch were among the Europeans settling in Brazil during the 17th century. From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch controlled the northeast coast of Brazil, establishing their colonial capital in Recife. During the 19th and 20th century, immigrants from the Netherlands populated the central and southern states of Brazil.[57][58] The first Dutch immigrants to South America after its independence waves from their metropoles went to the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo between 1858 and 1862, where they founded the settlement of Holanda, a colony of 500 mainly Reformed folk from West Zeelandic Flanders in the Dutch province of Zeeland.[59] Dutch and other Low Franconian languages are still spoken in São Paulo (state), especially Holambra (named after Holland-America-Brazil), famous for its tulips and the annual Expoflora event, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and around Ponta Grossa, Castrolanda and Carambeí known as little Holland, in the plains of Paraná, headquarters of several food companies and a dairy farming region.[60][61]\n* The first Germans and Austrians arrived in Brazil in 1824. Most of them established themselves in rural communities across Southern Brazil, such as São Leopoldo, Novo Hamburgo, Blumenau and Pomerode. In Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil, Germans and Austrians represented over 45% of all immigrants arriving, and in the entire country, citizens who descend from German-speaking nationalities, including Swiss and Luxemburger, but also Volga German, may represent as much as 8% of the absolute population, since Brazil is home to the second largest German-Austrian population outside their respective nations, after the USA. And German is the second most spoken mother tongue in the country.[62][63][64] According to Ethnologue, Standard German is spoken by 1.5 million people and Brazilian German encompass assorted dialects, including Riograndenser Hunsrückisch spoken by over 3 million Brazilians.[60][65][66]\n* Italians started arriving in Brazil in 1875, making up the main group of immigrants in the late 19th century.[67] First they settled in rural communities across Southern Brazil. In the early 20th century, they mostly settled in the coffee plantations in the Southeast, later moving to São Paulo capital to work in factories or starting their own businesses in trade, services and industry like businessman and industrialist count Francesco Matarazzo. In São Paulo, which came to be labeled an \"Italian city\" in the early twentieth century, Italians engaged mainly in the incipient industry and urban services activities. They came to represent 60% of the 60,000 workers employed in São Paulo factories in 1901.[68] 11% of Brazilians or 20 million citizens are of Italian extraction, possibly the largest number outside of Italy itself, most of them descended from Northern Italians, reason why Talian, or the Venetian dialect, is the third most spoken mother tongue in the nation.[69][70]\n* Poles came in significant numbers to Brazil after 1870. Most of them settled in the State of Paraná, working as small farmers.\n* Portuguese Most Brazilians are fully or partly of Portuguese ancestry. Portuguese settlers began arriving in 1500. Immigration increased during the 18th century and reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Lusitanian immigration never ceased throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Portuguese people in diaspora settled in Brazil especially during the 1970s coming from former Portuguese colonies like Macau or Angola after its independence. The Portuguese were always the largest ethnic group of immigrants to Brazil. In the early years of Portuguese colonization it is estimated that between 1500 and 1800 some 600,000 Portuguese immigrated to Brazil, and then between 1800 and 1980 another 600,000, then from 1980 to the present, 600,000 more. Portuguese immigration to Brazil will always be a constant, hence, will always comprise the largest percentage of European immigrants. By 2030, there will be an estimated 1,000,000 Portuguese total immigrants in Brazil as of 1980, significantly dwarfing all of the other immigrant groups. An additional figure of 1.2 million Portuguese arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast.[71] Nowadays, Lusitanians (Portuguese) constitute the biggest group of foreigners living in the country, with over 700,000 Portuguese nationals currently living in Brazil.[72] The vast majority arrived in the last decade. The first semester of 2011 solely had an increase of 52 thousand Portuguese nationals applying for a permanent residence visa while another large group was granted Brazilian citizenship.[73][74]\n* Spaniards came in large numbers to Brazil, starting in the late 19th century. Most of them were attracted to work in the coffee plantations in the state of São Paulo. An estimated 15 million Brazilians are of direct Spanish descent.[75]\n* Ukrainians came mostly in the late 19th century. Currently they number approximately 980,000, most of whom live in a compact settlement in south central Paraná.[76]\n\n\nSee also: Dutch Brazilian, German Brazilian, Italian Brazilian, Polish Brazilian, Portuguese Brazilian, Spanish Brazilian, and Ukrainian Brazilian\n\n### Mixed-race/Pardo-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pardo Brazilians\n\nThe Pardos can be a mixture of Europeans, Levantine, Crypto-Jews or Anusim, Africans, Amerindians, Roma and Asians. Brazil does not have a category for multiracial people, but a Pardo (brown) one, which may include caboclos, mulatos, cafuzos (local ethnonyms for people of noticeable mixed European and Amerindian, African and European, and Amerindian and African descent, i.e., mestizos, mulattoes and zambos, respectively), the multiracial result of their intermixing (despite most of European and African Brazilians possessing some degree of race-mixing, since brownness in Brazil is a matter of phenotype) and assimilated, westernized indigenous people.[77][78]\n\n\nThe Pardos make up 43.13% or 82.3 million people of Brazil's population. Multiracial Brazilians live in the entire territory of Brazil. Although, according to DNA resources, most Brazilians possess some degree of mixed-race ancestry, less than 45% of the country's population classified themselves as being part of this group due to phenotype.[79]\n\n\nThe caboclo or mestiço population, those whose ancestry is Native and European, revolves around 43 million people or 21% of the population. Genetic studies conducted by the geneticist Sergio D.J. Pena of the Federal University of Minas Gerais have shown that the caboclo population is made of individuals whose DNA ranges from 70% to 90% European (mostly Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French or Italian 1500s to 1700s male settlers) with the remaining percentage spanning different Indigenous markers.\n\n\nSimilar DNA tests showed that people self-classified as mulatto or European and African mix, span from 62% to 83% European (mostly descendants of Portuguese, Dutch and French settlers during the colonial period in the Northeast). The pardo category in Brazil also includes 800 thousand Roma people, most of them coming from Portugal but also different countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Eurasians can also be classified as pardo. The majority of them consisting of Ainoko or Hafu, individuals of Japanese and European ancestry.\n\n\nResearch has suggested that Asians from the early Portuguese Eastern Empire, known as Luso-Asians first came to Brazil during the sixteenth century as seamen known as Lascars, or as servants, slaves and concubines accompanying the governors, merchants and clergy who has served in Portuguese Asia.[80] This first presence of Asians was limited to Northeast Brazil, especially Bahia, but others were brought as cultivators, textile workers and miners to Pará and other parts of the Northeast.\n\n\n\n### African-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Afro-Brazilians\n\nAfrican-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely, or mostly, descended from former African slaves, or immigrants. According to the 2010 census, there are 14,517,961 Black Brazilians, about 7.6% of the population.[81]\n\n\nAlthough the majority of Brazilians have at least some degree of African heritage, the racial makeup of black Brazilians themselves is very mixed and mostly of them have a significant degree of white admixture with a minor indigenous component, the range of white admixture for Afro-Brazilians is typically between 30% and 70%; \"pure\" black Brazilians with more than 80% of their genes coming from African ancestry are a subgroup minority.[79]\n\n\n\n### Asian-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asian Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2006 census, people of East Asian descent number 1,919,000, or 1.1% of Brazil's population. Estimates say that there are 2.5 to 3.0 million people of Japanese descent in Brazil, who are mostly concentrated in two states: São Paulo and Paraná, but smaller communities are found in the entire territory of the country. Brazil has the largest population of Japanese descent outside Japan.[82]\n\n\nThere are also smaller communities of Korean people and Chinese origin.[83] Some Chinese, especially from Macau, speak a Portuguese-based creole language called Macanese (patuá or macaísta), aside from Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese. Japanese immigration to Brazil started on 18 June 1908, when the Japanese ship Kasato-Maru arrived in the Port of Santos, south of São Paulo, carrying the first 781 people to take advantage of a bilateral agreement promoting immigration.\n\n\nHalf of them were from the southern part of the Okinawa Island, located about 640 km (400 miles) south of the rest of Japan, which had its own distinct language and culture dating back to before the island's annexation by Tokyo in 1879. The names on shop fronts are in Japanese and selling everything from Japanese food and kitchen utensils to traditional home decorations. Red painted archways, Japanese temples and a Japanese garden are present in this little Japanese corner of Brazil.\n\n\n\n### Aboriginal-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples in Brazil\n\nThe Amerindians make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 700,000 people. Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Centre-Western part of the country. Over 60 million Brazilians possess at least one Native South American ancestor, according to a mitochondrial DNA study.[84]\n\n\nHowever, only 0.4% of the population consider themselves to be Natives. Brazilians tend to consider \"Native South American\" a cultural, not racial category. When the first Portuguese arrived in Brazil, in 1500, there were between 2.5 and 3.2 million Natives living in the country. In the mid-19th century they were only 100,000 and in the late 20th century close to 300,000.\n\n\n\n## Genetic studies[edit]\n\n\nGenetic studies have shown the Brazilian population as a whole to have European, African and Native American components.\n\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA studies[edit]\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal DNA genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 58%\n | 27%\n | 15%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study (2011), with nearly 1000 samples from every major race group (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\", according to their respective proportions) all over the country found out a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component.[86]\n\n\n\"In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South\". The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil[87]), and also public health institutions personnel and health students.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Region[86] | European\n | African\n | Native American\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Northern Brazil | 68.80%\n | 10.50%\n | 18.50%\n |\n| Northeast Brazil | 69.10%\n | 18.30%\n | 12.40%\n |\n| Southeast Brazil | 74.20%\n | 17.30%\n | 7.30%\n |\n| Southern Brazil | 79.50%\n | 10.30%\n | 9.40%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban\npopulations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.[88]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[89] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 17%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 26%\n | 13%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 58%\n | 26%\n | 16%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 61%\n | 27%\n | 12%\n |\n| South Region | 74%\n | 15%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile: \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\".[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[91] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 60.6%\n | 21.3%\n | 18.1%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 68.3%\n | 21.1%\n | 10.6%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 66.3%\n | 21.7%\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 60.7%\n | 32.0%\n | 7.3%\n |\n| South Region | 81.5%\n | 9.3%\n | 9.2%\n |\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 23%\n | 16%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nPairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations\".[92]\n\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.80%) and the Native American (9.3%).[93]\n\n\nSão Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American.[94] A study from 2013 found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American.[95] Another study focused on highly admixed populations yielded similar results.[96]\n\n\n\n## Races and ethnicities by region[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Brazil socio-geographic division\n\n### South[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Centro-Sul\n\nThe South of Brazil is the region with the largest percentage of Europeans. According to the 2005 census, people of European ancestry account for 87% of the population.[82] In colonial times, this region had a very small population.\n\n\nThe region what is now Southern Brazil was originally settled by Amerindian peoples, mostly Guarani and Kaingangs.[97] Only a few settlers from São Paulo were living there. This situation made the region vulnerable to attacks from neighboring countries. This fact forced the King of Portugal to decide to populate the region. For this, settlers from the Portuguese Azores islands were sent to the coast in 1617.[98]\n\n\nTo stimulate the immigration to Brazil, the king offered several benefits for the Azorean couples. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Portuguese from the Azores moved to the coast of Santa Catarina. They were mainly newly married who were seeking a better life. At that time, the Azores were one of the poorest regions of Portugal.\n\n\nThey established themselves mainly in the Santa Catarina Island, nowadays the region of Florianópolis. Later, some couples moved to Rio Grande do Sul, where they established Porto Alegre, the capital. The Azoreans lived on fishing and agriculture, especially flour. They composed over half of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina's population in the late 18th century.[99] The state of Paraná was settled by colonists from São Paulo due to their proximity (Paraná was part of São Paulo until the mid-19th century).\n\n\nWith the development of cattle in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, African slaves began arriving in large numbers. By 1822, Africans were 50% of Rio Grande do Sul's population. This number decreased to 25% in 1858 and to only 5.2% in 2005. Most of them came from Angola.[100]\n\n\nAfter independence from Portugal (1822) the Brazilian government started to stimulate the arrival of a new wave of immigrants to settle the South. In 1824 they established São Leopoldo, a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From Rhineland-Palatinate, the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers.[101]\n\n\nTo attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of São Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at São Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of Novo Hamburgo (*New Hamburg*).[102]\n\n\nFrom São Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of Rio Grande do Sul, mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country (Ragamuffin War). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were Blumenau, in 1850, and Joinville in 1851, both in Santa Catarina state; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region.\nIn the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside.[103] By 1914, it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state.\n\n\nAnother immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul (Serra Gaúcha). These were Garibaldi and Bento Gonçalves. These immigrants were predominantly from Veneto, in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, Caxias do Sul. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of Rio Grande do Sul seeking further opportunities.[104]\n\n\nThey created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native *gaúchos*. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in Santa Catarina, which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as Criciúma, and later also spread further north, to Paraná.\n\n\nA significant number of Poles have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869 and until 1959, it is estimated that over 100,000 Poles migrated to Brazil,[105] 95% of whom were peasants. The State of Paraná received the majority of Polish immigrants, who settled mainly in the region of Curitiba, in the towns of Mallet, Cruz Machado, São Matheus do Sul, Irati, and União da Vitória.[106]\n\n\n\n### Southeast[edit]\n\n\nThe Southeastern region of Brazil is the most ethnically diverse part of the country. Europeans make up 55.16% of its population, those of mixed-race 35.69%, and African descent 7.91%. It has the largest percentage of Asian Brazilians, composing 0.8%, and a small Amerindian community (0.2%).\n\n\nSoutheast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese village in the Americas, São Vicente, São Paulo, established in 1532.[107] The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a melting pot of Africans, Natives, and Europeans. The Indigenous peoples of the region were enslaved by the Portuguese.\n\n\nThe race mixing between the indigenous females and their European masters produced the Bandeirante, the colonial inhabitant of São Paulo, who formed expeditions that crossed the interior of Brazil and greatly increased the Portuguese colonial territory. The main language spoken by these people of mixed Indian/Portuguese heritage was Língua geral, a language that mixed Tupi and Portuguese words.\n\n\nIn the late 17th century the Bandeirantes found gold in the area that nowadays is Minas Gerais. A gold rush took place in Brazil and thousands of Portuguese colonists arrived during this period. The confrontation between the Bandeirantes and the Portuguese for obtaining possession of the mines led to the Emboabas' War.\n\n\nThe Portuguese won the war. The Amerindian culture declined, giving space to a stronger Portuguese cultural domination. In order to control the wealth, the Portuguese Crown moved the capital of Brazil from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of African slaves were brought to work in the gold mines.\n\n\nThey were landed in Rio de Janeiro and sent to other regions. By the late 18th century, Rio de Janeiro was an \"African city\": most of its inhabitants were slaves. No other place in the world had as many slaves since the end of the Roman Empire.[108] In 1808 the Portuguese royal family, fleeing from Napoleon, took charge in Rio de Janeiro. Some 15,000 Portuguese nobles moved to Brazil. The region changed a lot, becoming more European.\n\n\nAfter independence and principally after 1850, Southeast Brazil was \"inundated\" by European immigrants, who were attracted by the government to replace the African slaves in the coffee plantations. Most immigrants landed in the Port of Santos and have been forwarded to the coffee farms within São Paulo.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the immigrants came from Italy. Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. The large number of Italians are visible in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas. For example, Northeast São Paulo is 45% Italian.[109]\n\n\nThe arrival of immigrants from several parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population. The city of Bastos, in São Paulo, is 11.4% Japanese. The city of São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself.\n[110]\n\n\n\n### Northeast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Nordeste (socio-geographic division)\n\nThe population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as \"Pardo\" (Multiracial) make up 60.5% of the population. Those reported as African account for 5.9%.\n\n\nThis region did not have much effect from the massive European immigration that took place in Southern Brazil in the late 19th century and first decades of the 20th century. The Northeast has been a poorer region of Brazil since the decline of sugar cane plantations in the late 17th century, so its economy did not require immigrants.\n\n\nThe ethnic composition of the population starts in the 16th century. The Portuguese settlers rarely brought women, which led to relationships with the Indian women. Later, interracial relationships occurred between Portuguese males and African females. The coast, in the past the place where millions of African slaves arrived (mostly from modern-day Angola, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin) to work in sugar-cane plantations, is where nowadays there is a predominance of Mulattoes, those of African and European ancestry. Salvador, Bahia is considered the largest African city outside of Africa, with over 80% of its inhabitants being African-Brazilians. In the interior, there is a predominance of Indian and European mixture.[111]\n\n\n\n### North[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Amazônia Legal\n\nNorthern Brazil, largely covered by the Amazon rainforest, is the Brazilian region with the largest Amerindian influences, both in culture and ethnicity. Inhabited by diverse indigenous tribes, this part of Brazil was reached by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 17th century, but it started to be populated by non-Indians only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exploitation of rubber used in the growing industries of automobiles, has emerged a huge migration to the region.\n\n\nMany people from the poor Northeast Brazil, mostly Ceará, moved to the Amazon area. The contact between the Indians and the northeastern rubbers created the base of the ethnic composition of the region, with its mixed-race majority.\n\n\n\n### Central-West[edit]\n\n\nThe Central-West region of Brazil was inhabited by diverse Indians when the Portuguese arrived in the early 18th century. The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.\n\n\n\n## Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Health care in Brazil\n\nThe Federal Constitution of 1988 and the 1996 *General Law of Education in Brazil* (LDB) attributed to the Federal Government, states, Federal District and municipalities the responsibility of managing the Brazilian educational system, considering three educational public systems as a basis for collaboration between these federal systems.\n\n\nEach of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as mechanisms and sources for financial resources. The new Constitution reserves 25% of state and municipal taxes and 18% of federal taxes for education.[112]\n\n\nAs set out by the Brazilian Constitution, the main responsibility for basic education is attributed to the states and municipalities. Hence, a historical feature of Brazilian basic education is its extremely decentralized nature, which gives great organizational autonomy to sub-national governments (27 states and 5,546 municipalities) in organizing their educational systems.\n\n\nEarly childhood education, from 0–6 years, is under exclusive responsibility of the municipalities. Responsibility for compulsory primary education from 1st to 9th grades is shared between states and municipalities. Kindergarten and pre-school education are the responsibility of local levels of government, whereas secondary schools are under the responsibility of the states.\n\n\nMaintenance of the system, including salaries, the definition of teacher career structures and supervision of early childhood, primary, and secondary levels (which make up basic education) is decentralized, and these levels are responsible for defining their respective curriculum content.\n\n\nHigher education starts with undergraduate or sequential courses, which may offer different specialization choices such as academic or vocational paths. Depending on the choice, students may improve their educational background with *Stricto Sensu* or *Lato Sensu* postgraduate courses.\n\n\nHigher education has three main purposes: teaching, research and extension, each with their own specific contribution to make to a particular course. Diplomas and certificates are proof of having passed through higher education.\n\n\nAccording to Brazilian Government, the most serious health problems are:[113]\n\n\n\n* Childhood mortality: about 2.51% of childhood mortality, reaching 3.77% in the northeast region.\n* Motherhood mortality: about 73.1 deaths per 100,000 born children in 2002.\n* Mortality by non-transmissible illness: 151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by heart and circulatory diseases, along with 72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by cancer.\n* Mortality caused by external causes (transportation, violence and suicide): 71.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (14.9% of all deaths in the country), reaching 82.3 deaths in the southeast region.\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Brazil\n\nAccording to the IBGE census 2010[114] 64.6% are Roman Catholics; 24% are Protestants and other Christians, 8% are agnostics, atheists or have no religion, 2% are followers of Spiritism, and 1% are members of other religions. Some of these religions are Jehovah's Witnesses (1,100,000), Latter-day Saints (200,000), Buddhism (215,000), Judaism (86,000), and Islam (27,000).[115]\n\n\nBrazil has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world.[116]\n\n\nFollowers of Protestantism are rising in number. Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were adherents of \"traditional churches\", mostly Lutherans, Presbyterians and Baptists. There are 120,000 Episcopalians in 9 dioceses (Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil). Since then, numbers of Pentecostal and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.\n\n\nIslam in Brazil was first practiced by African slaves.[117] The Muslim population in Brazil is made up mostly of Arab immigrants.[118]\n\n\nThe largest population of Buddhists in Latin America lives in Brazil, due greatly to Brazil's large Japanese population.\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Brazil and Portuguese language\n\nPortuguese is the only official language of Brazil.[119] It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio, TV and for all business and administrative purposes. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity.\n\n\nMany Amerindian languages are spoken daily in indigenous communities, primarily in Northern Brazil. Although many of these communities have significant contact with Portuguese,[120] there are incentives stimulating preservation and the teaching of native languages. According to SIL International, 133 Native American languages are currently endangered. Some of the largest indigenous language groups include Arawak, Carib, Macro-Gê and Tupi.[121] In 2006, the City of São Gabriel da Cachoeira in the region of Cabeça do Cachorro (Northwestern region of the State of Amazonas), has adopted some indigenous languages as some of its other official languages along with Portuguese.\n\n\nOther languages are spoken by descendants of immigrants, who are usually bilingual, in small rural communities in Southern Brazil. The most important are the Brazilian German dialects, such as Riograndenser Hunsrückisch and the East Pomeranian dialect, and also the Talian, based on the Italian Venetian language. There are also bilingual speakers of Polish, Ukrainian and Russian in Southern Brazil, especially Paraná. In the city of São Paulo, Levantine, Japanese, Chinese and Korean can be heard in the immigrant neighborhoods, such as Liberdade. Yiddish and Hebrew are used by Jewish communities mainly in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Brasília, Belo Horizonte and Recife as well as the Vlax Romani dialect by Romani communities all across the nation.\n\n\n\n## *The World Factbook* demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from *The World Factbook*, unless otherwise indicated[122]\n\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\n* noun: Brazilian(s)\n* adjective: Brazilian\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n* 217,650,530\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n* Portuguese (official)\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n* European | mainly Portuguese 47.6%\n* Caboclo, Castizo 23.1%\n* Mulatto, Quadroon, Octoroon 21%\n* Black Brazilians 7.0%\n* Asian (mainly Japanese) 1.2%\n* Indigenous 0.4%\n* Romani 0.4%\n* Eurasian, Hafu 0.3%\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\n* Total population: 94.4%\n* Male: 92.4%\n* Female: 96.4% (2019 est.)\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\n* Roman Catholic 64.6%\n* Other Catholic 0.4%\n* Protestant 22.2%\n\t+ Adventist (including Seventh-day Adventist and Adventist Church of Promise) 6.5%\n\t+ Assembly of God 2.0%\n\t+ Christian Congregation of Brazil 1.2%\n\t+ Universal Church of the Kingdom of God 1.0%\n\t+ Other Protestant 11.5%\n\t+ Other Christian 0.7%\n* Spiritist 2.2%\n* Other 1.4%\n* None 8%\n* Unspecified 0.4%\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Brazil\n* 2022 Brazilian census\n* Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n* Demographics of Rio de Janeiro\n* List of largest cities in Brazil\n* Racial democracy\n* *Brazilian Journal of Population Studies*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** População do Brasil – IBGE\n2. **^** \"Censo Demográfi co 20200 Características da população e dos domicílios Resultados do universo\" (PDF). 8 November 2021.

The first official census took place in 1872. From that year, every 8 years (with some exceptions) the population is counted.

The highest rate was in Acre, with 1.98 children per woman. Other regions with high fertility include Amapá, with 1.87 children per woman, Amazonas, 1.85 in Roraima, 1.84, in Maranhão, 1.82, and Pará, 1.79.\n\n\nOn the other hand, São Paulo is the state with the lowest rate, 1.26 children per woman. Other states with low fertility include Santa Catarina, with 1.28, Rio Grande do Sul, 1.3, in Rio de Janeiro, 1.32 in Paraná and Minas Gerais, 1.33.\n\n\nRegarding race of mothers, between 2015 and 2021, the fertility rate of all racial groups fell below replacement rate. Black fertility fell from 2.01 to 1.76, Pardo/Mixed fertility fell from 1.95 to 1.73 and white fertility fell from 1.90 to 1.55. There was no information regarding Asian fertility rates. Indigenous fertility was calculated at 1.87 children per women in 2010.[22]\n\n\n\n### Childlessness and education[edit]\n\n\nThe color or race of the woman and the level of education has also shown to influence the fact of not having children. In 2013, among white women aged 15 to 55 years, 41.5% had no children, while among black and brown women, the percentage was 35.8%.\n\n\nThe proportional difference is even greater among white women compared to black and brown 25–29 years. While the proportion among white women childless was 48.1% among black and brown women was 33.8%.\n\n\nRegarding education, among women 15–49 years of age with more than eight years of schooling, 44.2% had no children in 2013, while among those with up to seven years of study this figure was 21.6%.\n\n\nSchooling among women 25–29 years has shown an even greater disparity. Among the less educated, 16.3% had no children, while among the more educated 54.5% had no children.

Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of largest cities in Brazil and Largest Cities of Northeast Region, Brazil\nIn Brazil, most important cities are on the coast or close to it. State capitals are also, commonly, the largest city of their states. Notable exceptions to this are Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina.\n\n\nThere are also non-capital metropolitan areas, for example, in São Paulo state (Campinas, Santos, Paraíba Valley, Sorocaba, Ribeirão Preto and Franca), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley), and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley), amongst others.\n\n\nSão Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are far larger than any other Brazilian cities. São Paulo's influence in most economic aspects can be noted in a national (and even international) scale; Rio de Janeiro – partially due to its former status as the national capital – still host various large corporations' headquarters, besides being Brazil's cultural center with respect to film production and other such televised media. Brasília, the capital of Brazil, is its 3rd biggest city.\n\n\n\n## Migration[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nThe United Nations reported in the International Migration Stock that 64 countries had significant emigration or immigration with Brazil in 2020.[26][27] The Migration Policy Institute defines significant migration if 1,000+ people are in the emigration or/and migration group.[28] Venezuela, Haiti, Portugal, Bolivia, and Uruguay have the most positive net migration, while the United States, Japan, Spain, Italy, and France have the most negative net migration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|

etc. Brazil has received the third largest number of immigrants in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\nBrazil's structure, legislation and settlement policies for arriving immigrants were much less organized than in Canada and the United States at the time. Nevertheless, an Immigrant Inn (*Hospedaria dos Imigrantes*) was built in 1886 in São Paulo, and quick admittance and recording routines for the throngs of immigrants arriving by ship at the seaports of Vitória, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Paranaguá, Florianópolis and Porto Alegre were established. The São Paulo State alone processed more than 2.5 million immigrants in its almost 100 years of continuous operation. People of more than 70 different nationalities were recorded.\n\n\nFollowing the trend of several other countries in the Americas, which encouraged immigration from many countries, Brazil quickly became a melting pot of races and nationalities, but being peculiar in the sense of having the highest degree of intermarriage in the world. Immigrants found a strong social and cultural tolerance toward inter-racial marriage, including large numbers of Mulattoes (European and African), Caboclos (Indian and European) and mixed European, African and Indian people, though it was not accompanied by an entire lack of racism. Correspondingly, the same mentality reflected in low psychological and social barriers regarding intermarriage between Europeans, Middle Easterners and Asians of several origins, as well as between people of different religions.\n\n\n\n### History of immigration[edit]\n\n\nIt is postulated that the Americas were settled by three migratory waves from Northern Asia. The Native Brazilians are thought to descend from the first wave of migrants, who arrived in the region around 9000 BC. The main Native Brazilian groups are the Tupi-Guarani, the Jê, the Arawaks and the Caraibas (Kalina or Caribs). The Tupi-Guarani nation, originally from the Paraná river basin and also one of the largest of the Native-Paraguayan nations, had spread all along the Brazilian coastline from South to North and came to be known by the Portuguese as \"Os Índios da Língua Geral\" (\"The Indians of the General Language\"); the Jê nation occupied most of the interior of the country from Maranhão to Santa Catarina. The Arawaks and the Caribs, the last ones to get in contact with the Portuguese, lived in the North and Northwest of Brazil.\n\n\nThe European immigration to Brazil started in the 16th century, with the vast majority of them coming from Portugal. In the first two centuries of colonization, 100,000 Portuguese arrived in Brazil (around 500 colonists per year). In the 18th century, 600,000 Portuguese arrived (6,000 per year).[29] The first region to be settled by the Portuguese was Northeastern Brazil, followed by the Southeast region. The original Amerindian population of Brazil (between two and five million) largely died from disease or violence or was assimilated into the Portuguese population.[30] The Mamelucos (or Caboclos, a mixed race between Europeans and Amerindians) have always been present in many parts of Brazil.\n\n\nAnother important ethnic group, Africans, first arrived as slaves. Many came from Guinea-Bissau, or from West African countries – by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from the Kingdom of Kongo and modern-day Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Benin and Nigeria. By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around six million slaves had been brought to Brazil–50% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. Nowadays, there are still small immigration waves coming from the African continent.\nThe largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to the *Memorial do Imigrante* statistics data, Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953.[31][32]\n\n\nThese immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to Southern Brazil to work as small farmers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to Southeast Brazil to work in the coffee plantations. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly Germans (starting in 1824, mainly from Rhineland-Palatinate, Pomerania, Hamburg, Westphalia, etc.) Italians (starting in 1875, mainly from the Veneto and Lombardia), Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, Dutch and Russians. In the South, the immigrants established rural communities that retain a cultural connection with their ancestral homelands. In Southeast Brazil, most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the Veneto, Campania, Calabria and Lombardia), Portuguese (mainly from Beira Alta, Minho and Alto Trás-os-Montes), Dutch, Spaniards (mainly from Galicia and Andalusia), Lithuanians, French, Hungarians and Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n\nNotably, the first half of the 20th century saw a large inflow of Japanese (mainly from Honshū, Hokkaidō and Okinawa) and Levantine Christians from Lebanon (and few from Syria). These Christian Levantine immigrants were wrongly called \"Turks\" by many Brazilians because their original countries were still under Ottoman rule back in the period when their immigration to Brazil began. The number of actual Turks who immigrated to Brazil was in fact very small. Chinese, Taiwanese and Koreans influx became common after the 1950s.\n\n\n\n### IBGE's 1998 PME[edit]\n\n\nOn the other hand, in 1998, the IBGE, within its preparation for the 2000 census, experimentally introduced a question about \"origem\" (origin/ancestry) in its \"Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego\" (Monthly Employment Research), to test the viability of introducing that variable in the census[33]: 3 (the IBGE ended by deciding against the inclusion of questions about it in the census). This research interviewed about 90,000 people in six metropolitan regions (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and Recife).[34] To this day, it remains the only actual published survey about the immigrant origin of Brazilians.\n\n\nHere are its results:[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian Population, by ancestry, 1998[33]\n| Ancestry | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Brazil](image) \"Brazilian\" | 86.09%\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portuguese | 10.46%\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Italian | 10.41%\n |\n| Indigenous | 6.64%\n |\n| Black | 5.09%\n |\n| ![Spain](image) Spanish | 4.40%\n |\n| ![Germany](image) German | 3.54%\n |\n| African | 2.06%\n |\n| ![Japan](image) Japanese | 1.34%\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image)![Syria](image) Lebanese/Syrian | 0.48%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.20%\n |\n| Others | 2.81%\n |\n| Total | 133.52%\n |\n\n\nNotice that the total is higher than 100% because of multiple answers. Many Brazilians are unaware of their ancestry, especially those of old immigration, due to this the high number who declared themselves only as Brazilians.\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Brazilians from various socioeconomic backgrounds started to emigrate to other countries in search of better economic opportunities.\n\n\nBy the 1990s, nearly 1.9 million Brazilians were living outside the country, mainly in the United States, Paraguay and Japan,[36] but also in Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Israel. Despite the surge in the phenomenon, there were no specific policies implemented by the government to encourage or discourage this emigration process.[37] Thanks to the favourable outlook of the Brazilian economy and due to the crisis that hit countries such as Japan, Portugal or the United States, emigration of Brazilian citizens stagnated - with many returning to their home country - until 2011, when 1,898,762 Brazilians were living abroad.\n\n\nThe 2000 Brazilian census provides some information about the high number of migrants returning to Brazil. For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\nThe largest Brazilian community abroad - comprising almost half of the diaspora - is the one in the US, where around 2,000,000 Brazilians live; they are present especially in Florida. Almost 300,000 Brazilians - hence 6.8% of all Brazilians living abroad - lived in other Portuguese-speaking countries (94% in Portugal). In the same year around 680,000 Brazilians - hence 15.5% of the Brazilian diaspora - lived in Spanish-speaking countries, with the majority found in neighbouring countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n\nOther major communities are found in countries such as the UK (220,000 Brazilians in 2021), Canada (122,500 Brazilians in 2021) Ireland (70,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Australia (60,000 Brazilians in 2021).\n\n\nThere are also noticeable Brazilian communities in countries once source of immigrants such as Japan (210,000 Brazilians in 2021), Italy (162,000 Brazilians in 2021), Germany (140,000 Brazilians in 2021), the Netherlands (65,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Lebanon (21,000 Brazilians in 2021). Many of the Brazilians found in these countries are descendants of the early immigrants who came to Brazil in the early 1900s.\n\n\nThere is also a sizeable Brazilian community in France (172,000 Brazilians in 2021), almost equally split between Metropolitan France and French Guyana.\n\n\n\n## Racial composition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\n![](image)Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has Italian ancestry\n![](image)Italian regional immigration to Brazil, which has the most people of Italian origin outside Italy. Unlike other countries with Italian immigrants, Brazil prioritized Northern Italy which it considered more developed\n![](image)German colonies in Southern BrazilThe bulk of the Brazilian population descends from three main source populations (either alone, or more commonly, in varying combinations mixed in varying degrees); early European settlers (chiefly ethnic Portuguese, but also Portuguese New Christians of ethnic Sephardic Jewish origin forced to convert to Christianity),[39] sub-Saharan Africans (Yoruba, Ewe, Akan, Bantu, and others), and the indigenous peoples in Brazil (mostly Tupi and Guarani, but also many other indigenous Brazilian ethnic groups).\n\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, Brazil received substantial post-colonial immigration from several other regions, mainly from peoples of what are now the countries of Italy, Germany, Spain, Poland, as well as Middle-Eastern Christians from the Levant (mostly from what is now Lebanon, and less so from Syria), Ukraine, Japan, China and Korea.\n\n\nJews in Brazil are a small but sizable population,[40][41] and they include mostly Ashkenazi Jews (who also arrived with the post-colonial contingent of European migration),[42] a smaller proportion of Sephardi Jews (mostly Eastern Sephardim arrived with the contingent of post-colonial immigrants from Syria and Lebanon, but also North African Sephardim from Morocco settled in the Amazon, and Western Sephardim arrived with the Dutch), and to a much lesser extent Mizrahi Jews.\n\n\nOverall, the small but sizable Brazilian Jewish community is concentrated especially in São Paulo,[43] Rio de Janeiro[44] and Porto Alegre,[45] and they are accounted for without Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" (ethnic Sephardic Jews forced to convert to Christianity and arrived with the ethnic Portuguese during the colonial period),[42] which if included would inflate the Jewish origin population in Brazil considerably. By themselves, Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" are estimated to account for a figure anywhere between hundreds of thousands to several million.\n\n\nThe descendants of European immigrants, particularly the Germans, Italians, Austrians, Swiss, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Lithuanians, Scandinavians, Russians, Hungarians, Finns and Luxembourgers are mainly concentrated in the southern part of the country, in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, and the most populous, São Paulo; these states have a wide majority of citizens of European descent.[46][47]\nSão Paulo alone has the largest population in absolute numbers with 30 million Europeans.[48]\n\n\nIn the rest of the country, part of the European-Brazilian population is of colonial Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish and French settler stock, especially in the Northeast. In the mid-southern states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul and in the Federal District, the number of Europeans (European and Levantine phenotype) revolves around 50% of the population or above, being close to the proportion of people of Mixed-race Brazilians, and other minorities like Black Brazilians and East Asian Brazilians.[49]\n\n\nIn the Northeast, which received large masses of African slaves to work in sugarcane, tobacco and cotton plantations, people of African and mixed-race descent predominate, mostly on the coast, whereas in the semi-arid country land (usually called *sertão*) there is a predominance of Europeans and Amerindian-European mixed people. Most of the African or mulatto people in the *sertão* are descended from freed African slaves or mulattos who fled inland from the coast and worked as cowboys for semi-feudal lords.\n\n\nThe city of Salvador da Bahia is considered one of the largest African cities of the world. In the Northwest (covering largely the Brazilian Amazon), a great part of the population has distinguishable ethnic characteristics that emphasize their Amerindian roots. Other ethnic groups have merged with the Indigenous tribes there. This region is not densely populated, and \"caboclos\", people of mixed native and European descent, are a small part of the entire Brazilian population.\n\n\nThe Japanese are the largest Asian group in Brazil. In fact, Brazil has the largest population of Japanese ancestry outside Japan, with 1.8 million Japanese Brazilians, most of them living in São Paulo. Some Chinese and Korean also settled Brazil. Most Chinese came from mainland China, but others came from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and also from Portuguese-speaking Macau—these Chinese from Macau could speak and understand Portuguese, and it was not hard for them to adjust to Brazilian life.\n\n\nThose immigrant populations and their descendants still retain some of their original ethnic identity; however, they are not closed communities and are rapidly integrating into mainstream Brazilian society: for instance, very few of the third generation can understand their grandparents' languages.\n\n\n\n### European-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2020 census, there were more than 104 million European-Brazilians, comprising 48% of Brazil's population.[50] European-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely or mostly descended from European immigrants, although most Brazilians have some degree of European ancestry. Europeans are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although they are most concentrated in the south and southeastern parts of the country. \n[51][52]\n\n\nA survey conducted in 1998 by the Minas Gerais sociologist Simon Schwartzman interviewed about 34 million Brazilians, of whom nearly 20 million declared themselves white. Asked the ethnic origin of the participants of white race, a plurality pointed only Brazilian origin (53%).\n\n\nMore than half, however, managed to point to a foreign origin: 17.2% indicated Portuguese ancestry, 16.50% Italian, 9.42% Spanish, 6.51% German and 12.32% other origins, which include Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Dutch, Austrian, Swiss, French, Hungarian, Norwegian, partial distant African, indigenous, British, American Confederate, Jewish (mostly Ashkenazi, but also Sephardi including Jews from Morocco and Egypt) and Christian Levantine (Lebanese).[53][54]\n\n\nNearly one million Europeans had arrived in Brazil by 1800; most of them colonists from Portugal. An immigration boom occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, when nearly six million Europeans emigrated to Brazil, most of them Portuguese, Germans, Italians and Spaniards.\n\n\nMany European-Brazilians have some Amerindian and/or African ancestry (similarly found in European-Americans[55] and European-Argentines).[56] It is estimated that 75% of all Brazilians have varying degrees of Portuguese ancestry.\n\n\nNowadays, European-Brazilians come from a very diverse background, which includes:\n\n\n\n* The Dutch were among the Europeans settling in Brazil during the 17th century. From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch controlled the northeast coast of Brazil, establishing their colonial capital in Recife. During the 19th and 20th century, immigrants from the Netherlands populated the central and southern states of Brazil.[57][58] The first Dutch immigrants to South America after its independence waves from their metropoles went to the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo between 1858 and 1862, where they founded the settlement of Holanda, a colony of 500 mainly Reformed folk from West Zeelandic Flanders in the Dutch province of Zeeland.[59] Dutch and other Low Franconian languages are still spoken in São Paulo (state), especially Holambra (named after Holland-America-Brazil), famous for its tulips and the annual Expoflora event, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and around Ponta Grossa, Castrolanda and Carambeí known as little Holland, in the plains of Paraná, headquarters of several food companies and a dairy farming region.[60][61]\n* The first Germans and Austrians arrived in Brazil in 1824. Most of them established themselves in rural communities across Southern Brazil, such as São Leopoldo, Novo Hamburgo, Blumenau and Pomerode. In Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil, Germans and Austrians represented over 45% of all immigrants arriving, and in the entire country, citizens who descend from German-speaking nationalities, including Swiss and Luxemburger, but also Volga German, may represent as much as 8% of the absolute population, since Brazil is home to the second largest German-Austrian population outside their respective nations, after the USA. And German is the second most spoken mother tongue in the country.[62][63][64] According to Ethnologue, Standard German is spoken by 1.5 million people and Brazilian German encompass assorted dialects, including Riograndenser Hunsrückisch spoken by over 3 million Brazilians.[60][65][66]\n* Italians started arriving in Brazil in 1875, making up the main group of immigrants in the late 19th century.[67] First they settled in rural communities across Southern Brazil. In the early 20th century, they mostly settled in the coffee plantations in the Southeast, later moving to São Paulo capital to work in factories or starting their own businesses in trade, services and industry like businessman and industrialist count Francesco Matarazzo. In São Paulo, which came to be labeled an \"Italian city\" in the early twentieth century, Italians engaged mainly in the incipient industry and urban services activities. They came to represent 60% of the 60,000 workers employed in São Paulo factories in 1901.[68] 11% of Brazilians or 20 million citizens are of Italian extraction, possibly the largest number outside of Italy itself, most of them descended from Northern Italians, reason why Talian, or the Venetian dialect, is the third most spoken mother tongue in the nation.[69][70]\n* Poles came in significant numbers to Brazil after 1870. Most of them settled in the State of Paraná, working as small farmers.\n* Portuguese Most Brazilians are fully or partly of Portuguese ancestry. Portuguese settlers began arriving in 1500. Immigration increased during the 18th century and reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Lusitanian immigration never ceased throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Portuguese people in diaspora settled in Brazil especially during the 1970s coming from former Portuguese colonies like Macau or Angola after its independence. The Portuguese were always the largest ethnic group of immigrants to Brazil. In the early years of Portuguese colonization it is estimated that between 1500 and 1800 some 600,000 Portuguese immigrated to Brazil, and then between 1800 and 1980 another 600,000, then from 1980 to the present, 600,000 more. Portuguese immigration to Brazil will always be a constant, hence, will always comprise the largest percentage of European immigrants. By 2030, there will be an estimated 1,000,000 Portuguese total immigrants in Brazil as of 1980, significantly dwarfing all of the other immigrant groups. An additional figure of 1.2 million Portuguese arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast.[71] Nowadays, Lusitanians (Portuguese) constitute the biggest group of foreigners living in the country, with over 700,000 Portuguese nationals currently living in Brazil.[72] The vast majority arrived in the last decade. The first semester of 2011 solely had an increase of 52 thousand Portuguese nationals applying for a permanent residence visa while another large group was granted Brazilian citizenship.[73][74]\n* Spaniards came in large numbers to Brazil, starting in the late 19th century. Most of them were attracted to work in the coffee plantations in the state of São Paulo. An estimated 15 million Brazilians are of direct Spanish descent.[75]\n* Ukrainians came mostly in the late 19th century. Currently they number approximately 980,000, most of whom live in a compact settlement in south central Paraná.[76]\n\n\nSee also: Dutch Brazilian, German Brazilian, Italian Brazilian, Polish Brazilian, Portuguese Brazilian, Spanish Brazilian, and Ukrainian Brazilian\n\n### Mixed-race/Pardo-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pardo Brazilians\n\nThe Pardos can be a mixture of Europeans, Levantine, Crypto-Jews or Anusim, Africans, Amerindians, Roma and Asians. Brazil does not have a category for multiracial people, but a Pardo (brown) one, which may include caboclos, mulatos, cafuzos (local ethnonyms for people of noticeable mixed European and Amerindian, African and European, and Amerindian and African descent, i.e., mestizos, mulattoes and zambos, respectively), the multiracial result of their intermixing (despite most of European and African Brazilians possessing some degree of race-mixing, since brownness in Brazil is a matter of phenotype) and assimilated, westernized indigenous people.[77][78]\n\n\nThe Pardos make up 43.13% or 82.3 million people of Brazil's population. Multiracial Brazilians live in the entire territory of Brazil. Although, according to DNA resources, most Brazilians possess some degree of mixed-race ancestry, less than 45% of the country's population classified themselves as being part of this group due to phenotype.[79]\n\n\nThe caboclo or mestiço population, those whose ancestry is Native and European, revolves around 43 million people or 21% of the population. Genetic studies conducted by the geneticist Sergio D.J. Pena of the Federal University of Minas Gerais have shown that the caboclo population is made of individuals whose DNA ranges from 70% to 90% European (mostly Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French or Italian 1500s to 1700s male settlers) with the remaining percentage spanning different Indigenous markers.\n\n\nSimilar DNA tests showed that people self-classified as mulatto or European and African mix, span from 62% to 83% European (mostly descendants of Portuguese, Dutch and French settlers during the colonial period in the Northeast). The pardo category in Brazil also includes 800 thousand Roma people, most of them coming from Portugal but also different countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Eurasians can also be classified as pardo. The majority of them consisting of Ainoko or Hafu, individuals of Japanese and European ancestry.\n\n\nResearch has suggested that Asians from the early Portuguese Eastern Empire, known as Luso-Asians first came to Brazil during the sixteenth century as seamen known as Lascars, or as servants, slaves and concubines accompanying the governors, merchants and clergy who has served in Portuguese Asia.[80] This first presence of Asians was limited to Northeast Brazil, especially Bahia, but others were brought as cultivators, textile workers and miners to Pará and other parts of the Northeast.\n\n\n\n### African-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Afro-Brazilians\n\nAfrican-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely, or mostly, descended from former African slaves, or immigrants. According to the 2010 census, there are 14,517,961 Black Brazilians, about 7.6% of the population.[81]\n\n\nAlthough the majority of Brazilians have at least some degree of African heritage, the racial makeup of black Brazilians themselves is very mixed and mostly of them have a significant degree of white admixture with a minor indigenous component, the range of white admixture for Afro-Brazilians is typically between 30% and 70%; \"pure\" black Brazilians with more than 80% of their genes coming from African ancestry are a subgroup minority.[79]\n\n\n\n### Asian-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asian Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2006 census, people of East Asian descent number 1,919,000, or 1.1% of Brazil's population. Estimates say that there are 2.5 to 3.0 million people of Japanese descent in Brazil, who are mostly concentrated in two states: São Paulo and Paraná, but smaller communities are found in the entire territory of the country. Brazil has the largest population of Japanese descent outside Japan.[82]\n\n\nThere are also smaller communities of Korean people and Chinese origin.[83] Some Chinese, especially from Macau, speak a Portuguese-based creole language called Macanese (patuá or macaísta), aside from Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese. Japanese immigration to Brazil started on 18 June 1908, when the Japanese ship Kasato-Maru arrived in the Port of Santos, south of São Paulo, carrying the first 781 people to take advantage of a bilateral agreement promoting immigration.\n\n\nHalf of them were from the southern part of the Okinawa Island, located about 640 km (400 miles) south of the rest of Japan, which had its own distinct language and culture dating back to before the island's annexation by Tokyo in 1879. The names on shop fronts are in Japanese and selling everything from Japanese food and kitchen utensils to traditional home decorations. Red painted archways, Japanese temples and a Japanese garden are present in this little Japanese corner of Brazil.\n\n\n\n### Aboriginal-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples in Brazil\n\nThe Amerindians make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 700,000 people. Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Centre-Western part of the country. Over 60 million Brazilians possess at least one Native South American ancestor, according to a mitochondrial DNA study.[84]\n\n\nHowever, only 0.4% of the population consider themselves to be Natives. Brazilians tend to consider \"Native South American\" a cultural, not racial category. When the first Portuguese arrived in Brazil, in 1500, there were between 2.5 and 3.2 million Natives living in the country. In the mid-19th century they were only 100,000 and in the late 20th century close to 300,000.\n\n\n\n## Genetic studies[edit]\n\n\nGenetic studies have shown the Brazilian population as a whole to have European, African and Native American components.\n\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA studies[edit]\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal DNA genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 58%\n | 27%\n | 15%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study (2011), with nearly 1000 samples from every major race group (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\", according to their respective proportions) all over the country found out a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component.[86]\n\n\n\"In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South\". The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil[87]), and also public health institutions personnel and health students.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Region[86] | European\n | African\n | Native American\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Northern Brazil | 68.80%\n | 10.50%\n | 18.50%\n |\n| Northeast Brazil | 69.10%\n | 18.30%\n | 12.40%\n |\n| Southeast Brazil | 74.20%\n | 17.30%\n | 7.30%\n |\n| Southern Brazil | 79.50%\n | 10.30%\n | 9.40%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban\npopulations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.[88]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[89] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 17%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 26%\n | 13%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 58%\n | 26%\n | 16%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 61%\n | 27%\n | 12%\n |\n| South Region | 74%\n | 15%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile: \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\".[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[91] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 60.6%\n | 21.3%\n | 18.1%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 68.3%\n | 21.1%\n | 10.6%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 66.3%\n | 21.7%\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 60.7%\n | 32.0%\n | 7.3%\n |\n| South Region | 81.5%\n | 9.3%\n | 9.2%\n |\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 23%\n | 16%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nPairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations\".[92]\n\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.80%) and the Native American (9.3%).[93]\n\n\nSão Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American.[94] A study from 2013 found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American.[95] Another study focused on highly admixed populations yielded similar results.[96]\n\n\n\n## Races and ethnicities by region[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Brazil socio-geographic division\n\n### South[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Centro-Sul\n\nThe South of Brazil is the region with the largest percentage of Europeans. According to the 2005 census, people of European ancestry account for 87% of the population.[82] In colonial times, this region had a very small population.\n\n\nThe region what is now Southern Brazil was originally settled by Amerindian peoples, mostly Guarani and Kaingangs.[97] Only a few settlers from São Paulo were living there. This situation made the region vulnerable to attacks from neighboring countries. This fact forced the King of Portugal to decide to populate the region. For this, settlers from the Portuguese Azores islands were sent to the coast in 1617.[98]\n\n\nTo stimulate the immigration to Brazil, the king offered several benefits for the Azorean couples. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Portuguese from the Azores moved to the coast of Santa Catarina. They were mainly newly married who were seeking a better life. At that time, the Azores were one of the poorest regions of Portugal.\n\n\nThey established themselves mainly in the Santa Catarina Island, nowadays the region of Florianópolis. Later, some couples moved to Rio Grande do Sul, where they established Porto Alegre, the capital. The Azoreans lived on fishing and agriculture, especially flour. They composed over half of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina's population in the late 18th century.[99] The state of Paraná was settled by colonists from São Paulo due to their proximity (Paraná was part of São Paulo until the mid-19th century).\n\n\nWith the development of cattle in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, African slaves began arriving in large numbers. By 1822, Africans were 50% of Rio Grande do Sul's population. This number decreased to 25% in 1858 and to only 5.2% in 2005. Most of them came from Angola.[100]\n\n\nAfter independence from Portugal (1822) the Brazilian government started to stimulate the arrival of a new wave of immigrants to settle the South. In 1824 they established São Leopoldo, a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From Rhineland-Palatinate, the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers.[101]\n\n\nTo attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of São Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at São Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of Novo Hamburgo (*New Hamburg*).[102]\n\n\nFrom São Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of Rio Grande do Sul, mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country (Ragamuffin War). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were Blumenau, in 1850, and Joinville in 1851, both in Santa Catarina state; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region.\nIn the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside.[103] By 1914, it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state.\n\n\nAnother immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul (Serra Gaúcha). These were Garibaldi and Bento Gonçalves. These immigrants were predominantly from Veneto, in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, Caxias do Sul. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of Rio Grande do Sul seeking further opportunities.[104]\n\n\nThey created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native *gaúchos*. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in Santa Catarina, which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as Criciúma, and later also spread further north, to Paraná.\n\n\nA significant number of Poles have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869 and until 1959, it is estimated that over 100,000 Poles migrated to Brazil,[105] 95% of whom were peasants. The State of Paraná received the majority of Polish immigrants, who settled mainly in the region of Curitiba, in the towns of Mallet, Cruz Machado, São Matheus do Sul, Irati, and União da Vitória.[106]\n\n\n\n### Southeast[edit]\n\n\nThe Southeastern region of Brazil is the most ethnically diverse part of the country. Europeans make up 55.16% of its population, those of mixed-race 35.69%, and African descent 7.91%. It has the largest percentage of Asian Brazilians, composing 0.8%, and a small Amerindian community (0.2%).\n\n\nSoutheast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese village in the Americas, São Vicente, São Paulo, established in 1532.[107] The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a melting pot of Africans, Natives, and Europeans. The Indigenous peoples of the region were enslaved by the Portuguese.\n\n\nThe race mixing between the indigenous females and their European masters produced the Bandeirante, the colonial inhabitant of São Paulo, who formed expeditions that crossed the interior of Brazil and greatly increased the Portuguese colonial territory. The main language spoken by these people of mixed Indian/Portuguese heritage was Língua geral, a language that mixed Tupi and Portuguese words.\n\n\nIn the late 17th century the Bandeirantes found gold in the area that nowadays is Minas Gerais. A gold rush took place in Brazil and thousands of Portuguese colonists arrived during this period. The confrontation between the Bandeirantes and the Portuguese for obtaining possession of the mines led to the Emboabas' War.\n\n\nThe Portuguese won the war. The Amerindian culture declined, giving space to a stronger Portuguese cultural domination. In order to control the wealth, the Portuguese Crown moved the capital of Brazil from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of African slaves were brought to work in the gold mines.\n\n\nThey were landed in Rio de Janeiro and sent to other regions. By the late 18th century, Rio de Janeiro was an \"African city\": most of its inhabitants were slaves. No other place in the world had as many slaves since the end of the Roman Empire.[108] In 1808 the Portuguese royal family, fleeing from Napoleon, took charge in Rio de Janeiro. Some 15,000 Portuguese nobles moved to Brazil. The region changed a lot, becoming more European.\n\n\nAfter independence and principally after 1850, Southeast Brazil was \"inundated\" by European immigrants, who were attracted by the government to replace the African slaves in the coffee plantations. Most immigrants landed in the Port of Santos and have been forwarded to the coffee farms within São Paulo.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the immigrants came from Italy. Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. The large number of Italians are visible in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas. For example, Northeast São Paulo is 45% Italian.[109]\n\n\nThe arrival of immigrants from several parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population. The city of Bastos, in São Paulo, is 11.4% Japanese. The city of São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself.\n[110]\n\n\n\n### Northeast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Nordeste (socio-geographic division)\n\nThe population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as \"Pardo\" (Multiracial) make up 60.5% of the population. Those reported as African account for 5.9%.\n\n\nThis region did not have much effect from the massive European immigration that took place in Southern Brazil in the late 19th century and first decades of the 20th century. The Northeast has been a poorer region of Brazil since the decline of sugar cane plantations in the late 17th century, so its economy did not require immigrants.\n\n\nThe ethnic composition of the population starts in the 16th century. The Portuguese settlers rarely brought women, which led to relationships with the Indian women. Later, interracial relationships occurred between Portuguese males and African females. The coast, in the past the place where millions of African slaves arrived (mostly from modern-day Angola, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin) to work in sugar-cane plantations, is where nowadays there is a predominance of Mulattoes, those of African and European ancestry. Salvador, Bahia is considered the largest African city outside of Africa, with over 80% of its inhabitants being African-Brazilians. In the interior, there is a predominance of Indian and European mixture.[111]\n\n\n\n### North[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Amazônia Legal\n\nNorthern Brazil, largely covered by the Amazon rainforest, is the Brazilian region with the largest Amerindian influences, both in culture and ethnicity. Inhabited by diverse indigenous tribes, this part of Brazil was reached by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 17th century, but it started to be populated by non-Indians only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exploitation of rubber used in the growing industries of automobiles, has emerged a huge migration to the region.\n\n\nMany people from the poor Northeast Brazil, mostly Ceará, moved to the Amazon area. The contact between the Indians and the northeastern rubbers created the base of the ethnic composition of the region, with its mixed-race majority.\n\n\n\n### Central-West[edit]\n\n\nThe Central-West region of Brazil was inhabited by diverse Indians when the Portuguese arrived in the early 18th century. The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.\n\n\n\n## Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Health care in Brazil\n\nThe Federal Constitution of 1988 and the 1996 *General Law of Education in Brazil* (LDB) attributed to the Federal Government, states, Federal District and municipalities the responsibility of managing the Brazilian educational system, considering three educational public systems as a basis for collaboration between these federal systems.\n\n\nEach of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as mechanisms and sources for financial resources. The new Constitution reserves 25% of state and municipal taxes and 18% of federal taxes for education.[112]\n\n\nAs set out by the Brazilian Constitution, the main responsibility for basic education is attributed to the states and municipalities. Hence, a historical feature of Brazilian basic education is its extremely decentralized nature, which gives great organizational autonomy to sub-national governments (27 states and 5,546 municipalities) in organizing their educational systems.\n\n\nEarly childhood education, from 0–6 years, is under exclusive responsibility of the municipalities. Responsibility for compulsory primary education from 1st to 9th grades is shared between states and municipalities. Kindergarten and pre-school education are the responsibility of local levels of government, whereas secondary schools are under the responsibility of the states.\n\n\nMaintenance of the system, including salaries, the definition of teacher career structures and supervision of early childhood, primary, and secondary levels (which make up basic education) is decentralized, and these levels are responsible for defining their respective curriculum content.\n\n\nHigher education starts with undergraduate or sequential courses, which may offer different specialization choices such as academic or vocational paths. Depending on the choice, students may improve their educational background with *Stricto Sensu* or *Lato Sensu* postgraduate courses.\n\n\nHigher education has three main purposes: teaching, research and extension, each with their own specific contribution to make to a particular course. Diplomas and certificates are proof of having passed through higher education.\n\n\nAccording to Brazilian Government, the most serious health problems are:[113]\n\n\n\n* Childhood mortality: about 2.51% of childhood mortality, reaching 3.77% in the northeast region.\n* Motherhood mortality: about 73.1 deaths per 100,000 born children in 2002.\n* Mortality by non-transmissible illness: 151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by heart and circulatory diseases, along with 72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by cancer.\n* Mortality caused by external causes (transportation, violence and suicide): 71.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (14.9% of all deaths in the country), reaching 82.3 deaths in the southeast region.\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Brazil\n\nAccording to the IBGE census 2010[114] 64.6% are Roman Catholics; 24% are Protestants and other Christians, 8% are agnostics, atheists or have no religion, 2% are followers of Spiritism, and 1% are members of other religions. Some of these religions are Jehovah's Witnesses (1,100,000), Latter-day Saints (200,000), Buddhism (215,000), Judaism (86,000), and Islam (27,000).[115]\n\n\nBrazil has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world.[116]\n\n\nFollowers of Protestantism are rising in number. Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were adherents of \"traditional churches\", mostly Lutherans, Presbyterians and Baptists. There are 120,000 Episcopalians in 9 dioceses (Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil). Since then, numbers of Pentecostal and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.\n\n\nIslam in Brazil was first practiced by African slaves.[117] The Muslim population in Brazil is made up mostly of Arab immigrants.[118]\n\n\nThe largest population of Buddhists in Latin America lives in Brazil, due greatly to Brazil's large Japanese population.\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Brazil and Portuguese language\n\nPortuguese is the only official language of Brazil.[119] It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio, TV and for all business and administrative purposes. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity.\n\n\nMany Amerindian languages are spoken daily in indigenous communities, primarily in Northern Brazil. Although many of these communities have significant contact with Portuguese,[120] there are incentives stimulating preservation and the teaching of native languages. According to SIL International, 133 Native American languages are currently endangered. Some of the largest indigenous language groups include Arawak, Carib, Macro-Gê and Tupi.[121] In 2006, the City of São Gabriel da Cachoeira in the region of Cabeça do Cachorro (Northwestern region of the State of Amazonas), has adopted some indigenous languages as some of its other official languages along with Portuguese.\n\n\nOther languages are spoken by descendants of immigrants, who are usually bilingual, in small rural communities in Southern Brazil. The most important are the Brazilian German dialects, such as Riograndenser Hunsrückisch and the East Pomeranian dialect, and also the Talian, based on the Italian Venetian language. There are also bilingual speakers of Polish, Ukrainian and Russian in Southern Brazil, especially Paraná. In the city of São Paulo, Levantine, Japanese, Chinese and Korean can be heard in the immigrant neighborhoods, such as Liberdade. Yiddish and Hebrew are used by Jewish communities mainly in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Brasília, Belo Horizonte and Recife as well as the Vlax Romani dialect by Romani communities all across the nation.\n\n\n\n## *The World Factbook* demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from *The World Factbook*, unless otherwise indicated[122]\n\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\n* noun: Brazilian(s)\n* adjective: Brazilian\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n* 217,650,530\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n* Portuguese (official)\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n* European | mainly Portuguese 47.6%\n* Caboclo, Castizo 23.1%\n* Mulatto, Quadroon, Octoroon 21%\n* Black Brazilians 7.0%\n* Asian (mainly Japanese) 1.2%\n* Indigenous 0.4%\n* Romani 0.4%\n* Eurasian, Hafu 0.3%\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\n* Total population: 94.4%\n* Male: 92.4%\n* Female: 96.4% (2019 est.)\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\n* Roman Catholic 64.6%\n* Other Catholic 0.4%\n* Protestant 22.2%\n\t+ Adventist (including Seventh-day Adventist and Adventist Church of Promise) 6.5%\n\t+ Assembly of God 2.0%\n\t+ Christian Congregation of Brazil 1.2%\n\t+ Universal Church of the Kingdom of God 1.0%\n\t+ Other Protestant 11.5%\n\t+ Other Christian 0.7%\n* Spiritist 2.2%\n* Other 1.4%\n* None 8%\n* Unspecified 0.4%\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Brazil\n* 2022 Brazilian census\n* Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n* Demographics of Rio de Janeiro\n* List of largest cities in Brazil\n* Racial democracy\n* *Brazilian Journal of Population Studies*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** População do Brasil – IBGE\n2. **^** \"Censo Demográfi co 20200 Características da população e dos domicílios Resultados do universo\" (PDF). 8 November 2021.

Ethnic Vietnamese, or Viet (known officially as Kinh), live in the lowlands and speak the Vietnamese language, as opposed to the many ethnic groups of Vietnam who are known to occupy the mountainous regions. The Kinh group does represent much of the cultural and political landscape of Vietnam. \n\n\nVietnam's population may be expected to approach to 100 million by the end of 2023, making it the 15th largest country by population in the world. [6] [7] It is predicted that by 2035, Vietnam will become an aged society.

Note: map situation has now changed due to internal migration.\nThe Vietnamese government recognizes 54 ethnic groups, of which the Viet (Kinh) is the largest; according to official Vietnamese figures (2019 census), ethnic Vietnamese account for 85.32% of the nation's population and the non-Vietnamese ethnic groups account for the remaining percent. The ethnic Vietnamese inhabit a little less than half of Vietnam, while the ethnic minorities inhabit the majority of Vietnam's land (albeit the least fertile parts of the country).\n\n\nThe relation between China and Vietnam also declined following reunification in 1975, with Vietnam siding with the Soviet Union against China in the Chinese-Soviet split. Tensions peaked when Vietnam and Cambodia started a war, Cambodia lead by Pol Pot being a Chinese ally, resulting in a Chinese invasion of Vietnam in 1979. In 1978-79, some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left Vietnam by boat as refugees (many officially encouraged and assisted) or were expelled across the land border with China. In recent years the government has performed an about turn and is encouraging overseas Hoa to return and invest, but the ethnic Chinese population has been in continuous decline since the 1970s due to assimilation and low birth rates.\n\n\nThe central highland peoples commonly termed Degar or Montagnards (mountain people) comprise two main ethnolinguistic groups--Malayo-Polynesian and Mon–Khmer. About 30 groups of various cultures and dialects are spread over the highland territory.\n\n\nOther minority groups include the Cham—remnants of the once-mighty Champa Kingdom, conquered by the Vietnamese in the 15th century, Hmong, and Thái.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Population of Vietnam according to ethnic group 1989-2019**\n| Ethnicgroup\n | Language family\n | census 1989[17] | census 1999[18] |

It belongs to the Austroasiatic language family, which also includes languages such as Khmer and Mon. Vietnamese was spoken by 85-90 million people in Vietnam at the 1999 census. In the early 21st century, around another four million Vietnamese speakers are found outside of Vietnam, mostly refugees from the Vietnam-American War. Thus Vietnamese is the most spoken language of the Austroasiatic family, being spoken by three times more people than the second most spoken language of the family, Khmer. Both languages, however, are extremely different: Vietnamese is a tonal, monosyllabic language while Khmer has remained non-tonal. Vietnamese was heavily influenced by Chinese, with up to around 50-70% words having Chinese origins, whilst Khmer was heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Pali, uses a abugida writing system, and has a great part of its vocabulary originating from Indian languages. Since the early 20th century, the Vietnamese have used a Romanized script introduced by the French, developed by Jesuit missionaries led by Alexandre de Rhodes and later on, refined by Vietnamese scholars to produce what is now known as the Vietnamese alphabet.\n\n\n\n## Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Vietnam\n\nReligion in Vietnam (2019)[20]\n\n\n\nVietnamese folk religion or non religious (86.32%)\nCatholicism (6.1%)\nBuddhism (4.79%)\nHoahaoism (1.02%)\nProtestantism (1%)\nOthers (0.77%)\n\nAccording to the 2019 Census, the religious demographics of Vietnam are as follows:[20]\n\n\n\n* 86.32% Vietnamese folk religion or non religious\n* 6.1% Catholicism\n* 4.79% Buddhism (mainly Mahayana)\n* 1.02% Hoahaoism\n* 1% Protestantism\n* <1% Caodaism\n* 0.77 Others\n\n\nIt is worth noting here that the data is highly skewered, as a large majority of Vietnamese may declare themselves atheist yet practice forms of traditional folk religion or Mahayana Buddhism.[21]\n\n\nEstimates for the year 2010 published by the Pew Research Center:[22]\n\n\n\n* Vietnamese folk religion, 45.3%\n* Unaffiliated, 29.6%\n* Buddhism, 16.4%\n* Christianity, 8.2%\n* Other, 0.5%\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid 2017\n![](image)Life expectancy in Vietnam since 1950\n![](image)Life expectancy in Vietnam since 1960 by gender\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n### Sex ratio[edit]\n\n\nat birth: 1.07 male(s)/female\nunder 15 years: 1.08 male(s)/female\n15–64 years: 0.98 male(s)/female\n65 years and over: 0.63 male(s)/female\ntotal population: 0.98 male(s)/female\n(2008 est.)\n\n\nSource: Statista etc.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Life expectancy inYears\n | Period\n | Life expectancy inYears\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1955–1960\n | 57.3\n | 1990–1995\n | 71.2\n |\n| 1960–1965\n | 60.5\n | 1995–2000\n | 72.7\n |\n| 1965–1970\n | 62.3\n | 2000–2005\n | 73.8\n |\n| 1970–1975\n | 57.8\n | 2005–2010\n | 74.7\n |\n| 1975–1980\n | 66.1\n | 2010–2015\n | 75.6\n |\n| 1980–1985\n | 68.1\n |  |  |\n\n\nSource: *UN World Population Prospects*[25]\n\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 95.6% (2014 census); 95.8% (2019 census)\nmale: 96.9% (no records); 97% (2019 census)\nfemale: 91.9% (2012); 94.6% (2019 census)\nSource: The Worldbank Database etc.[26][27][28][29]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Racism in Vietnam\n* List of ethnic groups in Vietnam\n* Overseas Vietnamese\n\n\n## Sources[edit]\n\n\n* 2006 Vietnam's population estimates\n* 1999 Census results\n* Socioeconomic Atlas of Vietnam\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** [1], 28 December 2015.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** General Statistics Office of Vietnam (2023). *Niên giám Thống kê Việt Nam năm 2022* [*Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2022*] (PDF).

Ethnic Vietnamese, or Viet (known officially as Kinh), live in the lowlands and speak the Vietnamese language, as opposed to the many ethnic groups of Vietnam who are known to occupy the mountainous regions. The Kinh group does represent much of the cultural and political landscape of Vietnam. \n\n\nVietnam's population may be expected to approach to 100 million by the end of 2023, making it the 15th largest country by population in the world. [6] [7] It is predicted that by 2035, Vietnam will become an aged society.

Note: map situation has now changed due to internal migration.\nThe Vietnamese government recognizes 54 ethnic groups, of which the Viet (Kinh) is the largest; according to official Vietnamese figures (2019 census), ethnic Vietnamese account for 85.32% of the nation's population and the non-Vietnamese ethnic groups account for the remaining percent. The ethnic Vietnamese inhabit a little less than half of Vietnam, while the ethnic minorities inhabit the majority of Vietnam's land (albeit the least fertile parts of the country).\n\n\nThe relation between China and Vietnam also declined following reunification in 1975, with Vietnam siding with the Soviet Union against China in the Chinese-Soviet split. Tensions peaked when Vietnam and Cambodia started a war, Cambodia lead by Pol Pot being a Chinese ally, resulting in a Chinese invasion of Vietnam in 1979. In 1978-79, some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left Vietnam by boat as refugees (many officially encouraged and assisted) or were expelled across the land border with China. In recent years the government has performed an about turn and is encouraging overseas Hoa to return and invest, but the ethnic Chinese population has been in continuous decline since the 1970s due to assimilation and low birth rates.\n\n\nThe central highland peoples commonly termed Degar or Montagnards (mountain people) comprise two main ethnolinguistic groups--Malayo-Polynesian and Mon–Khmer. About 30 groups of various cultures and dialects are spread over the highland territory.\n\n\nOther minority groups include the Cham—remnants of the once-mighty Champa Kingdom, conquered by the Vietnamese in the 15th century, Hmong, and Thái.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Population of Vietnam according to ethnic group 1989-2019**\n| Ethnicgroup\n | Language family\n | census 1989[17] | census 1999[18] |

It belongs to the Austroasiatic language family, which also includes languages such as Khmer and Mon. Vietnamese was spoken by 85-90 million people in Vietnam at the 1999 census. In the early 21st century, around another four million Vietnamese speakers are found outside of Vietnam, mostly refugees from the Vietnam-American War. Thus Vietnamese is the most spoken language of the Austroasiatic family, being spoken by three times more people than the second most spoken language of the family, Khmer. Both languages, however, are extremely different: Vietnamese is a tonal, monosyllabic language while Khmer has remained non-tonal. Vietnamese was heavily influenced by Chinese, with up to around 50-70% words having Chinese origins, whilst Khmer was heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Pali, uses a abugida writing system, and has a great part of its vocabulary originating from Indian languages. Since the early 20th century, the Vietnamese have used a Romanized script introduced by the French, developed by Jesuit missionaries led by Alexandre de Rhodes and later on, refined by Vietnamese scholars to produce what is now known as the Vietnamese alphabet.\n\n\n\n## Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Vietnam\n\nReligion in Vietnam (2019)[20]\n\n\n\nVietnamese folk religion or non religious (86.32%)\nCatholicism (6.1%)\nBuddhism (4.79%)\nHoahaoism (1.02%)\nProtestantism (1%)\nOthers (0.77%)\n\nAccording to the 2019 Census, the religious demographics of Vietnam are as follows:[20]\n\n\n\n* 86.32% Vietnamese folk religion or non religious\n* 6.1% Catholicism\n* 4.79% Buddhism (mainly Mahayana)\n* 1.02% Hoahaoism\n* 1% Protestantism\n* <1% Caodaism\n* 0.77 Others\n\n\nIt is worth noting here that the data is highly skewered, as a large majority of Vietnamese may declare themselves atheist yet practice forms of traditional folk religion or Mahayana Buddhism.[21]\n\n\nEstimates for the year 2010 published by the Pew Research Center:[22]\n\n\n\n* Vietnamese folk religion, 45.3%\n* Unaffiliated, 29.6%\n* Buddhism, 16.4%\n* Christianity, 8.2%\n* Other, 0.5%\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid 2017\n![](image)Life expectancy in Vietnam since 1950\n![](image)Life expectancy in Vietnam since 1960 by gender\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n### Sex ratio[edit]\n\n\nat birth: 1.07 male(s)/female\nunder 15 years: 1.08 male(s)/female\n15–64 years: 0.98 male(s)/female\n65 years and over: 0.63 male(s)/female\ntotal population: 0.98 male(s)/female\n(2008 est.)\n\n\nSource: Statista etc.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Life expectancy inYears\n | Period\n | Life expectancy inYears\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1955–1960\n | 57.3\n | 1990–1995\n | 71.2\n |\n| 1960–1965\n | 60.5\n | 1995–2000\n | 72.7\n |\n| 1965–1970\n | 62.3\n | 2000–2005\n | 73.8\n |\n| 1970–1975\n | 57.8\n | 2005–2010\n | 74.7\n |\n| 1975–1980\n | 66.1\n | 2010–2015\n | 75.6\n |\n| 1980–1985\n | 68.1\n |  |  |\n\n\nSource: *UN World Population Prospects*[25]\n\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 95.6% (2014 census); 95.8% (2019 census)\nmale: 96.9% (no records); 97% (2019 census)\nfemale: 91.9% (2012); 94.6% (2019 census)\nSource: The Worldbank Database etc.[26][27][28][29]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Racism in Vietnam\n* List of ethnic groups in Vietnam\n* Overseas Vietnamese\n\n\n## Sources[edit]\n\n\n* 2006 Vietnam's population estimates\n* 1999 Census results\n* Socioeconomic Atlas of Vietnam\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** [1], 28 December 2015.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** General Statistics Office of Vietnam (2023). *Niên giám Thống kê Việt Nam năm 2022* [*Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2022*] (PDF).

Mestizo |  | 87.58% |\n| Black (includes Mulatto, Raizal, and Palenquero) |  | 6.76% |\n| Amerindian |  | 4.31% |\n| Romani |  | 0.006% |\n\nColombia is ethnically diverse, its original people descending from the original native inhabitants, Spanish and European colonists, Africans originally brought to the country as slaves, and 20th-century immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, all contributing to a diverse cultural heritage.[21] The demographic distribution reflects a pattern that is influenced by colonial history. Whites tend to live mainly in urban centers, like Bogotá, Medellín or Cali, and the burgeoning highland cities. The populations of the major cities also include mestizos. Mestizos include artisans and small tradesmen that have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent decades.[22]\n\n\nThe 2005 census (outdated) reported that the \"non-ethnic population\", consisting of whites and mestizos (those of majority Indigenous American ancestry), constituted 86% of the national population. 10.6% is of black ancestry. Indigenous Colombians comprise 3.4% of the population. Less than 0.01% of the population is Roma. An extraofficial estimate considers that the 49% of the Colombian population is Mestizo or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry, and that approximately 19-37% is White, mainly of Spanish lineage, but there is also a large population of Middle East descent; among the upper class there is a considerable input of Italian ancestry.[23]\n\n\nMany of the Indigenous peoples experienced a reduction in population during the Spanish rule[24] and many others were absorbed into the mestizo population, but the remainder currently represents over eighty distinct cultures. Reserves (*resguardos*) established for indigenous peoples occupy 30,571,640 hectares (305,716.4 km2) (27% of the country's total) and are inhabited by more than 800,000 people.[25] Some of the largest indigenous groups are the Wayuu,[26] the Paez, the Pastos, the Emberá and the Zenú.[27] The departments of La Guajira, Cauca, Nariño, Córdoba and Sucre have the largest indigenous populations.[28]\n\n\nThe Organización Nacional Indígena de Colombia (ONIC), founded at the first National Indigenous Congress in 1982, is an organization representing the indigenous peoples of Colombia. In 1991, Colombia signed and ratified the current international law concerning indigenous peoples, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.[29]\n\n\nBlack Africans were brought as slaves, mostly to the coastal lowlands, beginning early in the 16th century and continuing into the 19th century. Large Afro-Colombian communities are found today on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. The population of the department of Chocó, running along the northern portion of Colombia's Pacific coast, is over 70% black.[30] Britons and Jamaicans migrated mainly to the islands of San Andres and Providencia Islands. A number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including people from the former USSR during and after the Second World War.[31][32]\n\n\nMany immigrant communities have settled on the Caribbean coast, in particular recent immigrants from the Middle East. Barranquilla (the largest city of the Colombian Caribbean) and other Caribbean cities have the largest populations of Lebanese, Palestinian, Phoenician and other Middle Easterners.[33][34] There are also important communities of Romanis and Jews.[21] There is a major migration trend of Venezuelans, due to the political crisis and economic collapse in Venezuela.[35]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Colombia\n\nSee also: Colombian Spanish\n\nSpanish (of which Colombia has the third-largest population of speakers in the world after Mexico and the United States) is the official language, and there are small communities in urban areas speaking other European languages such as German, French, English, Italian and Portuguese. There are 65 indigenous languages and two Creole languages, one creole in San Basilio de Palenque and one in San Andrés; and also San Andrés is the only place of Colombia where are three official languages: Spanish, English and a creole language.[36][37][38]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Colombia\n\nReligion in Colombia (2014) – Pew Research Center[39]\n\n\n\nCatholicism (79%)\nProtestantism (13%)\nUnaffiliated (6%)\nOther (2%)\n\nReligion in Colombia – Other studies [40][41]\n\n\n\nCatholicism (70.9%)\nProtestantism (16.7%)\nAtheist or agnostic (4.7%)\nClaim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion (3.5%)\nJehovah's Witnesses and Adventism (1.8%)\nOther (0.2%)\nThe remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. (2.2%)\n\nThe National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies and a survey, about 90% of the population adheres to Christianity, the majority of which (70.9%) are Roman Catholic, while a significant minority (16.7%) adhere to Protestantism (primarily Evangelicalism). Some 4.7% of the population is atheist or agnostic, while 3.5% claim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion. 1.8% of Colombians adhere to Jehovah's Witnesses and Adventism and less than 1% adhere to other religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Mormonism, Hinduism, Indigenous religions, Hare Krishna movement, Rastafari movement, Eastern Orthodox Church, and spiritual studies. The remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. In addition to the above statistics, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their faith actively.[39][40][41]\n\n\nWhile Colombia remains a mostly Roman Catholic country by baptism numbers, the 1991 Colombian constitution guarantees freedom of religion and all religious faiths and churches are equally free before the law.[42]\n\n\n\n## Migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colombian diaspora\n\nHistorically, a sizable percentage of Colombian emigration has also been motivated by the need to escape from political persecution and bipartisan violence during the periods of \"La Violencia\" (1948–1958), and later due to the effects of the nation's current conflict (since 1964). This has resulted in numerous applications for political asylum abroad.\n\n\nColombians have emigrated in comparably high rates to the United States. Other Colombians migrated to Canada and Europe (most to Spain, but also to France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Sweden). Among other locations.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n**Foreign-born population 2018 census**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country of birth\n | 2018[43] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Number\n | %\n |\n| ![](image) Venezuela | 837,900\n | 86.96\n |\n| ![](image) USA | 20,124\n | 2.09\n |\n| ![](image) Ecuador | 18,111\n | 1.88\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 14,954\n | 1.55\n |\n| ![](image) Peru | 5,481\n | 0.57\n |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 5,220\n | 0.54\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 5,088\n | 0.53\n |\n| ![](image) Brazil | 4,218\n | 0.44\n |\n| ![](image) Chile | 4,182\n | 0.43\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 3,104\n | 0.32\n |\n| ![](image) France | 2,954\n | 0.31\n |\n| ![](image) Panama | 2,909\n | 0.30\n |\n| ![](image) Cuba | 2,383\n | 0.25\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 2,133\n | 0.22\n |\n| ![](image) Costa Rica | 1,675\n | 0.17\n |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 1,591\n | 0.17\n |\n| ![](image) Canada | 1,570\n | 0.16\n |\n\n\n**Colombian population living abroad**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country of residency\n | 2020[44] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Number\n | %\n |\n| ![](image) Venezuela | 1,000,000\n | 40.91\n |\n| ![](image) USA | 1,557,000\n | 28.31\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 481,000\n | 8.75\n |\n| ![](image) Ecuador | 279,000\n | 5.07\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 198,500\n | 3.61\n |\n| ![](image) Chile | 135,000\n | 2.45\n |\n| ![](image) Canada | 86,000\n | 1.56\n |\n| ![](image) Panama | 58,350\n | 1.07\n |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 50,000\n | 0.91\n |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 48,000\n | 0.87\n |\n| ![](image) Brasil | 43,500\n | 0.79\n |\n| ![](image) Peru | 40,500\n | 0.73\n |\n| ![](image) Costa Rica | 40,000\n | 0.72\n |\n| ![](image) France | 40,000\n | 0.72\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 24,000\n | 0.44\n |\n| ![](image) Australia | 22,000\n | 0.40\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 20,000\n | 0.36\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 18,000\n | 0.33\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 15,000\n | 0.27\n |\n| ![](image) Bolivia | 13,000\n | 0.24\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 12,000\n | 0.22\n |\n| ![](image) Aruba | 8,000\n | 0.15\n |\n| ![](image) Dominican Republic | 8,000\n | 0.15\n |\n| ![](image) Curacao | 4,500\n | 0.08\n |\n| ![](image) China | 4,000\n | 0.07\n |\n| ![](image) Norway | 4,000\n | 0.07\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | 3,500\n | 0.06\n |\n| ![](image) Israel | 3,500\n | 0.06\n |\n| ![](image) Japan | 3,000\n | 0.05\n |\n| ![](image) UAE | 2,500\n | 0.04\n |\n| ![](image) New Zealand | 2,500\n | 0.04\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 2,500\n | 0.04\n |\n| ![](image) Austria | 2,000\n | 0.03\n |\n| ![](image) Cuba | 2,000\n | 0.03\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | 2,000\n | 0.03\n |\n| ![](image) Uruguay | 2,000\n | 0.03\n |\n| ![](image) Guatemala | 1,500\n | 0.02\n |\n| ![](image) Paraguay | 1,500\n | 0.02\n |\n| ![](image) Honduras | 1,300\n | 0.02\n |\n| ![](image) Nicaragua | 1,200\n | 0.02\n |\n| ![](image) Lebanon | 1,000\n | 0.01\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 1,000\n | 0.01\n |\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Colombia since 1900\n![](image)Life expectancy in Colombia since 1960 by gender\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[45]\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n48,637,910 (May 2016 est.)\n\n\n\n### Median age[edit]\n\n\ntotal: 27.7 years\n\n\nmale: 26.7 years\n\n\nfemale: 28.6 years (2010 est.)\n\n\n\n### Sex ratio[edit]\n\n\nAt birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\n\nUnder 15 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n\n\n15–64 years: 0.95 male(s)/female\n\n\n65 years and over: 0.75 male(s)/female\n\n\ntotal population: 0.96 male(s)/female (2009 est.)\n\n\n\n### HIV/AIDS – adult prevalence rate[edit]\n\n\n0.7% (2007 est.)\n\n\n\n### HIV/AIDS – people living with HIV/AIDS[edit]\n\n\n170,000 (2007 est.)\n\n\n\n### HIV/AIDS – deaths[edit]\n\n\n9,800 (2007 est.)\n\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\nnoun: Colombia\nadjective: Colombian(s)\n\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\n\ntotal population: 99.4%\n\n\nmale: 99.1% (2018 census)\n\n\nfemale: 99.7% (2018 census)\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Colombia portal\n\n\n1. **^** Because of rounding of the individual percentages, the entries in this column may not sum to 100%.\n2. **^** This figure for each department compares to a national increase of 12.5%.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Proyecciones de Población DANE\".\n2. **^** \"CIA – The World Factbook – Rank Order – Net migration rate\".

Mestizo |  | 87.58% |\n| Black (includes Mulatto, Raizal, and Palenquero) |  | 6.76% |\n| Amerindian |  | 4.31% |\n| Romani |  | 0.006% |\n\nColombia is ethnically diverse, its original people descending from the original native inhabitants, Spanish and European colonists, Africans originally brought to the country as slaves, and 20th-century immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, all contributing to a diverse cultural heritage.[21] The demographic distribution reflects a pattern that is influenced by colonial history. Whites tend to live mainly in urban centers, like Bogotá, Medellín or Cali, and the burgeoning highland cities. The populations of the major cities also include mestizos. Mestizos include artisans and small tradesmen that have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent decades.[22]\n\n\nThe 2005 census (outdated) reported that the \"non-ethnic population\", consisting of whites and mestizos (those of majority Indigenous American ancestry), constituted 86% of the national population. 10.6% is of black ancestry. Indigenous Colombians comprise 3.4% of the population. Less than 0.01% of the population is Roma. An extraofficial estimate considers that the 49% of the Colombian population is Mestizo or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry, and that approximately 19-37% is White, mainly of Spanish lineage, but there is also a large population of Middle East descent; among the upper class there is a considerable input of Italian ancestry.[23]\n\n\nMany of the Indigenous peoples experienced a reduction in population during the Spanish rule[24] and many others were absorbed into the mestizo population, but the remainder currently represents over eighty distinct cultures. Reserves (*resguardos*) established for indigenous peoples occupy 30,571,640 hectares (305,716.4 km2) (27% of the country's total) and are inhabited by more than 800,000 people.[25] Some of the largest indigenous groups are the Wayuu,[26] the Paez, the Pastos, the Emberá and the Zenú.[27] The departments of La Guajira, Cauca, Nariño, Córdoba and Sucre have the largest indigenous populations.[28]\n\n\nThe Organización Nacional Indígena de Colombia (ONIC), founded at the first National Indigenous Congress in 1982, is an organization representing the indigenous peoples of Colombia. In 1991, Colombia signed and ratified the current international law concerning indigenous peoples, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.[29]\n\n\nBlack Africans were brought as slaves, mostly to the coastal lowlands, beginning early in the 16th century and continuing into the 19th century. Large Afro-Colombian communities are found today on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. The population of the department of Chocó, running along the northern portion of Colombia's Pacific coast, is over 70% black.[30] Britons and Jamaicans migrated mainly to the islands of San Andres and Providencia Islands. A number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including people from the former USSR during and after the Second World War.[31][32]\n\n\nMany immigrant communities have settled on the Caribbean coast, in particular recent immigrants from the Middle East. Barranquilla (the largest city of the Colombian Caribbean) and other Caribbean cities have the largest populations of Lebanese, Palestinian, Phoenician and other Middle Easterners.[33][34] There are also important communities of Romanis and Jews.[21] There is a major migration trend of Venezuelans, due to the political crisis and economic collapse in Venezuela.[35]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Colombia\n\nSee also: Colombian Spanish\n\nSpanish (of which Colombia has the third-largest population of speakers in the world after Mexico and the United States) is the official language, and there are small communities in urban areas speaking other European languages such as German, French, English, Italian and Portuguese. There are 65 indigenous languages and two Creole languages, one creole in San Basilio de Palenque and one in San Andrés; and also San Andrés is the only place of Colombia where are three official languages: Spanish, English and a creole language.[36][37][38]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Colombia\n\nReligion in Colombia (2014) – Pew Research Center[39]\n\n\n\nCatholicism (79%)\nProtestantism (13%)\nUnaffiliated (6%)\nOther (2%)\n\nReligion in Colombia – Other studies [40][41]\n\n\n\nCatholicism (70.9%)\nProtestantism (16.7%)\nAtheist or agnostic (4.7%)\nClaim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion (3.5%)\nJehovah's Witnesses and Adventism (1.8%)\nOther (0.2%)\nThe remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. (2.2%)\n\nThe National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies and a survey, about 90% of the population adheres to Christianity, the majority of which (70.9%) are Roman Catholic, while a significant minority (16.7%) adhere to Protestantism (primarily Evangelicalism). Some 4.7% of the population is atheist or agnostic, while 3.5% claim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion. 1.8% of Colombians adhere to Jehovah's Witnesses and Adventism and less than 1% adhere to other religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Mormonism, Hinduism, Indigenous religions, Hare Krishna movement, Rastafari movement, Eastern Orthodox Church, and spiritual studies. The remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. In addition to the above statistics, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their faith actively.[39][40][41]\n\n\nWhile Colombia remains a mostly Roman Catholic country by baptism numbers, the 1991 Colombian constitution guarantees freedom of religion and all religious faiths and churches are equally free before the law.[42]\n\n\n\n## Migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colombian diaspora\n\nHistorically, a sizable percentage of Colombian emigration has also been motivated by the need to escape from political persecution and bipartisan violence during the periods of \"La Violencia\" (1948–1958), and later due to the effects of the nation's current conflict (since 1964). This has resulted in numerous applications for political asylum abroad.\n\n\nColombians have emigrated in comparably high rates to the United States. Other Colombians migrated to Canada and Europe (most to Spain, but also to France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Sweden). Among other locations.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n**Foreign-born population 2018 census**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country of birth\n | 2018[43] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Number\n | %\n |\n| ![](image) Venezuela | 837,900\n | 86.96\n |\n| ![](image) USA | 20,124\n | 2.09\n |\n| ![](image) Ecuador | 18,111\n | 1.88\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 14,954\n | 1.55\n |\n| ![](image) Peru | 5,481\n | 0.57\n |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 5,220\n | 0.54\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 5,088\n | 0.53\n |\n| ![](image) Brazil | 4,218\n | 0.44\n |\n| ![](image) Chile | 4,182\n | 0.43\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 3,104\n | 0.32\n |\n| ![](image) France | 2,954\n | 0.31\n |\n| ![](image) Panama | 2,909\n | 0.30\n |\n| ![](image) Cuba | 2,383\n | 0.25\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 2,133\n | 0.22\n |\n| ![](image) Costa Rica | 1,675\n | 0.17\n |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 1,591\n | 0.17\n |\n| ![](image) Canada | 1,570\n | 0.16\n |\n\n\n**Colombian population living abroad**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country of residency\n | 2020[44] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Number\n | %\n |\n| ![](image) Venezuela | 1,000,000\n | 40.91\n |\n| ![](image) USA | 1,557,000\n | 28.31\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 481,000\n | 8.75\n |\n| ![](image) Ecuador | 279,000\n | 5.07\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 198,500\n | 3.61\n |\n| ![](image) Chile | 135,000\n | 2.45\n |\n| ![](image) Canada | 86,000\n | 1.56\n |\n| ![](image) Panama | 58,350\n | 1.07\n |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 50,000\n | 0.91\n |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 48,000\n | 0.87\n |\n| ![](image) Brasil | 43,500\n | 0.79\n |\n| ![](image) Peru | 40,500\n | 0.73\n |\n| ![](image) Costa Rica | 40,000\n | 0.72\n |\n| ![](image) France | 40,000\n | 0.72\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 24,000\n | 0.44\n |\n| ![](image) Australia | 22,000\n | 0.40\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 20,000\n | 0.36\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 18,000\n | 0.33\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 15,000\n | 0.27\n |\n| ![](image) Bolivia | 13,000\n | 0.24\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 12,000\n | 0.22\n |\n| ![](image) Aruba | 8,000\n | 0.15\n |\n| ![](image) Dominican Republic | 8,000\n | 0.15\n |\n| ![](image) Curacao | 4,500\n | 0.08\n |\n| ![](image) China | 4,000\n | 0.07\n |\n| ![](image) Norway | 4,000\n | 0.07\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | 3,500\n | 0.06\n |\n| ![](image) Israel | 3,500\n | 0.06\n |\n| ![](image) Japan | 3,000\n | 0.05\n |\n| ![](image) UAE | 2,500\n | 0.04\n |\n| ![](image) New Zealand | 2,500\n | 0.04\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 2,500\n | 0.04\n |\n| ![](image) Austria | 2,000\n | 0.03\n |\n| ![](image) Cuba | 2,000\n | 0.03\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | 2,000\n | 0.03\n |\n| ![](image) Uruguay | 2,000\n | 0.03\n |\n| ![](image) Guatemala | 1,500\n | 0.02\n |\n| ![](image) Paraguay | 1,500\n | 0.02\n |\n| ![](image) Honduras | 1,300\n | 0.02\n |\n| ![](image) Nicaragua | 1,200\n | 0.02\n |\n| ![](image) Lebanon | 1,000\n | 0.01\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 1,000\n | 0.01\n |\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Colombia since 1900\n![](image)Life expectancy in Colombia since 1960 by gender\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[45]\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n48,637,910 (May 2016 est.)\n\n\n\n### Median age[edit]\n\n\ntotal: 27.7 years\n\n\nmale: 26.7 years\n\n\nfemale: 28.6 years (2010 est.)\n\n\n\n### Sex ratio[edit]\n\n\nAt birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\n\nUnder 15 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n\n\n15–64 years: 0.95 male(s)/female\n\n\n65 years and over: 0.75 male(s)/female\n\n\ntotal population: 0.96 male(s)/female (2009 est.)\n\n\n\n### HIV/AIDS – adult prevalence rate[edit]\n\n\n0.7% (2007 est.)\n\n\n\n### HIV/AIDS – people living with HIV/AIDS[edit]\n\n\n170,000 (2007 est.)\n\n\n\n### HIV/AIDS – deaths[edit]\n\n\n9,800 (2007 est.)\n\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\nnoun: Colombia\nadjective: Colombian(s)\n\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\n\ntotal population: 99.4%\n\n\nmale: 99.1% (2018 census)\n\n\nfemale: 99.7% (2018 census)\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Colombia portal\n\n\n1. **^** Because of rounding of the individual percentages, the entries in this column may not sum to 100%.\n2. **^** This figure for each department compares to a national increase of 12.5%.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Proyecciones de Población DANE\".\n2. **^** \"CIA – The World Factbook – Rank Order – Net migration rate\".

Approximately 55% of Indonesia's population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.\n\n\nDespite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,[3] Indonesia's average population growth per year was over 1.1% for the decade ending in 2020, nearly having 13% population growth for that decade. At this rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the recent population growth continues.[4]\n\n\nIndonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country's birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. The median age was 30.2 years in 2017.[5]\nIndonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Provinces of Indonesia by population

Javanese is the largest group with 100 million people (42%), followed by Sundanese, who number nearly 40 million (15%).\n\n\n\n## Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nReligion in Indonesia (2022)[20]\n\n\n\nIslam (87.02%)\nChristianity (10.49%)\nHinduism (1.69%)\nBuddhism (0.73%)\nFolk/Other (0.04%)\nConfucianism (0.03%)\n\nIndonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation; based on civil registration data in 2022 from Ministry of Home Affairs, 87.02% of Indonesians are Muslims, 10.49% Christians (7.43% Protestants, 3.06% Roman Catholic), 1.69% Hindu, 0.73% Buddhists, 0.03% Confucians and 0.04% other faiths.[20] Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese[21] and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are Chinese.[22]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Indonesia\n\nIndonesian is the official language, but there are many different languages native to Indonesia. According to Ethnologue, there are currently 737 living languages spoken in Indonesia,[23] the most widely spoken being Javanese and Sundanese. In Western New Guinea, there are more than 270 indigenous languages in spoken form.[24][25] Some Chinese varieties, most prominently Min Nan, are also spoken. The public use of Chinese, especially usage of Chinese characters, was dissuaded officially between 1966 and 1998.[26]\n\n\n\n## Literacy[edit]\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\n  \n*total population:* 92.81%\n  \n*male:* 95.5%\n  \n*female:* 90.4% (2011 est.)\n\n\nEducation is free in state schools; it is compulsory for children through to grade 12. Although about 92% of eligible children are enrolled in primary school, a much smaller percentage attend full-time. About 44% of secondary school-age children attend junior high school, and some others of this age group attend vocational schools.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid 2016\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook,[27] unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n**Age structure**\n\n\n\n*0-14 years:* 23.33%\n*15-64 years:* 70.72%\n*65 years and over:* 5.95% (2020 census)[28][29]\n**Median age**\n\n\n\n*total:* 31.1 years\n*male:* 30.5 years\n*female:* 31.8 years (2020 est.)\n**Birth rate**\n\n\n\n15.32 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Death rate**\n\n\n\n6.75 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Population growth rate**\n\n\n\n1.097% (2010 est.)\n1.04% (2012 est.)\n0.86% (2017 est.)\n0.79% (2022 est.)\n**Urbanization**\n\n\n\n*urban population:* 57.9% of total population (2022)\n*rate of urbanisation:* 1.99% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n**Sex ratio**\n\n\n\n*at birth:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*0-14 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*15-24 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*25-54 years:* 0.99 male(s)/female\n*55-64 years:* 0.98 male(s)/female\n*65 years and over:* 0.66 male(s)/female\n*total population:* 1 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n**Infant mortality rate**\n\n\n\n*total:* 19.73 deaths/1,000 live births\n*male:* 22.15 deaths/1,000 live births\n*female:* 17.18 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n**Life expectancy at birth**\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1927\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1960 by gender\n*total population:* 73.08 years\n*male:* 70.86 years\n*female:* 75.4 years (2022 est.)\n**Total fertility rate**\n\n\n\n2.01 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n**HIV/AIDS**\n\n\n\nAdult prevalence rate: 0.4% (2017 est.)\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS: 630,000 (2017 est.)\nHIV/AIDS deaths: 39,000 (2017 est.)\n**Obesity – adult prevalence rate**\n\n\n\n6.9% (2016)\n**Children under the age of 5 years underweight**\n\n\n\n19.9% (2013)\n**Nationality**\n\n\n\n*noun:* Indonesian(s)\n*adjective:* Indonesian\n*Ethnic groups:* Javanese 40.1%, Sundanese 15.5%, Malay 3.7%, Batak 3.6%, Madurese 3%, Betawi 2.9%, Minangkabau 2.7%, Buginese 2.7%, Bantenese 2%, Banjarese 1.7%, Balinese 1.7%, Acehnese 1.4%, Dayak 1.4%, Sasak 1.3%, Chinese 1.2%, other 15% (2010 est.)\n**Religions**\n\n\n\nMuslim 86.7%, Christianity 10.72% (Protestant 7.6% and Roman Catholic 3.12%), Hinduism 1.74%, other 0.8% (includes Buddhist and Confucian), unspecified 0.04% (2018 est.)\n**Languages**\n\n\n\nIndonesian (official, a form of Malay influenced by other languages of Indonesia), local languages (the most widely spoken of which is Javanese).\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n*total:* 11 years\n*male:* 12 years\n*female:* 11 years (2005)\n**Education expenditures**\n\n\n\n2.8% of GDP (2014)\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n\n\n* Census in Indonesia\n* Culture of Indonesia\n* Native Indonesians\n* Overseas Indonesian\n* Transmigration program\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2020\" (PDF) (in Indonesian).

Approximately 55% of Indonesia's population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.\n\n\nDespite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,[3] Indonesia's average population growth per year was over 1.1% for the decade ending in 2020, nearly having 13% population growth for that decade. At this rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the recent population growth continues.[4]\n\n\nIndonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country's birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. The median age was 30.2 years in 2017.[5]\nIndonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Provinces of Indonesia by population

Javanese is the largest group with 100 million people (42%), followed by Sundanese, who number nearly 40 million (15%).\n\n\n\n## Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nReligion in Indonesia (2022)[20]\n\n\n\nIslam (87.02%)\nChristianity (10.49%)\nHinduism (1.69%)\nBuddhism (0.73%)\nFolk/Other (0.04%)\nConfucianism (0.03%)\n\nIndonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation; based on civil registration data in 2022 from Ministry of Home Affairs, 87.02% of Indonesians are Muslims, 10.49% Christians (7.43% Protestants, 3.06% Roman Catholic), 1.69% Hindu, 0.73% Buddhists, 0.03% Confucians and 0.04% other faiths.[20] Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese[21] and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are Chinese.[22]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Indonesia\n\nIndonesian is the official language, but there are many different languages native to Indonesia. According to Ethnologue, there are currently 737 living languages spoken in Indonesia,[23] the most widely spoken being Javanese and Sundanese. In Western New Guinea, there are more than 270 indigenous languages in spoken form.[24][25] Some Chinese varieties, most prominently Min Nan, are also spoken. The public use of Chinese, especially usage of Chinese characters, was dissuaded officially between 1966 and 1998.[26]\n\n\n\n## Literacy[edit]\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\n  \n*total population:* 92.81%\n  \n*male:* 95.5%\n  \n*female:* 90.4% (2011 est.)\n\n\nEducation is free in state schools; it is compulsory for children through to grade 12. Although about 92% of eligible children are enrolled in primary school, a much smaller percentage attend full-time. About 44% of secondary school-age children attend junior high school, and some others of this age group attend vocational schools.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid 2016\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook,[27] unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n**Age structure**\n\n\n\n*0-14 years:* 23.33%\n*15-64 years:* 70.72%\n*65 years and over:* 5.95% (2020 census)[28][29]\n**Median age**\n\n\n\n*total:* 31.1 years\n*male:* 30.5 years\n*female:* 31.8 years (2020 est.)\n**Birth rate**\n\n\n\n15.32 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Death rate**\n\n\n\n6.75 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Population growth rate**\n\n\n\n1.097% (2010 est.)\n1.04% (2012 est.)\n0.86% (2017 est.)\n0.79% (2022 est.)\n**Urbanization**\n\n\n\n*urban population:* 57.9% of total population (2022)\n*rate of urbanisation:* 1.99% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n**Sex ratio**\n\n\n\n*at birth:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*0-14 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*15-24 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*25-54 years:* 0.99 male(s)/female\n*55-64 years:* 0.98 male(s)/female\n*65 years and over:* 0.66 male(s)/female\n*total population:* 1 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n**Infant mortality rate**\n\n\n\n*total:* 19.73 deaths/1,000 live births\n*male:* 22.15 deaths/1,000 live births\n*female:* 17.18 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n**Life expectancy at birth**\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1927\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1960 by gender\n*total population:* 73.08 years\n*male:* 70.86 years\n*female:* 75.4 years (2022 est.)\n**Total fertility rate**\n\n\n\n2.01 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n**HIV/AIDS**\n\n\n\nAdult prevalence rate: 0.4% (2017 est.)\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS: 630,000 (2017 est.)\nHIV/AIDS deaths: 39,000 (2017 est.)\n**Obesity – adult prevalence rate**\n\n\n\n6.9% (2016)\n**Children under the age of 5 years underweight**\n\n\n\n19.9% (2013)\n**Nationality**\n\n\n\n*noun:* Indonesian(s)\n*adjective:* Indonesian\n*Ethnic groups:* Javanese 40.1%, Sundanese 15.5%, Malay 3.7%, Batak 3.6%, Madurese 3%, Betawi 2.9%, Minangkabau 2.7%, Buginese 2.7%, Bantenese 2%, Banjarese 1.7%, Balinese 1.7%, Acehnese 1.4%, Dayak 1.4%, Sasak 1.3%, Chinese 1.2%, other 15% (2010 est.)\n**Religions**\n\n\n\nMuslim 86.7%, Christianity 10.72% (Protestant 7.6% and Roman Catholic 3.12%), Hinduism 1.74%, other 0.8% (includes Buddhist and Confucian), unspecified 0.04% (2018 est.)\n**Languages**\n\n\n\nIndonesian (official, a form of Malay influenced by other languages of Indonesia), local languages (the most widely spoken of which is Javanese).\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n*total:* 11 years\n*male:* 12 years\n*female:* 11 years (2005)\n**Education expenditures**\n\n\n\n2.8% of GDP (2014)\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n\n\n* Census in Indonesia\n* Culture of Indonesia\n* Native Indonesians\n* Overseas Indonesian\n* Transmigration program\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2020\" (PDF) (in Indonesian).

Mestizos[edit]\n\n\nMestizos (meaning mixed European and Amerindian) have been reported by the CIA World Factbook to be about 87% of the population of Honduras.[13] As in other Latin American countries, the question of racial breakdown of a national population is contentious. Since the beginning of the 20th century at least, Honduras has publicly framed itself as a mestizo nation, along other Latin American countries such as Guatemala or Mexico, ignoring and at times disparaging both the European component of the population and the surviving Amerindian population that was still regarded as \"pure blood\". It's well known that many Hondurans of European or almost entirely Amerindian background consider themselves mestizo.[14][15]\n\n\nBecause of social stigmas attached, many Honduran people denied having African ancestry, and after African descended Caribbean workers arrived in Honduras, an active campaign to denigrate all people of African descent, made persons of mixed race anxious to deny any African ancestry. Hence official statistics quite uniformly under-represent those people who have ancestry in favor of a \"two race\" solution.[14]\n\n\nExamples of Honduran mestizos are, Poet Clemetina Suarez, novelist and poet Roberto Sosa, footballer Noel Valladares and former president Manuel Zelaya.\n\n\n\n#### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Jose Trinidad Reyes, Founder of the National University](image)\n\nJose Trinidad Reyes, Founder of the National University\n* ![Writer and poet, Rigoberto Paredes.](image)\n\nWriter and poet, Rigoberto Paredes.\n* ![Novelist, Roberto Sosa](image)\n\nNovelist, Roberto Sosa\n* ![Footballer, Noél Valladares](image)\n\nFootballer, Noél Valladares\n\n\n### Amerindian[edit]\n\n\nThe Amerindian population is the largest minority group in Honduras. The largest Amerindian group are the Lencan people. These people have been living in Honduran territory since before the colonization of the Americas, developing their own societies and civilizations. They still have many communities across the country. According to the 2001 census the Amerindian population in Honduras included 381,495 people (6.3% of the total population).[16] With the exception of the Lenca and the Ch'orti' they still keep their language.\n\n\nSix different Amerindian groups were counted at the 2001 census:\n\n\n\n* the Lenca (279,507 in 2001;4.6% of the total population) living in the La Paz, Intibucá, and Lempira departments;\n* the Miskito (51,607 in 2001; 0.8%) living on the northeast coast along the border with Nicaragua.\n* the Ch'orti' (34,453 in 2001;0.6% of the total population), a Mayan group living in the northwest on the border with Guatemala;\n* the Tolupan (also called Jicaque, \"Xicaque\", or Tol; 9,617 in 2001; 0.2% of the total population), living in the reserve of the Montaña de la Flor and parts of the department of Yoro;\n* the Pech or Paya Indians (3,848 in 2001; 0.1% of the total population) living in a small area in the Olancho department;\n* the Mayangna or Tawahka (2,463 in 2001; <0.1%)\n\n\nExamples of Honduran natives are the many Mayan rules of Copan and other Mayan cities, native leaders as Lempira and Cicumba, and environmental and feminist activist Berta Cáceres.\n\n\n\n#### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Copan founder, king Knich Yax Kuk Moo](image)\n\nCopan founder, king Knich Yax Kuk Moo\n* ![Mayan ruler, Kʼakʼ Yipyaj Chan Kʼawiil](image)\n\nMayan ruler, Kʼakʼ Yipyaj Chan Kʼawiil\n* ![Lencan ruler, Lempira](image)\n\nLencan ruler, Lempira\n* ![Lencan environmental activist, Berta Cáceres](image)\n\nLencan environmental activist, Berta Cáceres\n\n\n### African[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Afro-Honduran\n\nThe Afro-Honduran population consist of people of African descent, Garifuna and Creoles. Most of them are descendants of African people brought by the Spanish and other European colonizers between the 16th and 18th centuries. Many of them came from the west African coast, from places like Angola or Senegambia, where European bought slaves for their colonies, while others came from the other colonies in the Caribbean. \n\n\n\n* The Garifuna are descendants of Carib, Arawak, and West African people. This ethnic group has its origins in a group from St. Vincent islands in the Caribbean, who came in 1797. At the 2001 census 46,448 people were registered as Garifuna, 0.8% of the total population of Honduras.[16] The Garifuna speak an Arawakan language. They live along the entire Caribbean coastline of Honduras, and in the Bay Islands.\n* The number of Creoles was 12,370 (0.2%) in 2001.\n\n\nExamples of well-known Afro-Hondurans are footballers David Suazo, Victor \"Muma\" Bernardez, Dr. Emet Cherefant, and Wilson Palacios.\n\n\n\n#### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Footballer, David Suazo](image)\n\nFootballer, David Suazo\n* ![Footballer, Wilson Palacios](image)\n\nFootballer, Wilson Palacios\n\n\n### European[edit]\n\n\nHonduras of European descent or White Hondurans, along with Afro-descendants and Amerindians belong to the minorities of Honduras. Most of the white population are descendants of the Spanish colonists, who mainly came from southern Spain,[*citation needed*] and inhabit most of the western part of the country. Other populations include descendants of European immigrants who arrived at the beginning of the 20th century. In 2014, there were about 14,000 Hondurans of Italian descent, while there were around 400 Italian citizens.[17] Percentages of whites varied between 4% and 9%,[*citation needed*] due to the fact that the majority of Hondurans identify themselves as mestizos, regardless of their ethnic and racial category. Which makes it more difficult to study the number of people who fit into the white category in Honduras. In a census a total of 450,000 of people from Honduras have appeared who identify themselves as whites, therefore it gives the percentage is 4%.\n\n\nHowever, other studies report that the percentage could rise much more, reaching close to a half a million white people in Honduras, which according to official national sources would make a percentage of between 5% and 6.9% of whites in Hondurans.[*citation needed*] This is because the majority of whites in Honduras do not identify themselves as Euro-descendants as such, adopting and feeling more identified with the mestizo identity.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nExamples of white Hondurans are ex president Simon Azcona del Hoyo, pharmacologist Salvador Moncada, film director Juan Carlos Fanconi, politician Roberto Micheletti, General Florencio Xatruch and former president of the Central American federation Don Francisco Morazán Quezada.\n\n\n\n#### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Central American president, General Francisco Morazán](image)\n\nCentral American president, General Francisco Morazán\n* ![General, Florencio Xatruch](image)\n\nGeneral, Florencio Xatruch\n* ![Ex-President, Francisco Bertrand](image)\n\nEx-President, Francisco Bertrand\n* ![Sir.

A lawyer of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH) stated that the Chinese community in Honduras is rather small. Many of the Chinese are immigrants who arrived from China after the revolution and their descendants.[18]\n\n\n\n* ![Hajime Waki, Honduran-japanese singer.](image)\n\nHajime Waki, Honduran-japanese singer.\n\n\n#### Arabs[edit]\n\n\nHonduras hosts a significant Palestinian community (the vast majority of whom are Christian Arabs).[19] These Arab-Hondurans are sometimes called \"Turcos\", because they arrived in Honduras using Turkish travel documents, as their homeland was then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. The Palestinians arrived in the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, establishing themselves especially in the city of San Pedro Sula.[20] As mentioned earlier, they are also considered whites in the country's censuses, in total the Arab-Hondurans make up 3% of the Honduran population.\n\n\n\n#### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Businessman Miguel Facusse, son of immigrants from the Ottoman empire](image)\n\nBusinessman Miguel Facusse, son of immigrants from the Ottoman empire\n* ![TV host Salvador Nasralla, son of Palestinian immigrants](image)\n\nTV host Salvador Nasralla, son of Palestinian immigrants\n* ![Dr Kerim Gattas Asfura, of Arab descent](image)\n\nDr Kerim Gattas Asfura, of Arab descent\n\n\n## Other sources of demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nDemographic statistics below are based on the 2022 World Population Review.[21]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 3 minutes\n* One death every 12 minutes\n* One net migrant every 96 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 3 minutes\n\n\nDemographic statistics below are based on the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[22]\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n9,459,440 (2022 est.)\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMestizo (mixed Amerindian and European) 90%, Amerindian 7%, African descent 2%, White 1%\n\n\n\n### Age structure[edit]\n\n\n*0-14 years:* 30.2% (male 1,411,537/female 1,377,319)\n*15-24 years:* 21.03% (male 969,302/female 972,843)\n*25-54 years:* 37.79% (male 1,657,260/female 1,832,780)\n*55-64 years:* 5.58% (male 233,735/female 281,525)\n*65 years and over:* 5.4% (male 221,779/female 277,260) (2020 est.)\n### Birth rate[edit]\n\n\n17.92 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)

Mestizos[edit]\n\n\nMestizos (meaning mixed European and Amerindian) have been reported by the CIA World Factbook to be about 87% of the population of Honduras.[13] As in other Latin American countries, the question of racial breakdown of a national population is contentious. Since the beginning of the 20th century at least, Honduras has publicly framed itself as a mestizo nation, along other Latin American countries such as Guatemala or Mexico, ignoring and at times disparaging both the European component of the population and the surviving Amerindian population that was still regarded as \"pure blood\". It's well known that many Hondurans of European or almost entirely Amerindian background consider themselves mestizo.[14][15]\n\n\nBecause of social stigmas attached, many Honduran people denied having African ancestry, and after African descended Caribbean workers arrived in Honduras, an active campaign to denigrate all people of African descent, made persons of mixed race anxious to deny any African ancestry. Hence official statistics quite uniformly under-represent those people who have ancestry in favor of a \"two race\" solution.[14]\n\n\nExamples of Honduran mestizos are, Poet Clemetina Suarez, novelist and poet Roberto Sosa, footballer Noel Valladares and former president Manuel Zelaya.\n\n\n\n#### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Jose Trinidad Reyes, Founder of the National University](image)\n\nJose Trinidad Reyes, Founder of the National University\n* ![Writer and poet, Rigoberto Paredes.](image)\n\nWriter and poet, Rigoberto Paredes.\n* ![Novelist, Roberto Sosa](image)\n\nNovelist, Roberto Sosa\n* ![Footballer, Noél Valladares](image)\n\nFootballer, Noél Valladares\n\n\n### Amerindian[edit]\n\n\nThe Amerindian population is the largest minority group in Honduras. The largest Amerindian group are the Lencan people. These people have been living in Honduran territory since before the colonization of the Americas, developing their own societies and civilizations. They still have many communities across the country. According to the 2001 census the Amerindian population in Honduras included 381,495 people (6.3% of the total population).[16] With the exception of the Lenca and the Ch'orti' they still keep their language.\n\n\nSix different Amerindian groups were counted at the 2001 census:\n\n\n\n* the Lenca (279,507 in 2001;4.6% of the total population) living in the La Paz, Intibucá, and Lempira departments;\n* the Miskito (51,607 in 2001; 0.8%) living on the northeast coast along the border with Nicaragua.\n* the Ch'orti' (34,453 in 2001;0.6% of the total population), a Mayan group living in the northwest on the border with Guatemala;\n* the Tolupan (also called Jicaque, \"Xicaque\", or Tol; 9,617 in 2001; 0.2% of the total population), living in the reserve of the Montaña de la Flor and parts of the department of Yoro;\n* the Pech or Paya Indians (3,848 in 2001; 0.1% of the total population) living in a small area in the Olancho department;\n* the Mayangna or Tawahka (2,463 in 2001; <0.1%)\n\n\nExamples of Honduran natives are the many Mayan rules of Copan and other Mayan cities, native leaders as Lempira and Cicumba, and environmental and feminist activist Berta Cáceres.\n\n\n\n#### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Copan founder, king Knich Yax Kuk Moo](image)\n\nCopan founder, king Knich Yax Kuk Moo\n* ![Mayan ruler, Kʼakʼ Yipyaj Chan Kʼawiil](image)\n\nMayan ruler, Kʼakʼ Yipyaj Chan Kʼawiil\n* ![Lencan ruler, Lempira](image)\n\nLencan ruler, Lempira\n* ![Lencan environmental activist, Berta Cáceres](image)\n\nLencan environmental activist, Berta Cáceres\n\n\n### African[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Afro-Honduran\n\nThe Afro-Honduran population consist of people of African descent, Garifuna and Creoles. Most of them are descendants of African people brought by the Spanish and other European colonizers between the 16th and 18th centuries. Many of them came from the west African coast, from places like Angola or Senegambia, where European bought slaves for their colonies, while others came from the other colonies in the Caribbean. \n\n\n\n* The Garifuna are descendants of Carib, Arawak, and West African people. This ethnic group has its origins in a group from St. Vincent islands in the Caribbean, who came in 1797. At the 2001 census 46,448 people were registered as Garifuna, 0.8% of the total population of Honduras.[16] The Garifuna speak an Arawakan language. They live along the entire Caribbean coastline of Honduras, and in the Bay Islands.\n* The number of Creoles was 12,370 (0.2%) in 2001.\n\n\nExamples of well-known Afro-Hondurans are footballers David Suazo, Victor \"Muma\" Bernardez, Dr. Emet Cherefant, and Wilson Palacios.\n\n\n\n#### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Footballer, David Suazo](image)\n\nFootballer, David Suazo\n* ![Footballer, Wilson Palacios](image)\n\nFootballer, Wilson Palacios\n\n\n### European[edit]\n\n\nHonduras of European descent or White Hondurans, along with Afro-descendants and Amerindians belong to the minorities of Honduras. Most of the white population are descendants of the Spanish colonists, who mainly came from southern Spain,[*citation needed*] and inhabit most of the western part of the country. Other populations include descendants of European immigrants who arrived at the beginning of the 20th century. In 2014, there were about 14,000 Hondurans of Italian descent, while there were around 400 Italian citizens.[17] Percentages of whites varied between 4% and 9%,[*citation needed*] due to the fact that the majority of Hondurans identify themselves as mestizos, regardless of their ethnic and racial category. Which makes it more difficult to study the number of people who fit into the white category in Honduras. In a census a total of 450,000 of people from Honduras have appeared who identify themselves as whites, therefore it gives the percentage is 4%.\n\n\nHowever, other studies report that the percentage could rise much more, reaching close to a half a million white people in Honduras, which according to official national sources would make a percentage of between 5% and 6.9% of whites in Hondurans.[*citation needed*] This is because the majority of whites in Honduras do not identify themselves as Euro-descendants as such, adopting and feeling more identified with the mestizo identity.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nExamples of white Hondurans are ex president Simon Azcona del Hoyo, pharmacologist Salvador Moncada, film director Juan Carlos Fanconi, politician Roberto Micheletti, General Florencio Xatruch and former president of the Central American federation Don Francisco Morazán Quezada.\n\n\n\n#### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Central American president, General Francisco Morazán](image)\n\nCentral American president, General Francisco Morazán\n* ![General, Florencio Xatruch](image)\n\nGeneral, Florencio Xatruch\n* ![Ex-President, Francisco Bertrand](image)\n\nEx-President, Francisco Bertrand\n* ![Sir.

A lawyer of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH) stated that the Chinese community in Honduras is rather small. Many of the Chinese are immigrants who arrived from China after the revolution and their descendants.[18]\n\n\n\n* ![Hajime Waki, Honduran-japanese singer.](image)\n\nHajime Waki, Honduran-japanese singer.\n\n\n#### Arabs[edit]\n\n\nHonduras hosts a significant Palestinian community (the vast majority of whom are Christian Arabs).[19] These Arab-Hondurans are sometimes called \"Turcos\", because they arrived in Honduras using Turkish travel documents, as their homeland was then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. The Palestinians arrived in the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, establishing themselves especially in the city of San Pedro Sula.[20] As mentioned earlier, they are also considered whites in the country's censuses, in total the Arab-Hondurans make up 3% of the Honduran population.\n\n\n\n#### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Businessman Miguel Facusse, son of immigrants from the Ottoman empire](image)\n\nBusinessman Miguel Facusse, son of immigrants from the Ottoman empire\n* ![TV host Salvador Nasralla, son of Palestinian immigrants](image)\n\nTV host Salvador Nasralla, son of Palestinian immigrants\n* ![Dr Kerim Gattas Asfura, of Arab descent](image)\n\nDr Kerim Gattas Asfura, of Arab descent\n\n\n## Other sources of demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nDemographic statistics below are based on the 2022 World Population Review.[21]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 3 minutes\n* One death every 12 minutes\n* One net migrant every 96 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 3 minutes\n\n\nDemographic statistics below are based on the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[22]\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n9,459,440 (2022 est.)\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMestizo (mixed Amerindian and European) 90%, Amerindian 7%, African descent 2%, White 1%\n\n\n\n### Age structure[edit]\n\n\n*0-14 years:* 30.2% (male 1,411,537/female 1,377,319)\n*15-24 years:* 21.03% (male 969,302/female 972,843)\n*25-54 years:* 37.79% (male 1,657,260/female 1,832,780)\n*55-64 years:* 5.58% (male 233,735/female 281,525)\n*65 years and over:* 5.4% (male 221,779/female 277,260) (2020 est.)\n### Birth rate[edit]\n\n\n17.92 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)

According to the Ethiopian national census of 2007, the Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, at 34.4% of the nation's population. The Amhara represent 27.0% of the country's inhabitants, while Somalis and Tigrayans represent 6.2% and 6.1% of the population respectively. Other prominent ethnic groups are as follows: Sidama 4.0%, Gurage 2.5%, Welayta 2.3%, Afar 1.7%, Hadiya 1.7%, Gamo 1.5% and Others 12.6%. [3]\n\n\nAfroasiatic-speaking communities make up the majority of the population. Among these, Semitic speakers often collectively refer to themselves as the Habesha people. The Arabic form of this term (*al-Ḥabasha*) is the etymological basis of \"Abyssinia\", the former name of Ethiopia in English and other European languages.[4] Additionally, Nilo-Saharan-speaking ethnic minorities inhabit the southern regions of the country, particularly in areas of the Gambela Region which borders South Sudan. The largest ethnic groups among these include the Nuer and Anuak.[*citation needed*]The Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, being an amalgam of the main homelands of numerous ethnicities, contains over 56 indigenous ethnic groups.[5]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Ethiopia\nAccording to the bibliographic database Glottolog, there are 109 languages spoken in Ethiopia; meanwhile, *Ethnologue* lists 90 individual languages spoken in the country.[6][7] Most people in the country speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches, including the Oromo language, Somali, Amharic, and Tigrinya. Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afroasiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Sidamo, Afar, Hadiyya and Agaw languages, as well as the Semitic Gurage languages, Harari, Silt'e, and Argobba languages. Arabic, which also belongs to the Afroasiatic family, is likewise spoken in some areas.[8]\n\n\nThe principal Semitic language of the north-west and centre of the country is Amharic, which is the language of the Amhara Region. Moreover, Amharic is also one of the official working languages of Ethiopia.[9][10][11]\n\n\nOromo serves as one of the official working languages of Ethiopia[9][10][11] and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system including Oromia,[12] Harar and Dire Dawa regional states and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region.\n\n\n\n## Modern contraception utilization[edit]\n\n\nOnly 28.1% within the ages of 15–49 years used modern contraceptives, according to the data from 2019 Ethiopian Mini Demographic and Health Survey.[13]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Ethiopia\n| Religion in Ethiopia in 2015 by ARDA[14] |\n| --- |\n| Ethiopian Orthodox |  | 42.1% |\n| Islam |  | 34.6% |\n| Protestant |  | 20.8% |\n| Traditional faiths |  | 1.4% |\n| Roman Catholic |  | 0.6% |\n| Other and No religion |  | 0.1% |\n|  |  |  |\nVarious religions are adhered to in Ethiopia. Most Christians live in the highlands, whereas Muslims mainly inhabit the lowlands. Adherents of traditional faiths are primarily concentrated in the southern regions.\n\n\nAccording to the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (2007 census), the national religious composition is Ethiopian Orthodox 43.5%, Protestantism 18.6%, Roman Catholicism 0.7%, Islam 33.9%, traditional 2.6%, and others 0.6%.[15]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 1,000,000 | —     |\n| 1500  | 6,000,000 | +0.12% |\n| 1900  | 10,742,000 | +0.15% |\n| 2000  | 63,000,000 | +1.78% |\n| 2011  | 85,555,555 | +2.82% |\n| 2012  | 84,320,987 | −1.44% |\n| 2013  | 86,613,986 | +2.72% |\n\n\nSource: Central Statistical Agency (CSA)[16]\n\n\nEthiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world.[17] Its total population has grown from 38.1 million in 1983 to 109.5 million in 2018.[18] The population was only about nine million in the 19th century.[19] The 2007 Population and Housing Census results show that the population of Ethiopia grew at an average annual rate of 2.6% between 1994 and 2007, down from 2.8% during the period 1983–1994. As of 2015, the population growth rate is among the top ten countries in the world.[20] According to UN estimations, life expectancy in Ethiopia had improved over time, with male life expectancy reported to be 56 years and for women 60 years.[21]\n\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population, fertility rate and net reproduction rate, United Nations estimates\nAccording to the 2022 revision of the World Population Prospects[1][2], the total population was 120,283,026 in 2021, compared to 18,434,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.5%, 55.8% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.3% was 65 years or older.

According to the Ethiopian national census of 2007, the Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, at 34.4% of the nation's population. The Amhara represent 27.0% of the country's inhabitants, while Somalis and Tigrayans represent 6.2% and 6.1% of the population respectively. Other prominent ethnic groups are as follows: Sidama 4.0%, Gurage 2.5%, Welayta 2.3%, Afar 1.7%, Hadiya 1.7%, Gamo 1.5% and Others 12.6%. [3]\n\n\nAfroasiatic-speaking communities make up the majority of the population. Among these, Semitic speakers often collectively refer to themselves as the Habesha people. The Arabic form of this term (*al-Ḥabasha*) is the etymological basis of \"Abyssinia\", the former name of Ethiopia in English and other European languages.[4] Additionally, Nilo-Saharan-speaking ethnic minorities inhabit the southern regions of the country, particularly in areas of the Gambela Region which borders South Sudan. The largest ethnic groups among these include the Nuer and Anuak.[*citation needed*]The Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, being an amalgam of the main homelands of numerous ethnicities, contains over 56 indigenous ethnic groups.[5]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Ethiopia\nAccording to the bibliographic database Glottolog, there are 109 languages spoken in Ethiopia; meanwhile, *Ethnologue* lists 90 individual languages spoken in the country.[6][7] Most people in the country speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches, including the Oromo language, Somali, Amharic, and Tigrinya. Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afroasiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Sidamo, Afar, Hadiyya and Agaw languages, as well as the Semitic Gurage languages, Harari, Silt'e, and Argobba languages. Arabic, which also belongs to the Afroasiatic family, is likewise spoken in some areas.[8]\n\n\nThe principal Semitic language of the north-west and centre of the country is Amharic, which is the language of the Amhara Region. Moreover, Amharic is also one of the official working languages of Ethiopia.[9][10][11]\n\n\nOromo serves as one of the official working languages of Ethiopia[9][10][11] and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system including Oromia,[12] Harar and Dire Dawa regional states and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region.\n\n\n\n## Modern contraception utilization[edit]\n\n\nOnly 28.1% within the ages of 15–49 years used modern contraceptives, according to the data from 2019 Ethiopian Mini Demographic and Health Survey.[13]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Ethiopia\n| Religion in Ethiopia in 2015 by ARDA[14] |\n| --- |\n| Ethiopian Orthodox |  | 42.1% |\n| Islam |  | 34.6% |\n| Protestant |  | 20.8% |\n| Traditional faiths |  | 1.4% |\n| Roman Catholic |  | 0.6% |\n| Other and No religion |  | 0.1% |\n|  |  |  |\nVarious religions are adhered to in Ethiopia. Most Christians live in the highlands, whereas Muslims mainly inhabit the lowlands. Adherents of traditional faiths are primarily concentrated in the southern regions.\n\n\nAccording to the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (2007 census), the national religious composition is Ethiopian Orthodox 43.5%, Protestantism 18.6%, Roman Catholicism 0.7%, Islam 33.9%, traditional 2.6%, and others 0.6%.[15]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 1,000,000 | —     |\n| 1500  | 6,000,000 | +0.12% |\n| 1900  | 10,742,000 | +0.15% |\n| 2000  | 63,000,000 | +1.78% |\n| 2011  | 85,555,555 | +2.82% |\n| 2012  | 84,320,987 | −1.44% |\n| 2013  | 86,613,986 | +2.72% |\n\n\nSource: Central Statistical Agency (CSA)[16]\n\n\nEthiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world.[17] Its total population has grown from 38.1 million in 1983 to 109.5 million in 2018.[18] The population was only about nine million in the 19th century.[19] The 2007 Population and Housing Census results show that the population of Ethiopia grew at an average annual rate of 2.6% between 1994 and 2007, down from 2.8% during the period 1983–1994. As of 2015, the population growth rate is among the top ten countries in the world.[20] According to UN estimations, life expectancy in Ethiopia had improved over time, with male life expectancy reported to be 56 years and for women 60 years.[21]\n\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population, fertility rate and net reproduction rate, United Nations estimates\nAccording to the 2022 revision of the World Population Prospects[1][2], the total population was 120,283,026 in 2021, compared to 18,434,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.5%, 55.8% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.3% was 65 years or older.

India overtook China to become the most populous country at the end of April 2023.[7] As of the UN data released in April 2023,[8] India has surpassed China to become the world's most populous nation. According to the UN's World Population dashboard, India's population now stands at slightly over 1.428 billion, edging past China's population of 1.425 billion people, as reported by the news agency Bloomberg.[9] its population is set to reach 1.7 billion by 2050.[10][11] In 2017 its population growth rate was 0.98%, ranking 112th in the world; in contrast, from 1972 to 1983, India's population grew by an annual rate of 2.3%.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, the median age of an Indian was 28.7 years,[13] compared to 38.4 for China and 48.6 for Japan; and, by 2030; India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4.[14] However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[15]\n\n\nIndia has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[16] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates: the Nihali language,[17] spoken in parts of Maharashtra, and the Burushaski language, spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. 1,000,000 people in India are Anglo-Indians and 700,000 United States citizens are living in India.[18] They represent over 0.1% of the total population of India. Overall, only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.[19]\n\n\nThe sex ratio was 944 females for 1000 males in 2016, and 940 per 1000 in 2011.[20] This ratio has been showing an upwards trend for the last two decades after a continuous decline in the 20th century.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economic history of India\n\n![](image)Historical population of India and China since 1100 with projection to 2100\n### Prehistory to early 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Estimates of historical world population\n\nThe following table lists estimates for the population of India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) from prehistory up until 1820.

population grew from the South Asian Stone Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate,[32] before population growth slowed down in the classical era up to 500 AD, and then became largely stagnant during the early medieval era era up to 1000 AD.[24][26] The population growth rate then increased in the late medieval era (during the Delhi Sultanate) from 1000 to 1500.[24][26]\n\n\nUnder the Mughal Empire, India experienced a high economic and demographic upsurge,[32] due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production.[33] 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India[34] and contemporary Europe[34] up until the 19th century.[35] These estimates by Abraham Eraly[34] and Paolo Malanima[35] have been criticised by Tim Dyson, who considers them exaggerations and estimates urbanisation of the Mughal Empire to be less than 9% of the population.[36]\n\n\nUnder the reign of Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe.[37] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[38] Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551–1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.[34] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[34] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people[39] and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people.[40] Mughal India also had a large number of villages, with 455,698 villages by the time of Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707).[37]\n\n\n\n### Late 19th century to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman.

Suggestions that it was the benefits of colonialism are refuted by academic thinking: \"There can be no serious, informed belief… that… late colonial era mortality diminished and population grew rapidly because of improvements in income, living standards, nutrition, environmental standards, sanitation or health policies, nor was there a cultural transformation…\".[47]\n\n\n\n## Salient features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crude birth rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 people, national average)[48][49][50]\n![](image)Infant mortality rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 births, under age 1, national average)\nIndia occupies 2.41% of the world's land area but supports over 18% of the world's population. At the 2001 census 72.2% of the population[51] lived in about 638,000 villages[52] and the remaining 27.8%[51] lived in more than 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations.[53]\n\n\nIndia's population exceeded that of the entire continent of Africa by 200 million people in 2010.[54] However, because Africa's population growth is nearly double that of India, it is expected to surpass both China and India by 2025.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Comparative demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nComparative demographics\n| Category\n | Global ranking\n | References\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Area\n

Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that a birth sex ratio between 1.08 and 1.12 can be due to natural factors, such as the age of mother at the baby's birth, the age of father at conception, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, and others.[79] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to birth sex ratios (870–930 girls to 1000 boys) observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 and 2005. They are also similar to birth sex ratios (below 900 girls to 1000 boys) observed in mothers of different age groups and gestation periods in the United States.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Population within

ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[122][123] 700,000 people from the United States of any race live in India.[18] Between 300,000 and 1 million Anglo-Indians live in India.[124]\n\n\nFor a list of ethnic groups in the Republic of India (as well as neighbouring countries) see South Asian ethnic groups.\n\n\n\nLinguistic groups in India chart[125][126]\n\n\n\nIndo-Aryan (75%)\nDravidian (20%)\nKolarian, Tibeto-Burman, Khasi, Tai and others (5%)\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia\n\n### Y-chromosome DNA[edit]\n\n\n[127]\n\n\nY-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, The Indian Y-chromosome pool may be summarised as follows where haplogroups R-M420, H, R2, L and NOP comprise generally more than 80% of the total chromosomes.[128]\n\n\n\n* H ~ 30%\n* R1a ~ 34%\n* R2 ~ 15%\n* L ~ 10%\n* NOP ~ 10% (Excluding R)\n* Other Haplogroups 15%\n\n\n### Mitochondrial DNA[edit]\n\n\n[129]\n\n\nMitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage. The Indian mitochondrial DNA is primarily made up of Haplogroup M[130]\n\n\n\n* Haplogroup M ~ 60%\n* Haplogroup UK ~ 15%\n* Haplogroup N ~ 25% (Excluding UK)\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tripuri children preparing for a dance performance. The Tripuris are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.\nNumerous genomic studies have been conducted in the last 15 years to seek insights into India's demographic and cultural diversity. These studies paint a complex and conflicting picture.\n\n\n\n* In a 2003 study, Basu, Majumder *et al*. have concluded on the basis of results obtained from mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal markers that \"(1) there is an underlying unity of female lineages in India, indicating that the initial number of female settlers may have been small; (2) the tribal and the caste populations are highly differentiated; (3) the Austroasiatic tribals are the earliest settlers in India, providing support to one anthropological hypothesis while refuting some others; (4) a major wave of humans entered India through the northeast; (5) the Tibeto-Burman tribals share considerable genetic commonalities with the Austroasiatic tribals, supporting the hypothesis that they may have shared a common habitat in southern China, but the two groups of tribals can be differentiated on the basis of Y-chromosomal haplotypes; (6) the Dravidian speaking populations were possibly widespread throughout India but are regulated to South India now; (7) formation of populations by fission that resulted in founder and drift effects have left their imprints on the genetic structures of contemporary populations; (8) the upper castes show closer genetic affinities with Central Asian populations, although those of southern India are more distant than those of northern India; (9) historical gene flow into India has contributed to a considerable obliteration of genetic histories of contemporary populations so that there is at present no clear congruence of genetic and geographical or sociocultural affinities.\"[131]\n* In a later 2010 review article, Majumder affirms some of these conclusions, introduces and revises some other. The ongoing studies, concludes Majumder, suggest India has served as the major early corridor for geographical dispersal of modern humans from out-of-Africa. The archaeological and genetic traces of the earliest settlers in India has not provided any conclusive evidence. The tribal populations of India are older than the non-tribal populations. The autosomal differentiation and genetic diversity within India's caste populations at 0.04 is significantly lower than 0.14 for continental populations and 0.09 for 31 world population sets studied by Watkins *et al*., suggesting that while tribal populations were differentiated, the differentiation effects within India's caste population was less than previously thought. Majumder also concludes that recent studies suggest India has been a major contributor to the gene pool of southeast Asia.[132][133]\n* Another study covering a large sample of Indian populations allowed Watkins *et al*. to examine eight Indian caste groups and four endogamous south Indian tribal populations. The Indian castes data show low between-group differences, while the tribal Indian groups show relatively high between-group differentiation. This suggests that people between Indian castes were not reproductively isolated, while Indian tribal populations experienced reproductive isolation and drift. Furthermore, the genetic fixation index data show historical genetic differentiation and segregation between Indian castes population is much smaller than those found in east Asia, Africa and other continental populations; while being similar to the genetic differentiation and segregation observed in European populations.[133]\n* In 2006, Sahoo *et al*. reported their analysis of genomic data on 936 Y-chromosomes representing 32 tribal and 45 caste groups from different regions of India. These scientists find that the haplogroup frequency distribution across the country, between different caste groups, was found to be predominantly driven by geographical, rather than cultural determinants. They conclude there is clear evidence for both large-scale immigration into ancient India of Sino-Tibetan speakers and language change of former Austroasiatic speakers, in the northeast Indian region.[134][135]\n* The genome studies conducted up until 2010 have been on relatively small population sets. Many are from just one southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana, which was part of the state until June 2014). Thus, any conclusions on demographic history of India must be interpreted with caution. A larger national genome study with demographic growth and sex ratio balances may offer further insights on the extent of genetic differentiation and segregation in India over the millenniums.[132]\n\n\n## Charts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

According to the UN's World Population dashboard, India's population now stands at slightly over 1.428 billion, edging past China's population of 1.425 billion people, as reported by the news agency Bloomberg.[9] its population is set to reach 1.7 billion by 2050.[10][11] In 2017 its population growth rate was 0.98%, ranking 112th in the world; in contrast, from 1972 to 1983, India's population grew by an annual rate of 2.3%.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, the median age of an Indian was 28.7 years,[13] compared to 38.4 for China and 48.6 for Japan; and, by 2030; India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4.[14] However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[15]\n\n\nIndia has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[16] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates: the Nihali language,[17] spoken in parts of Maharashtra, and the Burushaski language, spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. 1,000,000 people in India are Anglo-Indians and 700,000 United States citizens are living in India.[18] They represent over 0.1% of the total population of India. Overall, only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.[19]\n\n\nThe sex ratio was 944 females for 1000 males in 2016, and 940 per 1000 in 2011.[20] This ratio has been showing an upwards trend for the last two decades after a continuous decline in the 20th century.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economic history of India\n\n![](image)Historical population of India and China since 1100 with projection to 2100\n### Prehistory to early 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Estimates of historical world population\n\nThe following table lists estimates for the population of India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) from prehistory up until 1820.

population grew from the South Asian Stone Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate,[32] before population growth slowed down in the classical era up to 500 AD, and then became largely stagnant during the early medieval era era up to 1000 AD.[24][26] The population growth rate then increased in the late medieval era (during the Delhi Sultanate) from 1000 to 1500.[24][26]\n\n\nUnder the Mughal Empire, India experienced a high economic and demographic upsurge,[32] due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production.[33] 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India[34] and contemporary Europe[34] up until the 19th century.[35] These estimates by Abraham Eraly[34] and Paolo Malanima[35] have been criticised by Tim Dyson, who considers them exaggerations and estimates urbanisation of the Mughal Empire to be less than 9% of the population.[36]\n\n\nUnder the reign of Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe.[37] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[38] Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551–1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.[34] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[34] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people[39] and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people.[40] Mughal India also had a large number of villages, with 455,698 villages by the time of Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707).[37]\n\n\n\n### Late 19th century to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman.

Suggestions that it was the benefits of colonialism are refuted by academic thinking: \"There can be no serious, informed belief… that… late colonial era mortality diminished and population grew rapidly because of improvements in income, living standards, nutrition, environmental standards, sanitation or health policies, nor was there a cultural transformation…\".[47]\n\n\n\n## Salient features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crude birth rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 people, national average)[48][49][50]\n![](image)Infant mortality rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 births, under age 1, national average)\nIndia occupies 2.41% of the world's land area but supports over 18% of the world's population.

population exceeded that of the entire continent of Africa by 200 million people in 2010.[54] However, because Africa's population growth is nearly double that of India, it is expected to surpass both

Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that a birth sex ratio between 1.08 and 1.12 can be due to natural factors, such as the age of mother at the baby's birth, the age of father at conception, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, and others.[79] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to birth sex ratios (870–930 girls to 1000 boys) observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 and 2005. They are also similar to birth sex ratios (below 900 girls to 1000 boys) observed in mothers of different age groups and gestation periods in the United States.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Population within

ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[122][123] 700,000 people from the United States of any race live in India.[18] Between 300,000 and 1 million Anglo-Indians live in India.[124]\n\n\nFor a list of ethnic groups in the Republic of India (as well as neighbouring countries) see South Asian ethnic groups.\n\n\n\nLinguistic groups in India chart[125][126]\n\n\n\nIndo-Aryan (75%)\nDravidian (20%)\nKolarian, Tibeto-Burman, Khasi, Tai and others (5%)\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia\n\n### Y-chromosome DNA[edit]\n\n\n[127]\n\n\nY-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, The Indian Y-chromosome pool may be summarised as follows where haplogroups R-M420, H, R2, L and NOP comprise generally more than 80% of the total chromosomes.[128]\n\n\n\n* H ~ 30%\n* R1a ~ 34%\n* R2 ~ 15%\n* L ~ 10%\n* NOP ~ 10% (Excluding R)\n* Other Haplogroups 15%\n\n\n### Mitochondrial DNA[edit]\n\n\n[129]\n\n\nMitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage. The Indian mitochondrial DNA is primarily made up of Haplogroup M[130]\n\n\n\n* Haplogroup M ~ 60%\n* Haplogroup UK ~ 15%\n* Haplogroup N ~ 25% (Excluding UK)\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tripuri children preparing for a dance performance. The Tripuris are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.\nNumerous genomic studies have been conducted in the last 15 years to seek insights into India's demographic and cultural diversity. These studies paint a complex and conflicting picture.\n\n\n\n* In a 2003 study, Basu, Majumder *et al*. have concluded on the basis of results obtained from mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal markers that \"(1) there is an underlying unity of female lineages in India, indicating that the initial number of female settlers may have been small; (2) the tribal and the caste populations are highly differentiated; (3) the Austroasiatic tribals are the earliest settlers in India, providing support to one anthropological hypothesis while refuting some others; (4) a major wave of humans entered India through the northeast; (5) the Tibeto-Burman tribals share considerable genetic commonalities with the Austroasiatic tribals, supporting the hypothesis that they may have shared a common habitat in southern China, but the two groups of tribals can be differentiated on the basis of Y-chromosomal haplotypes; (6) the Dravidian speaking populations were possibly widespread throughout India but are regulated to South India now; (7) formation of populations by fission that resulted in founder and drift effects have left their imprints on the genetic structures of contemporary populations; (8) the upper castes show closer genetic affinities with Central Asian populations, although those of southern India are more distant than those of northern India; (9) historical gene flow into India has contributed to a considerable obliteration of genetic histories of contemporary populations so that there is at present no clear congruence of genetic and geographical or sociocultural affinities.\"[131]\n* In a later 2010 review article, Majumder affirms some of these conclusions, introduces and revises some other. The ongoing studies, concludes Majumder, suggest India has served as the major early corridor for geographical dispersal of modern humans from out-of-Africa. The archaeological and genetic traces of the earliest settlers in India has not provided any conclusive evidence. The tribal populations of India are older than the non-tribal populations. The autosomal differentiation and genetic diversity within India's caste populations at 0.04 is significantly lower than 0.14 for continental populations and 0.09 for 31 world population sets studied by Watkins *et al*., suggesting that while tribal populations were differentiated, the differentiation effects within India's caste population was less than previously thought. Majumder also concludes that recent studies suggest India has been a major contributor to the gene pool of southeast Asia.[132][133]\n* Another study covering a large sample of Indian populations allowed Watkins *et al*. to examine eight Indian caste groups and four endogamous south Indian tribal populations. The Indian castes data show low between-group differences, while the tribal Indian groups show relatively high between-group differentiation. This suggests that people between Indian castes were not reproductively isolated, while Indian tribal populations experienced reproductive isolation and drift. Furthermore, the genetic fixation index data show historical genetic differentiation and segregation between Indian castes population is much smaller than those found in east Asia, Africa and other continental populations; while being similar to the genetic differentiation and segregation observed in European populations.[133]\n* In 2006, Sahoo *et al*. reported their analysis of genomic data on 936 Y-chromosomes representing 32 tribal and 45 caste groups from different regions of India. These scientists find that the haplogroup frequency distribution across the country, between different caste groups, was found to be predominantly driven by geographical, rather than cultural determinants. They conclude there is clear evidence for both large-scale immigration into ancient India of Sino-Tibetan speakers and language change of former Austroasiatic speakers, in the northeast Indian region.[134][135]\n* The genome studies conducted up until 2010 have been on relatively small population sets. Many are from just one southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana, which was part of the state until June 2014). Thus, any conclusions on demographic history of India must be interpreted with caution. A larger national genome study with demographic growth and sex ratio balances may offer further insights on the extent of genetic differentiation and segregation in India over the millenniums.[132]\n\n\n## Charts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Following independence they constituted the largest non-indigenous ethnic group in Uganda, at around 80,000 people, and they dominated trade, industry, and the professions. This caused resentment among the native African majority, which was exploited by post-Independence leaders.\n\n\nAfter Idi Amin came to power in 1971, he declared \"economic war\" on the Indians, culminating in the Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972. Since Amin's overthrow in 1979 some Asians have returned. There are between 15,000 and 25,000 in Uganda today, nearly all in the capital Kampala.\n\n\nThere are also about 10,000 Europeans, mostly of native English origin, and 3,000 Arabs of various national origins in Uganda.\n\n\n\n## Other demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nDemographic statistics of Uganda in 2022:\n\n\n\n* One birth every 19 seconds\n* One death every 2 minutes\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 23 seconds\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)The population of Uganda (2005 FAO data; number of inhabitants in millions)\n![](image)Population pyramid in 2020\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n46,205,893 (2022 est.)\n44,279,563 (June 2018 estimate)\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Uganda\n\nProtestant 45.1% (Anglican 32.0%, Pentecostal/Born Again/Evangelical 11.1%, Seventh Day Adventist 1.7%, Baptist .3%), Roman Catholic 39.3%, Muslim 13.7%, other 1.6%, none 0.2% (2014 est.)\n\n\nUganda is a religiously diverse nation with Christianity being the most widely professed religion.

Following independence they constituted the largest non-indigenous ethnic group in Uganda, at around 80,000 people, and they dominated trade, industry, and the professions. This caused resentment among the native African majority, which was exploited by post-Independence leaders.\n\n\nAfter Idi Amin came to power in 1971, he declared \"economic war\" on the Indians, culminating in the Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972. Since Amin's overthrow in 1979 some Asians have returned. There are between 15,000 and 25,000 in Uganda today, nearly all in the capital Kampala.\n\n\nThere are also about 10,000 Europeans, mostly of native English origin, and 3,000 Arabs of various national origins in Uganda.\n\n\n\n## Other demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nDemographic statistics of Uganda in 2022:\n\n\n\n* One birth every 19 seconds\n* One death every 2 minutes\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 23 seconds\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)The population of Uganda (2005 FAO data; number of inhabitants in millions)\n![](image)Population pyramid in 2020\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n46,205,893 (2022 est.)\n44,279,563 (June 2018 estimate)\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Uganda\n\nProtestant 45.1% (Anglican 32.0%, Pentecostal/Born Again/Evangelical 11.1%, Seventh Day Adventist 1.7%, Baptist .3%), Roman Catholic 39.3%, Muslim 13.7%, other 1.6%, none 0.2% (2014 est.)\n\n\nUganda is a religiously diverse nation with Christianity being the most widely professed religion.

It is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world and the third-most populous country in the Americas after the United States and Brazil.[5] Throughout most of the 20th century Mexico's population was characterized by rapid growth. Although this tendency has been reversed and average annual population growth over the last five years was less than 1%, the demographic transition is still in progress; Mexico still has a large youth cohort. The most populous city in the country is the capital, Mexico City, with a population of 8.9 million (2016), and its metropolitan area is also the most populated with 20.1 million (2010). Approximately 50% of the population lives in one of the 55 large metropolitan areas in the country. In total, about 78.84% of the population of the country lives in urban areas, and only about 21.16% in rural ones.\n\n\nDemographic censuses are performed by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informatica. The National Population Council (CONAPO) is an institution under the Ministry of Interior in charge of the analysis and research of population dynamics. The National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (CDI), also undertakes research and analysis of the sociodemographic and linguistic indicators of the indigenous peoples.\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic dynamics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mexicans\n\n![](image)*Mestiza* woman clad in indigenous clothes\n![](image)Historical population of Mexico\n![](image)Population growth\n![](image)Mexican states by population density\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1865  | 8,259,080[6] | —     |\n| 1895  | 12,700,294 | +1.44% |\n| 1900  | 13,607,272 | +1.39% |\n| 1910  | 15,160,369 | +1.09% |\n| 1921  | 14,334,780 | −0.51% |\n| 1930  | 16,552,722 | +1.61% |\n| 1940  | 19,653,552 | +1.73% |\n| 1950  | 25,791,017 | +2.75% |\n| 1960  | 34,923,129 | +3.08% |\n| 1970  | 48,225,238 | +3.28% |\n| 1980  | 66,846,833 | +3.32% |\n| 1990  | 81,249,645 | +1.97% |\n| 2000  | 97,483,412 | +1.84% |\n| 2010  | 112,336,538 | +1.43% |\n| 2020  | 126,014,024 | +1.16% |\n| Source: INEGI |\n\n\nIn 1900, the Mexican population was 13.6 million.[7] During the period of economic prosperity that was dubbed by economists as the \"Mexican Miracle\", the government invested in efficient social programs that reduced the infant mortality rate and increased life expectancy. These measures jointly led to an intense demographic increase between 1930 and 1980. The population's annual growth rate has been reduced from a 3.5% peak in 1965 to 0.99% in 2005. While Mexico is now transitioning to the third phase of demographic transition, close to 50% of the population in 2009 was 25 years old or younger.[8] Fertility rates have also decreased from 5.7 children per woman in 1976 to 2.2 in 2006.[9] After decades of the gap narrowing, in 2020 the fertility rate in Mexico fell below the United States for the first time falling 22% in 2020 and a further 10.5% in the first half of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\nThe average annual population growth rate of Mexico City was 0.2%. The state with the lowest population growth rate over the same period was Michoacán (-0.1%), whereas the states with the highest population growth rates were Quintana Roo (4.7%) and Baja California Sur (3.4%),[11] both of which are two of the least populous states and the last to be admitted to the Union in the 1970s. The average annual net migration rate of Mexico City over the same period was negative and the lowest of all political divisions of Mexico, whereas the states with the highest net migration rate were Quintana Roo (2.7), Baja California (1.8) and Baja California Sur (1.6).[12] While the national annual growth rate was still positive (1.0%) in the early years of the 2000s, the national net migration rate was negative (-4.75/1000 inhabitants), given the former strong flow of immigrants to the United States; an estimated 5.3 million undocumented Mexican immigrants lived in the United States in 2004[13] and 18.2 million American citizens in the 2000 Census declared having Mexican ancestry.[14] However, as of recent years in the 2010s, the net migration rate reached 0, given the strong economy of Mexico, changes in US Immigration Policy & Enforcement, US Legislative and CFR-8 decisions, plus the (then) slowly recovering US economy, causing many of its former residents to return. The Mexican government projects[15] that the Mexican population will grow to about 123 million by 2042 and then start declining slowly. Assumptions underlying this projection include fertility stabilizing at 1.85 children per woman and continued high net emigration (slowly decreasing from 583,000 in 2005 to 393,000 in 2050).\n\n\nThe states and Mexico City that make up the Mexican federation are collectively called \"federal entities\". The five most populous federal entities in 2005 were the State of Mexico (14.4 million), Mexico City (8.7 million), Veracruz (7.1 million), Jalisco (6.7 million) and Puebla (5.4 million), which collectively contain 40.7% of the national population. Mexico City, being coextensive with the Mexico City, is the most populous city in the country, while Greater Mexico City, that includes the adjacent municipalities that comprise a metropolitan area, is estimated to be the second most populous in the world (after Tokyo), according to the UN Urbanization Report.\n\n\nIntense population growth in the northern states, especially along the US-Mexican border, changed the country's demographic profile in the second half of the 20th century, as the 1967 US-Mexico maquiladora agreement through which all products manufactured in the border cities could be imported duty-free to the US. Since the adoption of NAFTA in 1994, however, which allows all products to be imported duty-free regardless of their place of origin within Mexico, the non-border maquiladora share of exports has increased while that of border cities has decreased,.[16] This has led to decentralization and rapid economic growth in Mexican states (and cities), such as Quintana Roo (Cancun), Baja California Sur (La Paz), Nuevo León (Monterrey), Querétaro, and Aguascalientes. The population of each of these five states grew by more than one-third from 2000 to 2015, while the whole of Mexico grew by 22.6% in this period.\n\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexico's population pyramid (2017)\nAccording to the 2012 revision of the World Population Prospects, the total population was 117,886,000 in 2010, compared to only 28,296,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 30%, 64% of the population was between 15 and 65 years of age, and 6% was 65 years or older.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Total population (x 1000)\n | Proportionaged 0–14(%)\n | Proportionaged 15–64(%)\n | Proportionaged 65+(%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950\n | 28 296 | 42.5 | 54.1 | 3.5\n |\n| 1955\n | 33 401 | 44.5 | 52.2 | 3.3\n |\n| 1960\n | 38 677 | 45.9 | 50.8 | 3.4\n |\n| 1965\n | 45 339 | 46.8 | 49.6 | 3.5\n |\n| 1970\n | 52 988 | 46.6 | 49.7 | 3.7\n |\n| 1975\n | 61 708 | 46.2 | 50.1 | 3.7\n |\n| 1980\n | 70 353 | 44.7 | 51.5 | 3.8\n |\n| 1985\n | 77 859 | 42.1 | 53.9 | 3.9\n |\n| 1990\n | 86 077 | 38.5 | 57.2 | 4.3\n |\n| 1995\n | 95 393 | 35.9 | 59.6 | 4.5\n |\n| 2000\n | 103 874 | 34.1 | 61.0 | 4.9\n |\n| 2005\n | 110 732 | 32.3 | 62.4 | 5.3\n |\n| 2010\n | 117 886 | 30.0 | 64.0 | 6.0\n |\n| 2015\n | 127 017 | 27.6 | 65.9 | 6.5\n |\n| 2020\n | 134 837 | 25.6 | 66.9 | 7.6\n |\n\n\n### Structure of the population[edit]\n\n\nPopulation by Sex and Age Group (Census 12.VI.2010) (Including an estimation of 1 334 585 persons corresponding to 448 195 housing units without information of the occupants.):[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age Group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 54 855 231\n | 57 481 307\n | 112 336 538\n | 100\n |\n| 0–4\n | 5 346 943\n | 5 181 379\n | 10 528 322\n | 9.37\n |\n| 5–9\n | 5 604 175\n | 5 443 362\n | 11 047 537\n | 9.83\n |\n| 10–14\n | 5 547 613\n | 5 392 324\n | 10 939 937\n | 9.74\n |\n| 15–19\n | 5 520 121\n | 5 505 991\n | 11 026 112\n | 9.82\n |\n| 20–24\n | 4 813 204\n | 5 079 067\n | 9 892 271\n | 8.81\n |\n| 25–29\n | 4 205 975\n | 4 582 202\n | 8 788 177\n | 7.82\n |\n| 30–34\n | 4 026 031\n | 4 444 767\n | 8 470 798\n | 7.54\n |\n| 35–39\n | 3 964 738\n | 4 328 249\n | 8 292 987\n | 7.38\n |\n| 40–44\n | 3 350 322\n | 3 658 904\n | 7 009 226\n | 6.24\n |\n| 45–49\n | 2 824 364\n | 3 104 366\n | 5 928 730\n | 5.28\n |\n| 50–54\n | 2 402 451\n | 2 661 840\n | 5 064 291\n | 4.51\n |\n| 55–59\n | 1 869 537\n | 2 025 828\n | 3 895 365\n | 3.47\n |\n| 60–64\n | 1 476 667\n | 1 639 799\n | 3 116 466\n | 2.77\n |\n| 65–69\n | 1 095 273\n | 1 221 992\n | 2 317 265\n | 2.06\n |\n| 70–74\n | 873 893\n | 1 000 041\n | 1 873 934\n | 1.67\n |\n| 75–79\n | 579 689\n | 665 794\n | 1 245 483\n | 1.11\n |\n| 80–84\n | 355 277\n | 443 659\n | 798 936\n | 0.71\n |\n| 85–89\n | 197 461\n | 256 703\n | 454 164\n | 0.40\n |\n| 90–94\n | 68 130\n | 96 794\n | 164 924\n | 0.15\n |\n| 95–99\n | 25 920\n | 39 812\n | 65 732\n | 0.06\n |\n| 100+\n | 7 228\n | 11 247\n | 18 475\n | 0.02\n |\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Percent\n |\n| 0–14\n | 16 498 731\n | 16 017 065\n | 32 515 796\n | 28.94\n |\n| 15–64\n | 34 453 410\n | 37 031 013\n | 71 484 423\n | 63.63\n |\n| 65+\n | 3 202 871\n | 3 736 042\n | 6 938 913\n | 6.18\n |\n| unknown\n | 700 219\n | 697 187\n | 1 397 406\n | 1.24\n |\n\n\nPopulation by Sex and Age Group (Census 15.III.2020) (Including an estimation of 6 337 751 persons corresponding to 1 588 422 housing units without information of the occupants.):[19]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 61 473 390\n | 64 540 634\n | 126 014 024\n | 100\n |\n| 0–4\n | 5 077 482\n | 4 969 883\n | 10 047 365\n | 7.97\n |\n| 5–9\n | 5 453 091\n | 5 311 288\n | 10 764 379\n | 8.54\n |\n| 10–14\n | 5 554 260\n | 5 389 280\n | 10 943 540\n | 8.68\n |\n| 15–19\n | 5 462 150\n | 5 344 540\n | 10 806 690\n | 8.57\n |\n| 20–24\n | 5 165 884\n | 5 256 211\n | 10 422 095\n | 8.27\n |\n| 25–29\n | 4 861 404\n | 5 131 597\n | 9 993 001\n | 7.93\n |\n| 30–34\n | 4 527 726\n | 4 893 101\n | 9 420 827\n | 7.47\n |\n| 35–39\n | 4 331 530\n | 4 668 746\n | 9 020 276\n | 7.15\n |\n| 40–44\n | 4 062 304\n | 4 441 282\n | 8 503 586\n | 6.74\n |\n| 45–49\n | 3 812 344\n | 4 130 069\n | 7 942 413\n | 6.30\n |\n| 50–54\n | 3 332 163\n | 3 705 360\n | 7 037 532\n | 5.58\n |\n| 55–59\n | 2 692 976\n | 3 002 982\n | 5 695 958\n | 4.52\n |\n| 60–64\n | 2 257 862\n | 2 563 200\n | 4 821 062\n | 3.82\n |\n| 65–69\n | 1 706 850\n | 1 938 227\n | 3 645 077\n | 2.89\n |\n| 70–74\n | 1 233 492\n | 1 413 848\n | 2 647 340\n | 2.10\n |\n| 75–79\n | 847 898\n | 966 684\n | 1 814 582\n | 1.43\n |\n| 80–84\n | 523 812\n | 651 552\n | 1 175 364\n | 0.93\n |\n| 85+\n | 433 968\n | 605 583\n | 1 039 551\n | 0.82\n |\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Percent\n |\n| 0–14\n | 16 084 833\n | 15 670 451\n | 31 755 284\n | 25.20\n |\n| 15–64\n | 40 506 343\n | 43 157 097\n | 83 663 440\n | 66.39\n |\n| 65+\n | 4 746 020\n | 5 575 894\n | 10 321 914\n | 8.19\n |\n| unknown\n | 136 194\n | 137 192\n | 273 386\n | 0.22\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Non-Spanish immigrant groups included British, Irish, Italian, German, French and Dutch.[30] Large numbers of Middle Eastern immigrants arrived in Mexico during the same period, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.[31] Asian immigrants, mostly Chinese, some via the United States, settled in northern Mexico, whereas Koreans settled in central Mexico.[32]\n\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s Mexico opened its doors to immigrants from Latin America, mainly political refugees from Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Peru, Colombia and Central America. The PRI governments, in power for most of the 20th century, had a policy of granting asylum to fellow Latin Americans fleeing political persecution in their home countries. A second wave of immigrants has come to Mexico as a result of the economic crises experienced by some countries in the region. The Argentine community is quite significant estimated to be somewhere between 11,000 and 30,000.[33][34]\n\n\nDue to the 2008 Financial Crisis and the resulting economic decline and high unemployment in Spain, many Spaniards have been emigrating to Mexico to seek new opportunities.[35] For example, during the last quarter of 2012, a number of 7,630 work permits were granted to Spaniards.[36]\n\n\nMexico is also the country where the largest number of American citizens live abroad, with Mexico City playing host to the largest number of American citizens abroad in the world. The American Citizens Abroad Association estimated in 1999 that a little more than one million Americans live in Mexico (which represent 1% of the population in Mexico and 25% of all American citizens living abroad).[37] This immigration phenomenon could well be explained by the interaction of both countries under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but also by the fact that Mexico has become a popular destination for retirees, especially the small towns: just in the State of Guanajuato, in San Miguel de Allende and its surroundings, 10,000 Americans have their residence.[38]\n\n\nDiscrepancies between the figures of official legal aliens and all foreign-born residents is quite large. The official figure for foreign-born residents in Mexico in 2000 was 493,000,[39] with a majority (86.9%) of these born in the United States (except Chiapas, where the majority of immigrants are from Central America). The six states with the most immigrants are Baja California (12.1% of total immigrants), Mexico City (11.4%), Jalisco (9.9%), Chihuahua (9%) and Tamaulipas (7.3%).[39]\n\n\n\n### Emigration from Mexico[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Trend of Mexican migration to the United States. Here the term immigrant refers to those who were not born in the U.S. but are now currently residing in the U.S. This can include naturalized U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, employees and students on visas, and the undocumented.[40]\nThe national net migration rate of Mexico is negative, estimated at -1.8 migrants per 1,000 population as of 2017[update].[41]\nThe great majority of Mexican emigrants have moved to the United States of America. This migration phenomenon is not new, but it has been a defining feature in the relationship of both countries for most of the 20th century.[42] During World Wars I and II, the United States government approved the recruitment of Mexican workers in their territory, and tolerated unauthorized migration to obtain additional farm- and industrial-workers to fill the necessary spots vacated by the population in war, and to supply the increase in the demand for labor. Nonetheless, the United States unilaterally ended the wartime programs – in part as a result of arguments from labor and from civil-rights groups.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The San Ysidro Port of Entry is the fourth busiest border checkpoint in the world. Most traffic is related to commerce or day workers, rather than immigration.\nIn spite of that, emigration of Mexicans continued throughout the rest of the 20th century at varying rates. It grew significantly during the 1990s and continued to do so in the first years of the 2000s. In fact, it has been estimated that 37% of all Mexican immigrants to the United States in the 20th century arrived during the 1990s.[42] In 2000 approximately 20 million American residents identified themselves as either Mexican, Mexican-Americans or of Mexican origin, making \"Mexican\" the sixth-most cited ancestry of all US residents.[44]\n\n\nIn 2000 the INEGI estimated that about eight million Mexican-born people, which then was equivalent to 8.7% of the population of Mexico itself, lived in the United States of America.[45] In that year, the Mexican states sending the greatest numbers of emigrants to the United States were Jalisco (170,793), Michoacán (165,502), and Guanajuato (163,338); the total number of Mexican emigrants to the United States in 2000, both legal and illegal, was estimated at 1,569,157; the great majority of these were men.[46] Approximately 30% of emigrants come from rural communities.[47] In 2000, 260,650 emigrants returned to Mexico.[48] According to the Pew Hispanic Center in 2006, an estimated ten percent of all Mexican citizens lived in the United States.[49] The population of Mexican immigrants residing illegally in the United States fell from around seven million in 2007 to about 6.1 million in 2011.[50] This trajectory has been linked[*by whom?*] to the economic downturn which started in 2008 and which reduced available jobs, and to the introduction of stricter immigration laws in many States.[51][52][53][54] According to the Pew Hispanic Center the total number of Mexican-born people had stagnated in 2010 and then began to fall.[55]\n\n\nAfter the Mexican-American community, Mexican Canadians are the second-largest group of emigrant Mexicans, with a population of over 50,000.[56] A significant but unknown number of mestizos of Mexican descent migrated to the Philippines during the era of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, when the Philippines was a territory under the rule of Mexico city.[57] Mexicans live throughout Latin America as well as in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Emigration list from Mexico[58]Mexican residents in the world by countries\n |\n| --- |\n| Country\n | Population\n | Position\n | Continent\n |\n| ![](image) United States | 36,300,000[59] | 1 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Canada | 90,585[60] | 2 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 56,757[61] | 3 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Guatemala | 14,481[62] | 4 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Bolivia | 13,377[63] | 5 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 8,848[64] | 6 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 6,750[65] | 7 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 5,125[66] | 8 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Australia | 4,872[67] | 9 | Oceania\n |\n| ![](image) France | 4,601[68] | 10 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Israel | 4,252[69] | 11 | Asia\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 3,758[70] | 12 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 3,485[70] | 13 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Venezuela | 3,075[71] | 14 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 2,794[72] | 15 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Belize | 2,349[73] | 16 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Costa Rica | 2,327[74] | 17 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Panama | 2,299[75] | 18 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Colombia | 2,286[76] | 19 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Chile | 1,874[77] | 20 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Paraguay | 1,778[78] | 21 | South America\n |\n| The list includes also temporary residents (1–3 years' stay) |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMexican diaspora\n |\n| --- |\n| Americas | * Argentina\n* Belize\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n* Chile\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* El Salvador\n* Guatemala\n* Honduras\n* Panama\n* Paraguay\n* United States\n |\n| Asia | * Israel\n* Japan\n* Philippines\n |\n| Europe | * France\n* Germany\n* Italy\n* Netherlands\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* United Kingdom\n |\n| Oceania | * Australia\n* New Zealand\n |\n\n## Cities and metropolitan areas[edit]\n\n\n### Settlements, cities and municipalities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities in Mexico\n\nSee also: Municipalities of Mexico\n\n\n\n| Most populated municipalities\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| *Municipality of Guadalajara* |\n| Municipality\n | Pop.

A city is defined to be a settlement with more than 2,500 inhabitants. In 2005 there were 2,640 cities with a population between 2,500 and 15,000 inhabitants, 427 with a population between 15,000 and 100,000 inhabitants, 112 with a population between 100,000 and one million, and 11 with a population of more than one million.[79] All cities are considered \"urban areas\" and represent 76.5% of total population. Settlements with less than 2,500 inhabitants are considered \"rural communities\" (in fact, more than 80,000 of those settlements have only one or two housing units). Rural population in Mexico is 22.2% of total population.[79]\n\n\nMunicipalities (*municipios* in Spanish) and boroughs (*delegaciones* in Spanish) are incorporated places in Mexico, that is, second or third-level political divisions with internal autonomy, legally prescribed limits, powers and functions. In terms of second-level political divisions there are 2,438 municipalities and Mexico and 16 semi-autonomous boroughs (all within the Federal District). A municipality can be constituted by one or more cities one of which is the *cabecera municipal* (municipal seat). Cities are usually contained within the limits of a single municipality, with a few exceptions in which small areas of one city may extend to other adjacent municipalities *without* incorporating the city which serves as the municipal seat of the adjacent municipality. Some municipalities or cities within municipalities are further divided into *delegaciones* or boroughs. However, unlike the boroughs of the Federal District, these are third-level administrative divisions; they have very limited autonomy and no elective representatives.\n\n\nMunicipalities in central Mexico are usually very small in area and thus coextensive with cities (as is the case of Guadalajara, Puebla and León), whereas municipalities in northern and southeastern Mexico are much larger and usually contain more than one city or town that may not necessarily conform a single urban agglomeration (as is the case of Tijuana).\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan areas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Metropolitan areas of Mexico\n\n![](image)Mexican woman from Ajuchitlán del Progreso, a Nahua area, (2021).\nA metropolitan area in Mexico is defined to be the group of municipalities that heavily interact with each other, usually around a core city.[80] In 2004, a joint effort between CONAPO, INEGI and the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL) agreed to define metropolitan areas as either:[80]\n\n\n\n* the group of two or more municipalities in which a city with a population of at least 50,000 is located whose urban area extends over the limit of the municipality that originally contained the core city incorporating either physically or under its area of direct influence other adjacent predominantly urban municipalities all of which have a high degree of social and economic integration or are relevant for urban politics and administration; or\n* a single municipality in which a city of a population of at least one million is located and fully contained, (that is, it does not transcend the limits of a single municipality); or\n* a city with a population of at least 250,000 which forms a conurbation with other cities in the United States of America.\n\n\nIn 2004 there were 55 metropolitan areas in Mexico, in which close to 53% of the country's population lives. The most populous metropolitan area in Mexico is the *Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico*, or Greater Mexico City, which in 2005 had a population of 19.23 million, or 19% of the nation's population. The next four largest metropolitan areas in Mexico are Greater Guadalajara (4.1 million), Greater Monterrey (3.7 million), Greater Puebla (2.1 million) and Greater Toluca (1.6 million),[81] whose added population, along with Greater Mexico City, is equivalent to 30% of the nation's population. Greater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country since the 1930s until the late 1980s. Since then, the country has slowly become economically and demographically less centralized. From 2000 to 2005 the average annual growth rate of Greater Mexico City was the lowest of the five largest metropolitan areas, whereas the fastest growing metropolitan area was Puebla (2.0%) followed by Monterrey (1.9%), Toluca (1.8%) and Guadalajara (1.8%).[81]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in Mexico2020 National Population Census[82]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Valley of Mexico](image)Valley of Mexico![Monterrey](image)Monterrey | 1 | Valley of Mexico | Mexico City, State of Mexico, Hidalgo | 21,804,515 | 11 | Aguascalientes | Aguascalientes | 1,225,432\n | ![Guadalajara](image)Guadalajara![Puebla–Tlaxcala](image)Puebla–Tlaxcala |\n| 2 | Monterrey | Nuevo León | 5,341,171 | 12 | San Luis Potosí | San Luis Potosí | 1,221,526\n |\n| 3 | Guadalajara | Jalisco | 5,286,642 | 13 | Mérida | Yucatán | 1,201,000\n |\n| 4 | Puebla–Tlaxcala | Puebla, Tlaxcala | 3,199,530 | 14 | Mexicali | Baja California | 1,031,779\n |\n| 5 | Toluca | State of Mexico | 2,353,924 | 15 | Saltillo | Coahuila | 1,031,779\n |\n| 6 | Tijuana | Baja California | 2,157,853 | 16 | Cuernavaca | Morelos | 1,028,589\n |\n| 7 | León | Guanajuato | 1,924,771 | 17 | Culiacán | Sinaloa | 1,003,530\n |\n| 8 | Querétaro | Querétaro | 1,594,212 | 18 | Morelia | Michoacán | 988,704\n |\n| 9 | Juárez | Chihuahua | 1,512,450 | 19 | Chihuahua | Chihuahua | 988,065\n |\n| 10 | La Laguna | Coahuila, Durango | 1,434,283 | 20 | Veracruz | Veracruz | 939,046\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Other demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mexican mestizo population is the most diverse of all the mestizo groups of Latin America, with its mestizos being either largely European or Amerindian rather than having a uniform admixture.[83] Distribution of Admixture Estimates for Individuals from Mexico City and Quetalmahue (indigenous community in Chile).\n![](image)Regional variation of ancestry according to a study made by Ruiz-Linares in 2014, each dot represents a volunteer, with most coming from south Mexico and Mexico City.[84]\n![](image)Trivate for ancestry, from the same study as the image above.[84]\nDemographic statistics according to the 2022 World Population Review.[85]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 15 seconds\n* One death every 39 seconds\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 24 seconds\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[86]\n\n\n\n### Median age[edit]\n\n\ntotal: 29.3 years.

The second article of the Mexican Constitution defines the country to be a pluricultural state originally based on its indigenous peoples.\n\n\nRegardless of ethnicity, the majority of Mexicans are united under the same national identity.[87] This is the product of an ideology strongly promoted by Mexican academics such as Manuel Gamio and José Vasconcelos known as mestizaje, whose goal was that of Mexico becoming a racially and culturally homogeneous country.[88][87][89] The ideology's influence was reflected in Mexico's national censuses of 1921 and 1930: in the former, which was Mexico's first-ever national census (but second-ever if the census made in colonial times is taken into account)[90] that considered race, approximately 60% of Mexico's population identified as Mestizos,[91] and in the latter, Mexico's government declared that all Mexicans were now Mestizos, for which racial classifications would be dropped in favor of language-based ones in future censuses.[92] During most of the 20th century these censuses' results were taken as fact, with extraofficial international publications often using them as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition,[93][94][95] but in recent time historians and academics have claimed that said results are not accurate, as in its efforts to homogenize Mexico, the government inflated the Mestizo label's percentage by classifying a good number of people as such regardless of whether they were of actual mixed ancestry or not,[96][97][98][99] pointing out that an alteration so drastic of population trends compared to earlier censuses such as New Spain's 1793 census (on which Europeans were estimated to be 18% to 22% of the population, Mestizos 21% to 25% and Indigenous peoples 51% to 61%)[90] is not possible and that the frequency of marriages between people of different ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico was low.[100][101] It is also observed that when asked directly about their ethno-racial identification, many Mexicans nowadays do not identify as Mestizos,[102] would not agree to be labeled as such,[103] and that \"static\" ethnoracial labels such as \"White\" “Black” or \"Indian\" are far more prominent in contemporary Mexican society than the \"Mestizo\" one is, whose use is mostly limited to intellectual circles, a result of the label's constantly-changing and subjective definition.[104]\n\n\n\n### Mestizo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mestizos in Mexico\n\n![](image)President Porfirio Diaz was of Mestizo descent\nA large majority of Mexicans have been classified as \"Mestizos\", meaning in modern Mexican usage that they identify fully neither with any indigenous culture nor with a Spanish cultural heritage, but rather identify as having cultural traits incorporating elements from both indigenous and Spanish traditions. By the deliberate efforts of post-revolutionary governments, the \"Mestizo identity\" was constructed as the base of the modern Mexican national identity, through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as *mestizaje* [mestiˈsaxe]. Mexican politicians and reformers such as José Vasconcelos and Manuel Gamio were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity upon this concept.[105][106]\n\n\nSince the Mestizo identity promoted by the government is more of a cultural identity than a biological one it has achieved a strong influence in the country, a good number of phenotypically white people identifying with it, leading to being considered Mestizos in Mexico's demographic investigations and censuses due to the ethnic criteria having its base on cultural traits rather than biological ones.[107] A similar situation occurs regarding the distinctions between Indigenous peoples and Mestizos: while the term *Mestizo* is sometimes used in English with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and European blood, In Mexican society an indigenous person can be considered mestizo.[108] and a person with none or a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage.[109][110][111] In the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo has a different meaning, with it being to refer to the Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the caste war of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as Mestizos.[99] In Chiapas the word \"Ladino\" is used instead of mestizo.[112]\n\n\n\n![](image)Diego Boneta Mexican actor and singer.\nGiven that the word Mestizo has different meanings in Mexico, estimates of the Mexican Mestizo population vary widely. According to the *Encyclopædia Britannica*, which uses a biology-based approach, between one half and two-thirds of the Mexican population is Mestizo[113] whereas a culture-based criteria estimates a percentage as high as 90%.[92] Recent research based on self-identification nonetheless, has observed that many Mexicans do not identify as mestizos[102] and would not agree to be labeled as such,[103] with \"static\" racial labels such as White, Indian, Black etc. being more commonly used.[104]\n\n\n\n![](image)Climate activist Xiye Bastida, daughter of an Otomi father and Celtic mother.\nThe use of variated methods and criteria to quantify the number of Mestizos in Mexico is not new: Since several decades ago, many authors have analyzed colonial censuses data and have made different conjectures respecting the ethnic composition of the population of colonial Mexico/New Spain. There are Historians such as Gonzalo Aguirre-Beltrán who claimed in 1972 that practically the totality of New Spain's population, in reality, were Mestizos, using to back up his claims arguments such as that affairs of Spaniards with non-Europeans due to the alleged absence of female European immigrants were widespread as well as there being a huge desire of Mestizos to \"pass\" as Spaniards, this because Spanishness was seen as a symbol of high status.[114][115] Other historians however, point that Aguirre-Beltran numbers tend to have inconsistencies and take too much liberties (it is pointed out in the book *Ensayos sobre historia de la población. México y el Caribe 2* published in 1998 that on 1646, when according to historic registers the mestizo population was of 1% he estimates it to be 16.6% already, with this being attributed to him interpreting the data in a way convenient for a historic narrative),[116][97] often omitting data of New Spain's northern and western provinces.[117] His self-made classifications thus, although could be plausible, are not useful for precise statistical analysis.[118] According 21st-century historians, Aguirre Beltran also disregards facts such as the population dynamics of New Spain being different depending on the region at hand (i.e. miscegenation couldn't happen in a significant amount in regions on which the native population was openly hostile until early 20th century, such as most of New Spain's internal provinces, which nowadays are the northern and western regions of Mexico),[97] or that historic accounts made by investigators at the time consistently observed that New Spain's European population was notoriously concerned with preserving their European heritage, with practices such as inviting relatives and friends directly from Spain or favoring Europeans for marriage even if they were from a lower socioeconomic level than them being common.[119][116][97] Newer publications that do cite Aguirre-Beltran's work take those factors into consideration, stating that the Spaniard/Euromestizo/Criollo ethnic label was composed on its majority by descendants of Europeans albeit the category may have included people with some non-European ancestry.[120]\n\n\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples of Mexico\n\n![](image)President Benito Juarez was of Zapotec ancestry. He became the first Amerindian president in the Americas.\nPrior to contact with Europeans the indigenous people of Mexico had not had any kind of shared identity.[121] Indigenous identity was constructed by the dominant Euro-Mestizo majority and imposed upon the indigenous people as a negatively defined identity, characterized by the lack of assimilation into modern Mexico. Indigenous identity therefore became socially stigmatizing.[122] Cultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to help indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the rest of society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to Mestizo Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the \"Indian problem\" by transforming indigenous communities into mestizo communities.[123]\n\n\n\n![](image)Actress Yalitza Aparicio, daughter of a Mixtec father and Triqui mother.\nThe category of \"indígena\" (indigenous) in Mexico has been defined based on different criteria throughout history. This means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as \"indigenous\" varies according to the definition applied. It can be defined narrowly according to a linguistic criterion, including only persons that speak an Indigenous language. Based on this criterion, approximately 6.1% of the population is Indigenous.[124][125] Nonetheless, activists for the rights of indigenous peoples have referred to the usage of this criterion for census purposes as \"statistical genocide.\"[126][127]  \n Other surveys made by the Mexican government do count as Indigenous all persons who speak an indigenous language and people who do not speak indigenous languages nor live in indigenous communities but self-identify as Indigenous.\n\n\nAccording to these criteria, the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography), state that there are 15.7 million indigenous people in Mexico of many different ethnic groups,[128] which constitute 14.9% of the population in the country.[129]  \n Finally, according to the latest intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government in 2015, Indigenous people make up 21.5% of Mexico's population. In this occasion, people who self-identified as \"Indigenous\" and people who self-identified as \"partially Indigenous\" were classified in the \"Indigenous\" category altogether.[130]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Largest indigenous peoples\n |\n| --- |\n| *Mayas in Chiapas* |\n| Group\n | Number\n |\n| Nahua peoples (Nawatlaka)\n | 2,445,969\n |\n| Maya (Maaya)\n | 1,475,575\n |\n| Zapotec (Binizaa)\n | 777,253\n |\n| Mixtec (Ñuu sávi)\n | 726,601\n |\n| Otomí (Hñähñü)\n | 646,875\n |\n| Totonac (Tachihuiin)\n | 411,266\n |\n| Source: CDI (2000) [4] Archived September 15, 2019, at the Wayback Machine |\n\n\nThe Mexican constitution not only recognizes the 62 indigenous peoples living in Mexican territory but also grants them autonomy and protects their culture and languages. This protection and autonomy is extended to those Amerindian ethnic groups which have migrated from the United States – like the Cherokees and Kickapoos — and Guatemala during the 19th and 20th centuries. Municipalities in which indigenous peoples are located can keep their normative traditional systems in relation to the election of their municipal authorities. This system is known as *Usos y Costumbres*, roughly translated as \"customs and traditions\".\n\n\nAccording to official statistics —as reported by the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples or CDI— Amerindians make up 10–14%[131] of the country's population, more than half of them (5.4% of total population) speak an indigenous language and a tenth (1.2% of total population) do not speak Spanish.[132] Official statistics of the CDI[133] report that the states with the greatest percentage of people who speak an Amerindian language or identify as Amerindian are Yucatán (59%), Oaxaca (48%), Quintana Roo (39%), Chiapas (28%), Campeche (27%), Hidalgo (24%), Puebla (19%), Guerrero (17%), San Luis Potosí (15%) and Veracruz (15%). Oaxaca is the state with the greatest number of distinct indigenous peoples and languages in the country.\n\n\n\n### White Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Mexicans\n\n![](image)An 18th-century portrait of the Fagoaga Arozqueta family, an upper-class family of Basque descent from Mexico City.\nWhite Mexicans are Mexican citizens of full or majority European descent.[134] This ethnic group contrasts with the Afro-Mexican and Indigenous Mexican groups in the fact that phenotype (hair color, skin color etc.) is often used as the main criterion to delineate it.[135][136][134] Spaniards and other Europeans began arriving in Mexico during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and continued immigrating to the country during colonial and independent Mexico. According to 20th- and 21st-century academics, large scale intermixing between the European immigrants and the native Indigenous peoples would produce a Mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of Mexico's population by the time of the Mexican revolution.[137] However, according to church registers from the colonial times, the majority (73%) of Spanish men married with Spanish women. Said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics, such as European immigrants who arrived to Mexico being almost exclusively men or that \"pure Spanish\" people were all part of a small powerful elite as Spaniards were often the most numerous ethnic group in the colonial cities[138][139] as there were menial workers and people in poverty who were of complete Spanish origin.[140]\n\n\nEstimates of Mexico's white population differ greatly in both, methodology and percentages given, extra-official sources such as The World Factbook and Encyclopedia Britannica, which use the 1921 census results as the base of their estimations, calculate Mexico's White population as only 9%[141] or between one tenth to one fifth[142] (the results of the 1921 census, however, have been contested by various historians and deemed inaccurate).[101] Surveys that account for phenotypical traits and have performed actual field research suggest rather higher percentages: using the presence of blond hair as reference to classify a Mexican as white, the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico calculated the percentage of said ethnic group at 23%.[143] With a similar methodology, the American Sociological Association obtained a percentage of 18.8% having its higher frequency on the North region (22.3%–23.9%) followed by the Center region (18.4%–21.3%) and the South region (11.9%).[144]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ricardo Peralta y Fabi mechanical engineer and former astronaut trainee.\nAnother study made by the University College London in collaboration with Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History found that the frequencies of blond hair and light eyes in Mexicans are of 18% and 28% respectively,[84] surveys that use as reference skin color such as those made by Mexico's National Council to Prevent Discrimination and Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography reported a percentages of 47% in 2010[145][146][147] and 49% in 2017[148][149] respectively. A study performed in hospitals of Mexico City reported that an average 51.8% of Mexican newborns presented the congenital skin birthmark known as the Mongolian spot.[150] The Mongolian spot appears with a very high frequency (85–95%) in Asian, Native American, and African children.[151] The skin lesion reportedly almost always appears on South American[152] and Mexican children who are racially Mestizos,[153] while having a very low frequency (5–10%) in Caucasian children.[154] According to the Mexican Social Security Institute (shortened as IMSS) nationwide, around half of Mexican babies have the Mongolian spot.[155]\n\n\nMexico's northern and western regions have the highest percentages of European population, with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly European ancestry, resembling in aspect that of northern Spaniards.[156] In the north and west of Mexico, the indigenous populations were substantially smaller than those found in central and southern Mexico, and also much less organized, thus they remained isolated from the rest of the population or even in some cases were hostile towards Mexican colonists. The northeast region, in which the indigenous population was eliminated by early European settlers, became the region with the highest proportion of whites during the Spanish colonial period. However, recent immigrants from southern Mexico have been changing, to some degree, its demographic trends.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Mennonite family in Campeche.\nWhile the majority of European immigration to Mexico has been Spanish with the first wave starting with the colonization of America and the last one being a consequence of the Spanish Civil War of 1937,[157] immigrants from other European countries have arrived to Mexico as well: during the Second Mexican Empire the immigration was mostly French, and during the late 19th and early 20th centuries spurred by government policies of Porfirio Díaz, migrants mainly from Italy, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany followed taking advantage of the liberal policies then valid in Mexico and went into merchant, industrial and educational ventures while others arrived with no or limited capital, as employees or farmers.[158] Most settled in Mexico City, Veracruz, Yucatán, and Puebla. Significant numbers of German immigrants also arrived during and after the First and Second World Wars.[30][159] Additionally small numbers of White Americans, Croats, Greeks, Poles, Romanians, Russians and Ashkenazi Jews came.[159] The European Jewish immigrants joined the Sephardic community that lived in Mexico since colonial times, though many lived as Crypto-Jews, mostly in the northern states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas.[160] Some communities of European immigrants have remained isolated from the rest of the general population since their arrival, among them the German-speaking Mennonites from Russia of Chihuahua and Durango,[161] and the Venetos of Chipilo, Puebla, which have retained their original languages.[162]\n\n\nHowever, ethnicity in Mexico is not as clear cut as it is in the English speaking world, and \"mestizos\" are somewhat prone to identifying as \"white\" if asked. According to Pew Research, 60% of Mexicans identify as white when asked about their race.[163]\n\n\n\n### Afro-Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Afro-Mexicans\n\n![](image)Afromestiza girls in Cuajinicuilapa, Guerrero\n![Painting of Vicente Guerrero, major figure during the late Mexican War of Independence, abolitionist and second President of Mexico, was an Afro-Mexican.](image)Vicente Guerrero, major figure during the late Mexican War of Independence and second President of Mexico, was an Afro-descendent through his mother.[164]\nAfro-Mexicans are an ethnic group that predominate in certain areas of Mexico, such as the Costa Chica of Oaxaca and the Costa Chica of Guerrero, Veracruz (e.g. Yanga) and in some towns in northern Mexico. The existence of black people in Mexico is often unknown, denied or diminished both in Mexico and abroad for different reasons: their small numbers, continuous intermarriage and assimilation with non-African populations over various generations, as was often the case in Spanish territories and Mexico's tradition of defining itself as a \"mestizaje\" or mixing of European and indigenous. Mexico did have an active slave trade during the colonial period, but it wasn't as prominent as the one seen elsewhere in the Americas, which led to the number of free black people eventually surpassing that of enslaved ones. The institution was already in decay by the late 1700s and by the 19th century slavery and ethnic categorization at birth (see casta) have been abolished with the Mexican independence. After this the creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past, actively or passively eliminating its African one from popular consciousness.\n\n\nThe majority of Mexico's native Afro-descendants are *Afromestizos.* Individuals with significantly high amounts of African ancestry make up a very low percentage of the total Mexican population, the majority being recent black immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere in the Americas. According to the Intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government, Afro-Mexicans make up 2.4% of Mexico's population,[124] the Afro-Mexican category in the Intercensal survey includes people who self-identified solely as African and people who self-identified as partially African. The survey also states that 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous, with 9.3% being speakers of indigenous languages.[130]\n\n\nA number of black Mexicans descend from recent immigrants from Haiti, Africa, and rest of the Caribbean.\n\n\n\n### Arab Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arab Mexicans\n\n![](image)Susana Harp Mexican singer and currently serves as a senator.\nAn Arab Mexican is a Mexican citizen of Arabic-speaking origin who can be of various ancestral origins. The vast majority of Mexico's 1.1 million Arabs are from either Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, or Palestinian background.[31]\n\n\nThe interethnic marriage in the Arab community, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most community members have only one parent who has Arab ethnicity. As a result of this, the Arab community in Mexico shows marked language shift away from Arabic. Only a few speak any Arabic, and such knowledge is often limited to a few basic words. Instead the majority, especially those of younger generations, speak Spanish as a first language. Today, the most common Arabic surnames in Mexico include Nader, Hayek, Ali, Haddad, Nasser, Malik, Abed, Mansoor, Harb and Elias.\n\n\nArab immigration to Mexico started in the 19th and early 20th centuries.[165] Roughly 100,000 Arabic-speakers settled in Mexico during this time period. They came mostly from Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq and settled in significant numbers in Nayarit, Puebla, Mexico City and the northern part of the country (mainly in the states of Baja California, Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango, as well as the city of Tampico and Guadalajara. The term \"Arab Mexican\" may include ethnic groups that do not in fact identify as Arab.\n\n\n\n![](image)Engineer Carlos Slim\nDuring the Israel-Lebanon war in 1948 and during the Six-Day War, thousands of Lebanese left Lebanon and went to Mexico. They first arrived in Veracruz. Although Arabs made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity.[31]\n\n\nImmigration of Arabs in Mexico has influenced Mexican culture, in particular food, where they have introduced Kibbeh, Tabbouleh and even created recipes such as *Tacos Árabes*. By 1765, Dates, which originated from the Middle East, were introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards.[166] The fusion between Arab and Mexican food has highly influenced the Yucatecan cuisine.[167]\n\n\nAnother concentration of Arab-Mexicans is in Baja California facing the U.S.-Mexican border, esp. in cities of Mexicali in the Imperial Valley U.S./Mexico, and Tijuana across from San Diego with a large Arab American community (about 280,000), some of whose families have relatives in Mexico. 45% of Arab Mexicans are of Lebanese descent.\n\n\nThe majority of Arab-Mexicans are Christians who belong to the Maronite Church, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches.[168] A scant number are Muslims.\n\n\n\n#### Asian Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asian Mexicans\n\n![](image)Kavka Shishido drummer and vocalist.\nAlthough Asian Mexicans make up less than 1% of the total population of modern Mexico, they are nonetheless a notable minority. Due to the historical and contemporary perception in Mexican society of what constitutes Asian culture (associated with the Far East rather than the Near East), Asian Mexicans typically refers to those of East Asian descent, and may also include those of South and Southeast Asian descent. For Mexicans of West Asian descent, see the Middle Eastern Mexicans section.\n\n\nAsian immigration began with the arrival of Filipinos to Mexico during the Spanish period. For two and a half centuries, between 1565 and 1815, many Filipinos and Mexicans sailed to and from Mexico and the Philippines as sailors, crews, slaves, prisoners, adventurers and soldiers in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon assisting Spain in its trade between Asia and the Americas. Also on these voyages, thousands of Asian individuals (mostly males) were brought to Mexico as slaves and were called \"Chino\",[169] which means Chinese, although in reality they were of diverse origins, including Koreans, Japanese, Malays, Filipinos, Javanese, Cambodians, Timorese, and people from Bengal, India, Ceylon, Makassar, Tidore, Terenate, and China.[170][171][172] A notable example is the story of Catarina de San Juan (Mirra), an Indian girl captured by the Portuguese and sold into slavery in Manila. She arrived in New Spain and eventually she gave rise to the \"China Poblana\".\n\n\n\n![](image)Luis Nishizawa was a Mexican artist.\nThese early individuals are not very apparent in modern Mexico for two main reasons: the widespread *mestizaje* of Mexico during the Spanish period and the common practice of *Chino* slaves to \"pass\" as *Indios* (the indigenous people of Mexico) to attain freedom. As had occurred with a large portion of Mexico's black population, over generations the Asian populace was absorbed into the general Mestizo population. Facilitating this miscegenation was the assimilation of Asians into the indigenous population. The indigenous people were legally protected from chattel slavery, and by being recognized as part of this group, Asian slaves could claim they were wrongly enslaved.\n\n\nAsians, predominantly Chinese, became Mexico's fastest-growing immigrant group from the 1880s to the 1920s, exploding from about 1,500 in 1895 to more than 20,000 in 1910.[173]\n\n\n\n### Romani Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Romani Mexicans\n\nRomani people have settled in Mexico since the colonial era.[174] There are around 50,000 Vlax Romani in Mexico.[175]\n\n\n\n### Official censuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arcelia Ramírez Mexican actress\nHistorically, population studies and censuses have never been up to the standards that a population as diverse and numerous such as Mexico's require: the first racial census was made in 1793, being also Mexico's (then known as New Spain) first ever nationwide population census. Since only part of its original datasets survive, most of what is known of it comes from essays made by researchers who back in the day used the census' findings as reference for their own works. More than a century would pass until the Mexican government conducted a new racial census in 1921 (some sources assert that the census of 1895 included a comprehensive racial classification;[137] however, according to the historic archives of Mexico's National Institute of Statistics, that was not the case).[176] While the 1921 census was the last time the Mexican government conducted a census that included a comprehensive racial classification, in recent years it has conducted nationwide surveys to quantify most of the ethnic groups who inhabit the country as well as the social dynamics and inequalities between them.\n\n\n\n#### 1793 census[edit]\n\n\nAlso known as the \"Revillagigedo census\" from the name of the Count who ordered that it be conducted, this census was the first nationwide population census of Mexico (then known as the Viceroyalty of New Spain). Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, so most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works, such as Prussian geographer Alexander von Humboldt. Each author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country although they don't vary greatly, with Europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos from 21% to 25%, Indians from 51% to 61%, and Africans from 6,000 and 10,000. The estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded then, that across nearly three centuries of colonization, the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%–17% per century. The authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates, the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies in their suffering higher mortality rates due to living in remote locations rather than in cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or in being at war with them. For the same reasons, the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greatest variation range between publications, as in some cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted, leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others.[177]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Intendecy or territory\n | European population (%)\n | Indigenous population (%)\n | Mestizo population (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| México (only the State of Mexico and Mexico City)\n | 16.9%\n | 66.1%\n | 16.7%\n |\n| Puebla | 10.1%\n | 74.3%\n | 15.3%\n |\n| Oaxaca | 06.3%\n | 88.2%\n | 05.2%\n |\n| Guanajuato | 25.8%\n | 44.0%\n | 29.9%\n |\n| San Luis Potosí | 13.0%\n | 51.2%\n | 35.7%\n |\n| Zacatecas | 15.8%\n | 29.0%\n | 55.1%\n |\n| Durango | 20.2%\n | 36.0%\n | 43.5%\n |\n| Sonora | 28.5%\n | 44.9%\n | 26.4%\n |\n| Yucatán | 14.8%\n | 72.6%\n | 12.3%\n |\n| Guadalajara | 31.7%\n | 33.3%\n | 34.7%\n |\n| Veracruz | 10.4%\n | 74.0%\n | 15.2%\n |\n| Valladolid | 27.6%\n | 42.5%\n | 29.6%\n |\n| Nuevo México | ~\n | 30.8%\n | 69.0%\n |\n| Vieja California | ~\n | 51.7%\n | 47.9%\n |\n| Nueva California | ~\n | 89.9%\n | 09.8%\n |\n| Coahuila | 30.9%\n | 28.9%\n | 40.0%\n |\n| Nuevo León | 62.6%\n | 05.5%\n | 31.6%\n |\n| Nuevo Santander | 25.8%\n | 23.3%\n | 50.8%\n |\n| Texas | 39.7%\n | 27.3%\n | 32.4%\n |\n| Tlaxcala | 13.6%\n | 72.4%\n | 13.8%\n |\n\n\n~Europeans are included within the Mestizo category.\n\n\nRegardless of the possible inaccuracies related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside of the colonized areas, the effort that New Spain's authorities put into considering them as subjects is worth mentioning, as censuses made by other colonial or post-colonial countries did not consider American Indians to be citizens or subjects; for example, the censuses made by the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements.[178] Another example is the censuses made by the United States, which did not include Indigenous peoples living among the general population until 1860, and indigenous peoples as a whole until 1900.[179]\n\n\n\n#### 1921 census[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eulalio Gutiérrez (1881–1939), flanked by Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa (1878–1923) and Emiliano Zapata (1879–1919). Gutiérrez was appointed provisional President of Mexico by the Convention of Aguascalientes, a move that Venustiano Carranza (1859–1920) found intolerable. In the ensuing war, Obregón fought for Carranza against the convention.\nMade right after the consummation of the Mexican revolution, the social context in which this census was conducted makes it particularly unique, as the government of the time was in the process of rebuilding the country and was looking to unite all Mexicans in a single national identity. The 1921 census' final results in regards to race, which assert that 59.3% of the Mexican population self-identified as Mestizo, 29.1% as Indigenous, and only 9.8% as White, were then essential in cementing the *mestizaje* ideology (which asserts that the Mexican population as a whole is product of the admixture of all races), which shaped Mexican identity and culture through the 20th century and remains prominent nowadays, with extraofficial international publications such as *The World Factbook* and *Encyclopædia Britannica* using the 1921 census as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition up to this day.[93][113]\n\n\nNonetheless, in recent times, the census' results have been subjected to scrutiny by historians, academics and social activists alike, who assert that such drastic alterations on demographic trends with respect to the 1793 census are impossible and cite, among other statistics, the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico.[180] It is claimed that the *mestizaje* process sponsored by the state was more \"cultural than biological\", which resulted in the numbers of the Mestizo Mexican group being inflated at the expense of the identity of other races.[181] Controversies aside, this census constituted the last time the Mexican Government conducted a comprehensive racial census with the breakdown by states being the following (foreigners and people who answered \"other\" not included):[182]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Federative Units\n | Mestizo Population (%)\n | Amerindian Population (%)\n | White Population (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aguascalientes | 66.12%\n | 16.70%\n | 16.77%\n |\n| Baja California(Distrito Norte) | 72.50%\n | 07.72%\n | 00.35%\n |\n| Baja California(Distrito Sur) | 59.61%\n | 06.06%\n | 33.40%\n |\n| Campeche | 41.45%\n | 43.41%\n | 14.17%\n |\n| Coahuila | 77.88%\n | 11.38%\n | 10.13%\n |\n| Colima | 68.54%\n | 26.00%\n | 04.50%\n |\n| Chiapas | 36.27%\n | 47.64%\n | 11.82%\n |\n| Chihuahua | 50.09%\n | 12.76%\n | 36.33%\n |\n| Durango | 89.85%\n | 09.99%\n | 00.01%\n |\n| Guanajuato | 96.33%\n | 02.96%\n | 00.54%\n |\n| Guerrero | 54.05%\n | 43.84%\n | 02.07%\n |\n| Hidalgo | 51.47%\n | 39.49%\n | 08.83%\n |\n| Jalisco | 75.83%\n | 16.76%\n | 07.31%\n |\n| Mexico City | 54.78%\n | 18.75%\n | 22.79%\n |\n| State of Mexico | 47.71%\n | 42.13%\n | 10.02%\n |\n| Michoacán | 70.95%\n | 21.04%\n | 06.94%\n |\n| Morelos | 61.24%\n | 34.93%\n | 03.59%\n |\n| Nayarit | 73.45%\n | 20.38%\n | 05.83%\n |\n| Nuevo León | 75.47%\n | 05.14%\n | 19.23%\n |\n| Oaxaca | 28.15%\n | 69.17%\n | 01.43%\n |\n| Puebla | 39.34%\n | 54.73%\n | 05.66%\n |\n| Querétaro | 80.15%\n | 19.40%\n | 00.30%\n |\n| Quintana Roo | 42.35%\n | 20.59%\n | 15.16%\n |\n| San Luis Potosí | 61.88%\n | 30.60%\n | 05.41%\n |\n| Sinaloa | 98.30%\n | 00.93%\n | 00.19%\n |\n| Sonora | 41.04%\n | 14.00%\n | 42.54%\n |\n| Tabasco | 53.67%\n | 18.50%\n | 27.56%\n |\n| Tamaulipas | 69.77%\n | 13.89%\n | 13.62%\n |\n| Tlaxcala | 42.44%\n | 54.70%\n | 02.53%\n |\n| Veracruz | 50.09%\n | 36.60%\n | 10.28%\n |\n| Yucatán | 33.83%\n | 43.31%\n | 21.85%\n |\n| Zacatecas | 86.10%\n | 08.54%\n | 05.26%\n |\n\n\nWhen the 1921 census' results are compared with the results of Mexico's recent censuses[130] as well as with modern genetic research,[183] there is high consistency with respect to the distribution of Indigenous Mexicans across the country, with states located in south and south-eastern Mexico having both the highest percentages of population who self-identify as Indigenous and the highest percentages of Amerindian genetic ancestry. However, this is not the case when it comes to European Mexicans, as there are instances in which states that have been shown through scientific research to have a considerably high European ancestry are reported to have very small white populations in the 1921 census, with the most extreme case being that of the state of Durango, where the aforementioned census asserts that only 0.01% of the state's population (33 persons) self-identified as \"white\" while modern scientific research shows that the population of Durango has similar genetic frequencies to those found on European peoples (with the state's Indigenous population showing almost no foreign admixture either).[184] Various authors theorize that the reason for these inconsistencies may lie in the Mestizo identity promoted by the Mexican government, which reportedly led to people who are not biologically Mestizos to identify themselves as such.[107][185]\n\n\n\n#### The present day[edit]\n\n\nThe following table is a compilation of, when possible, official nationwide surveys conducted by the Mexican government which have attempted to quantify different Mexican ethnic groups. Given that, for the most part, each ethnic group was estimated by different surveys with different methodologies and years apart rather than on a single comprehensive racial census, some groups could overlap with others and be overestimated or underestimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Race or ethnicity\n | Population (est.)\n | Percentage (est.)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Indigenous | 26,000,000\n | 21.5%\n | 2015[130] |\n| Black | 2,576,213\n | 2.4%\n | 2020[186] |\n| White | 56,000,000\n | 47.0%\n | 2010[145][146][147] |\n| Foreigners residing in Mexico (of any race)\n | 1,010,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2015[187] |\n| East Asian | 1,000,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2010[188] |\n| Middle Eastern | 400,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2010[189] |\n| Jewish | 68,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2010[190] |\n| Muslim | 4,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2015[191] |\n| Unclassified (most likely Mestizos)\n | 37,300,000\n | 30.0%\n | –\n |\n| Total\n | 123,500,000\n | 100%\n | 2017[192] |\n\n\nOf all the ethnic groups that have been surveyed, Mestizos are notably absent, which is likely due to the label's fluid and subjective definition, which complicates its precise quantification. However it can be safely assumed that Mestizos make up at least the remaining 30% unassessed percentage of Mexico's population with possibilities of increasing if the methodologies of the extant surveys are considered. For example, the 2015 intercensal survey considered individuals who self-identified as \"part Indigenous\" or \"part African\" as part of a combined group of Indigenous Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans altogether. Such people technically would be Mestizos. Similarly, White Mexicans were quantified based on physical traits and appearance. Thus, technically a Mestizo with a percentage of Indigenous ancestry that was low enough to not affect his or her primarily European phenotype was considered to be white. Finally, the remaining ethnicities, relatively low in number, have more permissive classification criteria. Some of these ethnicities are faiths. Therefore, a Mestizo could claim to belong to one of them by practicing the faith, or by having an ancestor who belonged to at least one of these ethnicities.\nNonetheless, contemporary sociologists and historians agree that, given that the concept of \"race\" has a psychological foundation rather than a biological one, and that to society's eyes, a Mestizo with a high percentage of European ancestry is considered \"white\", and a Mestizo with a high percentage of Indigenous ancestry is considered \"Indian\", a person who identifies with a given ethnic group should be allowed to, even if biologically he or she doesn't completely belong to that group.[193]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Mexico\n\nLanguages in Mexico (by percentage):[194]\n\n\n\nSpanish (92.7%)\nSpanish and indigenous languages (5.7%)\nindigenous (0.8%)\nunspecified (0.8%)\n\nSpanish is the *de facto* official language in Mexico being spoken by 98.3% of the population.[195] Mexican Spanish is spoken in a variety of dialects, accents and variations in different regions across the country.\n\n\nSome indigenous languages are still being spoken by around 5% of Mexicans according to the latest census, in 2003 the General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples recognized 68 indigenous languages as \"national languages\", with the \"same validity\" in all territories and contexts where they are spoken. The indigenous language with the greatest number of speakers is Nahuatl (1,586,884 speakers in 2010 or 1.5% of the nation's population), followed by Yucatec Maya (796,405 speakers in 2010 0.8%) spoken Yucatán Peninsula, Mixtecas languages (494,454), Tzeltal (474,298), Zapotecas languages (460,683), Tzotzil (429,168), Otomí (288,052), Totonaca (250,252) Mazateco (230,124), Chol (222,051) and 1,462,857 speakers of other languages. After half a century of rural-to-urban migration, in Mexico City and other major cities large districts and sections use both written and spoken Amerindian languages.\n\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century the government promoted a policy of *castellanización*, that is, promoting the use of Spanish as a way to integrate indigenous peoples into Mexican society. Later, this policy changed, and since the 1980s the government has sponsored bilingual and intercultural education in all indigenous communities. This policy has mainly been successful in large communities with a significant number of speakers. While some languages, with less than 1,000 speakers, are still facing extinction.\n\n\nThe second most spoken language in Mexico, however, is English. It is used extensively at border areas, tourist centers and large metropolitan areas, a phenomenon arguably caused by the economic integration of North American under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the immigration phenomenon and the return of workers and their families from the United States.[196] In border cities, American TV and radio waves in English (and Spanish) are received as much Spanish-speaking radio and TV stations from Mexico on the US side of the border, thus a bilingual cross-cultural exchange is at work.\n\n\nAmong the languages brought to the country by immigrants are the Venetian of Chipilo, and Mennonite Low German spoken in Durango and Chihuahua.\n\n\n\n## Mexican nationality and citizenship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexican passport\nMain article: Mexican nationality law\n\nThe Constitution of Mexico grants Mexican nationality based on birth and naturalization. Mexican laws regarding nationality by birth are very open. Mexican nationality by birth is granted to:[197]\n\n\n\n* all those individuals born in Mexican territory,\n* all those individuals born outside Mexico, whose father or mother is Mexican by birth,\n* all those individuals born outside Mexico, whose father or mother is Mexican by naturalization,\n* all those individuals born aboard Mexican aircraft or sea vessels, whether warships or commercial vessels.\n\n\nMexican nationality by naturalization is granted to:[197]\n\n\n\n* foreign citizens granted Mexican nationality by the Secretariat of Government (Ministry of the Interior);\n* foreign citizens married to a Mexican national, whether by birth or naturalization.\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Mexico\n\nReligion in Mexico (by percentage):[194]\n\n\n\nRoman Catholic (82.7%)\nEvangelical Churches (5%)\nPentecostal (1.6%)\nJehovah's Witnesses (1.4%)\nother (1.9%)\nnone (4.7%)\nunspecified (2.7%)\n\nThe Mexican population is predominantly Catholic (78% of the population aged five and older, according to the 2020 census),[198] although the percentage representing those who attend church on a weekly basis is lower (46%).[199] About 7.6% of the population was classified as Protestant or Evangelical, 2.5% were classified as \"Non-Evangelical Biblical\" (a classification that groups Adventists, Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses), 0.05% as practicing Jews, and 4.6% without a religion.[200] The largest group of Protestants are Pentecostals and Charismatics (classified as Neo-Pentecostals).\n\n\n\n![](image)Church of Archangel Michael — from the town of Comala, in the state of Colima.\nThe states with the highest percentage of professing Catholics are central states, namely Guanajuato (96.4%), Aguascalientes (95.6%) and Jalisco (95.4%), whereas southeastern states have the lowest percentage of Catholics, namely Chiapas (63.8%), Tabasco (70.4%) and Campeche (71.3%).[200] The percentage of professing Catholics has been on the decrease over the last four decades, from over 98% in 1950 to 78% in 2020.[198] The average annual growth of Catholic believers from 1990 to 2000 was 1.7% whereas that of non-Catholics was 3.7%.[201] Given that the average annual population increase over the same time period was 1.8%,[202] the percentage of Catholics in relation to the total population continues to be in overall decline.\n\n\nSince 1857 with the La Reforma laws, the Mexican Constitution drastically separates Church and State, unlike some other countries in Latin America or Ibero-America. The State does not support or provide any economic resource to the Church (as is the case in Spain and Argentina),[203] and the Church cannot participate in public education (no public school can be operated by a Catholic order, although they can participate in private education). Moreover, the government nationalized all the Church's properties (some of which were given back in the 1990s), and priests lost the right to vote or to be voted for (although in the 1990s they regained the right to vote).\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of municipalities in Mexico by population\n* Metropolitan areas of Mexico\n* List of Mexican states by population\n* List of Mexican states by fertility rate\n* Economy of Mexico\n* Poverty in Mexico\n* Romani Mexicans\n\n\n## References and notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"People and Society\". *cia.gov*.

It is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world and the third-most populous country in the Americas after the United States and Brazil.[5] Throughout most of the 20th century Mexico's population was characterized by rapid growth. Although this tendency has been reversed and average annual population growth over the last five years was less than 1%, the demographic transition is still in progress; Mexico still has a large youth cohort. The most populous city in the country is the capital, Mexico City, with a population of 8.9 million (2016), and its metropolitan area is also the most populated with 20.1 million (2010). Approximately 50% of the population lives in one of the 55 large metropolitan areas in the country. In total, about 78.84% of the population of the country lives in urban areas, and only about 21.16% in rural ones.\n\n\nDemographic censuses are performed by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informatica. The National Population Council (CONAPO) is an institution under the Ministry of Interior in charge of the analysis and research of population dynamics. The National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (CDI), also undertakes research and analysis of the sociodemographic and linguistic indicators of the indigenous peoples.\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic dynamics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mexicans\n\n![](image)*Mestiza* woman clad in indigenous clothes\n![](image)Historical population of Mexico\n![](image)Population growth\n![](image)Mexican states by population density\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1865  | 8,259,080[6] | —     |\n| 1895  | 12,700,294 | +1.44% |\n| 1900  | 13,607,272 | +1.39% |\n| 1910  | 15,160,369 | +1.09% |\n| 1921  | 14,334,780 | −0.51% |\n| 1930  | 16,552,722 | +1.61% |\n| 1940  | 19,653,552 | +1.73% |\n| 1950  | 25,791,017 | +2.75% |\n| 1960  | 34,923,129 | +3.08% |\n| 1970  | 48,225,238 | +3.28% |\n| 1980  | 66,846,833 | +3.32% |\n| 1990  | 81,249,645 | +1.97% |\n| 2000  | 97,483,412 | +1.84% |\n| 2010  | 112,336,538 | +1.43% |\n| 2020  | 126,014,024 | +1.16% |\n| Source: INEGI |\n\n\nIn 1900, the Mexican population was 13.6 million.[7] During the period of economic prosperity that was dubbed by economists as the \"Mexican Miracle\", the government invested in efficient social programs that reduced the infant mortality rate and increased life expectancy. These measures jointly led to an intense demographic increase between 1930 and 1980. The population's annual growth rate has been reduced from a 3.5% peak in 1965 to 0.99% in 2005. While Mexico is now transitioning to the third phase of demographic transition, close to 50% of the population in 2009 was 25 years old or younger.[8] Fertility rates have also decreased from 5.7 children per woman in 1976 to 2.2 in 2006.[9] After decades of the gap narrowing, in 2020 the fertility rate in Mexico fell below the United States for the first time falling 22% in 2020 and a further 10.5% in the first half of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\nThe average annual population growth rate of Mexico City was 0.2%. The state with the lowest population growth rate over the same period was Michoacán (-0.1%), whereas the states with the highest population growth rates were Quintana Roo (4.7%) and Baja California Sur (3.4%),[11] both of which are two of the least populous states and the last to be admitted to the Union in the 1970s. The average annual net migration rate of Mexico City over the same period was negative and the lowest of all political divisions of Mexico, whereas the states with the highest net migration rate were Quintana Roo (2.7), Baja California (1.8) and Baja California Sur (1.6).[12] While the national annual growth rate was still positive (1.0%) in the early years of the 2000s, the national net migration rate was negative (-4.75/1000 inhabitants), given the former strong flow of immigrants to the United States; an estimated 5.3 million undocumented Mexican immigrants lived in the United States in 2004[13] and 18.2 million American citizens in the 2000 Census declared having Mexican ancestry.[14] However, as of recent years in the 2010s, the net migration rate reached 0, given the strong economy of Mexico, changes in US Immigration Policy & Enforcement, US Legislative and CFR-8 decisions, plus the (then) slowly recovering US economy, causing many of its former residents to return. The Mexican government projects[15] that the Mexican population will grow to about 123 million by 2042 and then start declining slowly. Assumptions underlying this projection include fertility stabilizing at 1.85 children per woman and continued high net emigration (slowly decreasing from 583,000 in 2005 to 393,000 in 2050).\n\n\nThe states and Mexico City that make up the Mexican federation are collectively called \"federal entities\". The five most populous federal entities in 2005 were the State of Mexico (14.4 million), Mexico City (8.7 million), Veracruz (7.1 million), Jalisco (6.7 million) and Puebla (5.4 million), which collectively contain 40.7% of the national population. Mexico City, being coextensive with the Mexico City, is the most populous city in the country, while Greater Mexico City, that includes the adjacent municipalities that comprise a metropolitan area, is estimated to be the second most populous in the world (after Tokyo), according to the UN Urbanization Report.\n\n\nIntense population growth in the northern states, especially along the US-Mexican border, changed the country's demographic profile in the second half of the 20th century, as the 1967 US-Mexico maquiladora agreement through which all products manufactured in the border cities could be imported duty-free to the US. Since the adoption of NAFTA in 1994, however, which allows all products to be imported duty-free regardless of their place of origin within Mexico, the non-border maquiladora share of exports has increased while that of border cities has decreased,.[16] This has led to decentralization and rapid economic growth in Mexican states (and cities), such as Quintana Roo (Cancun), Baja California Sur (La Paz), Nuevo León (Monterrey), Querétaro, and Aguascalientes. The population of each of these five states grew by more than one-third from 2000 to 2015, while the whole of Mexico grew by 22.6% in this period.\n\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexico's population pyramid (2017)\nAccording to the 2012 revision of the World Population Prospects, the total population was 117,886,000 in 2010, compared to only 28,296,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 30%, 64% of the population was between 15 and 65 years of age, and 6% was 65 years or older.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Total population (x 1000)\n | Proportionaged 0–14(%)\n | Proportionaged 15–64(%)\n | Proportionaged 65+(%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950\n | 28 296 | 42.5 | 54.1 | 3.5\n |\n| 1955\n | 33 401 | 44.5 | 52.2 | 3.3\n |\n| 1960\n | 38 677 | 45.9 | 50.8 | 3.4\n |\n| 1965\n | 45 339 | 46.8 | 49.6 | 3.5\n |\n| 1970\n | 52 988 | 46.6 | 49.7 | 3.7\n |\n| 1975\n | 61 708 | 46.2 | 50.1 | 3.7\n |\n| 1980\n | 70 353 | 44.7 | 51.5 | 3.8\n |\n| 1985\n | 77 859 | 42.1 | 53.9 | 3.9\n |\n| 1990\n | 86 077 | 38.5 | 57.2 | 4.3\n |\n| 1995\n | 95 393 | 35.9 | 59.6 | 4.5\n |\n| 2000\n | 103 874 | 34.1 | 61.0 | 4.9\n |\n| 2005\n | 110 732 | 32.3 | 62.4 | 5.3\n |\n| 2010\n | 117 886 | 30.0 | 64.0 | 6.0\n |\n| 2015\n | 127 017 | 27.6 | 65.9 | 6.5\n |\n| 2020\n | 134 837 | 25.6 | 66.9 | 7.6\n |\n\n\n### Structure of the population[edit]\n\n\nPopulation by Sex and Age Group (Census 12.VI.2010) (Including an estimation of 1 334 585 persons corresponding to 448 195 housing units without information of the occupants.):[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age Group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 54 855 231\n | 57 481 307\n | 112 336 538\n | 100\n |\n| 0–4\n | 5 346 943\n | 5 181 379\n | 10 528 322\n | 9.37\n |\n| 5–9\n | 5 604 175\n | 5 443 362\n | 11 047 537\n | 9.83\n |\n| 10–14\n | 5 547 613\n | 5 392 324\n | 10 939 937\n | 9.74\n |\n| 15–19\n | 5 520 121\n | 5 505 991\n | 11 026 112\n | 9.82\n |\n| 20–24\n | 4 813 204\n | 5 079 067\n | 9 892 271\n | 8.81\n |\n| 25–29\n | 4 205 975\n | 4 582 202\n | 8 788 177\n | 7.82\n |\n| 30–34\n | 4 026 031\n | 4 444 767\n | 8 470 798\n | 7.54\n |\n| 35–39\n | 3 964 738\n | 4 328 249\n | 8 292 987\n | 7.38\n |\n| 40–44\n | 3 350 322\n | 3 658 904\n | 7 009 226\n | 6.24\n |\n| 45–49\n | 2 824 364\n | 3 104 366\n | 5 928 730\n | 5.28\n |\n| 50–54\n | 2 402 451\n | 2 661 840\n | 5 064 291\n | 4.51\n |\n| 55–59\n | 1 869 537\n | 2 025 828\n | 3 895 365\n | 3.47\n |\n| 60–64\n | 1 476 667\n | 1 639 799\n | 3 116 466\n | 2.77\n |\n| 65–69\n | 1 095 273\n | 1 221 992\n | 2 317 265\n | 2.06\n |\n| 70–74\n | 873 893\n | 1 000 041\n | 1 873 934\n | 1.67\n |\n| 75–79\n | 579 689\n | 665 794\n | 1 245 483\n | 1.11\n |\n| 80–84\n | 355 277\n | 443 659\n | 798 936\n | 0.71\n |\n| 85–89\n | 197 461\n | 256 703\n | 454 164\n | 0.40\n |\n| 90–94\n | 68 130\n | 96 794\n | 164 924\n | 0.15\n |\n| 95–99\n | 25 920\n | 39 812\n | 65 732\n | 0.06\n |\n| 100+\n | 7 228\n | 11 247\n | 18 475\n | 0.02\n |\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Percent\n |\n| 0–14\n | 16 498 731\n | 16 017 065\n | 32 515 796\n | 28.94\n |\n| 15–64\n | 34 453 410\n | 37 031 013\n | 71 484 423\n | 63.63\n |\n| 65+\n | 3 202 871\n | 3 736 042\n | 6 938 913\n | 6.18\n |\n| unknown\n | 700 219\n | 697 187\n | 1 397 406\n | 1.24\n |\n\n\nPopulation by Sex and Age Group (Census 15.III.2020) (Including an estimation of 6 337 751 persons corresponding to 1 588 422 housing units without information of the occupants.):[19]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 61 473 390\n | 64 540 634\n | 126 014 024\n | 100\n |\n| 0–4\n | 5 077 482\n | 4 969 883\n | 10 047 365\n | 7.97\n |\n| 5–9\n | 5 453 091\n | 5 311 288\n | 10 764 379\n | 8.54\n |\n| 10–14\n | 5 554 260\n | 5 389 280\n | 10 943 540\n | 8.68\n |\n| 15–19\n | 5 462 150\n | 5 344 540\n | 10 806 690\n | 8.57\n |\n| 20–24\n | 5 165 884\n | 5 256 211\n | 10 422 095\n | 8.27\n |\n| 25–29\n | 4 861 404\n | 5 131 597\n | 9 993 001\n | 7.93\n |\n| 30–34\n | 4 527 726\n | 4 893 101\n | 9 420 827\n | 7.47\n |\n| 35–39\n | 4 331 530\n | 4 668 746\n | 9 020 276\n | 7.15\n |\n| 40–44\n | 4 062 304\n | 4 441 282\n | 8 503 586\n | 6.74\n |\n| 45–49\n | 3 812 344\n | 4 130 069\n | 7 942 413\n | 6.30\n |\n| 50–54\n | 3 332 163\n | 3 705 360\n | 7 037 532\n | 5.58\n |\n| 55–59\n | 2 692 976\n | 3 002 982\n | 5 695 958\n | 4.52\n |\n| 60–64\n | 2 257 862\n | 2 563 200\n | 4 821 062\n | 3.82\n |\n| 65–69\n | 1 706 850\n | 1 938 227\n | 3 645 077\n | 2.89\n |\n| 70–74\n | 1 233 492\n | 1 413 848\n | 2 647 340\n | 2.10\n |\n| 75–79\n | 847 898\n | 966 684\n | 1 814 582\n | 1.43\n |\n| 80–84\n | 523 812\n | 651 552\n | 1 175 364\n | 0.93\n |\n| 85+\n | 433 968\n | 605 583\n | 1 039 551\n | 0.82\n |\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Percent\n |\n| 0–14\n | 16 084 833\n | 15 670 451\n | 31 755 284\n | 25.20\n |\n| 15–64\n | 40 506 343\n | 43 157 097\n | 83 663 440\n | 66.39\n |\n| 65+\n | 4 746 020\n | 5 575 894\n | 10 321 914\n | 8.19\n |\n| unknown\n | 136 194\n | 137 192\n | 273 386\n | 0.22\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Non-Spanish immigrant groups included British, Irish, Italian, German, French and Dutch.[30] Large numbers of Middle Eastern immigrants arrived in Mexico during the same period, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.[31] Asian immigrants, mostly Chinese, some via the United States, settled in northern Mexico, whereas Koreans settled in central Mexico.[32]\n\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s Mexico opened its doors to immigrants from Latin America, mainly political refugees from Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Peru, Colombia and Central America. The PRI governments, in power for most of the 20th century, had a policy of granting asylum to fellow Latin Americans fleeing political persecution in their home countries. A second wave of immigrants has come to Mexico as a result of the economic crises experienced by some countries in the region. The Argentine community is quite significant estimated to be somewhere between 11,000 and 30,000.[33][34]\n\n\nDue to the 2008 Financial Crisis and the resulting economic decline and high unemployment in Spain, many Spaniards have been emigrating to Mexico to seek new opportunities.[35] For example, during the last quarter of 2012, a number of 7,630 work permits were granted to Spaniards.[36]\n\n\nMexico is also the country where the largest number of American citizens live abroad, with Mexico City playing host to the largest number of American citizens abroad in the world. The American Citizens Abroad Association estimated in 1999 that a little more than one million Americans live in Mexico (which represent 1% of the population in Mexico and 25% of all American citizens living abroad).[37] This immigration phenomenon could well be explained by the interaction of both countries under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but also by the fact that Mexico has become a popular destination for retirees, especially the small towns: just in the State of Guanajuato, in San Miguel de Allende and its surroundings, 10,000 Americans have their residence.[38]\n\n\nDiscrepancies between the figures of official legal aliens and all foreign-born residents is quite large. The official figure for foreign-born residents in Mexico in 2000 was 493,000,[39] with a majority (86.9%) of these born in the United States (except Chiapas, where the majority of immigrants are from Central America). The six states with the most immigrants are Baja California (12.1% of total immigrants), Mexico City (11.4%), Jalisco (9.9%), Chihuahua (9%) and Tamaulipas (7.3%).[39]\n\n\n\n### Emigration from Mexico[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Trend of Mexican migration to the United States. Here the term immigrant refers to those who were not born in the U.S. but are now currently residing in the U.S. This can include naturalized U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, employees and students on visas, and the undocumented.[40]\nThe national net migration rate of Mexico is negative, estimated at -1.8 migrants per 1,000 population as of 2017[update].[41]\nThe great majority of Mexican emigrants have moved to the United States of America. This migration phenomenon is not new, but it has been a defining feature in the relationship of both countries for most of the 20th century.[42] During World Wars I and II, the United States government approved the recruitment of Mexican workers in their territory, and tolerated unauthorized migration to obtain additional farm- and industrial-workers to fill the necessary spots vacated by the population in war, and to supply the increase in the demand for labor. Nonetheless, the United States unilaterally ended the wartime programs – in part as a result of arguments from labor and from civil-rights groups.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The San Ysidro Port of Entry is the fourth busiest border checkpoint in the world. Most traffic is related to commerce or day workers, rather than immigration.\nIn spite of that, emigration of Mexicans continued throughout the rest of the 20th century at varying rates. It grew significantly during the 1990s and continued to do so in the first years of the 2000s. In fact, it has been estimated that 37% of all Mexican immigrants to the United States in the 20th century arrived during the 1990s.[42] In 2000 approximately 20 million American residents identified themselves as either Mexican, Mexican-Americans or of Mexican origin, making \"Mexican\" the sixth-most cited ancestry of all US residents.[44]\n\n\nIn 2000 the INEGI estimated that about eight million Mexican-born people, which then was equivalent to 8.7% of the population of Mexico itself, lived in the United States of America.[45] In that year, the Mexican states sending the greatest numbers of emigrants to the United States were Jalisco (170,793), Michoacán (165,502), and Guanajuato (163,338); the total number of Mexican emigrants to the United States in 2000, both legal and illegal, was estimated at 1,569,157; the great majority of these were men.[46] Approximately 30% of emigrants come from rural communities.[47] In 2000, 260,650 emigrants returned to Mexico.[48] According to the Pew Hispanic Center in 2006, an estimated ten percent of all Mexican citizens lived in the United States.[49] The population of Mexican immigrants residing illegally in the United States fell from around seven million in 2007 to about 6.1 million in 2011.[50] This trajectory has been linked[*by whom?*] to the economic downturn which started in 2008 and which reduced available jobs, and to the introduction of stricter immigration laws in many States.[51][52][53][54] According to the Pew Hispanic Center the total number of Mexican-born people had stagnated in 2010 and then began to fall.[55]\n\n\nAfter the Mexican-American community, Mexican Canadians are the second-largest group of emigrant Mexicans, with a population of over 50,000.[56] A significant but unknown number of mestizos of Mexican descent migrated to the Philippines during the era of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, when the Philippines was a territory under the rule of Mexico city.[57] Mexicans live throughout Latin America as well as in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Emigration list from Mexico[58]Mexican residents in the world by countries\n |\n| --- |\n| Country\n | Population\n | Position\n | Continent\n |\n| ![](image) United States | 36,300,000[59] | 1 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Canada | 90,585[60] | 2 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 56,757[61] | 3 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Guatemala | 14,481[62] | 4 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Bolivia | 13,377[63] | 5 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 8,848[64] | 6 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 6,750[65] | 7 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 5,125[66] | 8 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Australia | 4,872[67] | 9 | Oceania\n |\n| ![](image) France | 4,601[68] | 10 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Israel | 4,252[69] | 11 | Asia\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 3,758[70] | 12 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 3,485[70] | 13 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Venezuela | 3,075[71] | 14 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 2,794[72] | 15 | Europe\n |\n| ![](image) Belize | 2,349[73] | 16 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Costa Rica | 2,327[74] | 17 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Panama | 2,299[75] | 18 | North America\n |\n| ![](image) Colombia | 2,286[76] | 19 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Chile | 1,874[77] | 20 | South America\n |\n| ![](image) Paraguay | 1,778[78] | 21 | South America\n |\n| The list includes also temporary residents (1–3 years' stay) |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMexican diaspora\n |\n| --- |\n| Americas | * Argentina\n* Belize\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n* Chile\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* El Salvador\n* Guatemala\n* Honduras\n* Panama\n* Paraguay\n* United States\n |\n| Asia | * Israel\n* Japan\n* Philippines\n |\n| Europe | * France\n* Germany\n* Italy\n* Netherlands\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* United Kingdom\n |\n| Oceania | * Australia\n* New Zealand\n |\n\n## Cities and metropolitan areas[edit]\n\n\n### Settlements, cities and municipalities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities in Mexico\n\nSee also: Municipalities of Mexico\n\n\n\n| Most populated municipalities\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| *Municipality of Guadalajara* |\n| Municipality\n | Pop.

A city is defined to be a settlement with more than 2,500 inhabitants. In 2005 there were 2,640 cities with a population between 2,500 and 15,000 inhabitants, 427 with a population between 15,000 and 100,000 inhabitants, 112 with a population between 100,000 and one million, and 11 with a population of more than one million.[79] All cities are considered \"urban areas\" and represent 76.5% of total population. Settlements with less than 2,500 inhabitants are considered \"rural communities\" (in fact, more than 80,000 of those settlements have only one or two housing units). Rural population in Mexico is 22.2% of total population.[79]\n\n\nMunicipalities (*municipios* in Spanish) and boroughs (*delegaciones* in Spanish) are incorporated places in Mexico, that is, second or third-level political divisions with internal autonomy, legally prescribed limits, powers and functions. In terms of second-level political divisions there are 2,438 municipalities and Mexico and 16 semi-autonomous boroughs (all within the Federal District). A municipality can be constituted by one or more cities one of which is the *cabecera municipal* (municipal seat). Cities are usually contained within the limits of a single municipality, with a few exceptions in which small areas of one city may extend to other adjacent municipalities *without* incorporating the city which serves as the municipal seat of the adjacent municipality. Some municipalities or cities within municipalities are further divided into *delegaciones* or boroughs. However, unlike the boroughs of the Federal District, these are third-level administrative divisions; they have very limited autonomy and no elective representatives.\n\n\nMunicipalities in central Mexico are usually very small in area and thus coextensive with cities (as is the case of Guadalajara, Puebla and León), whereas municipalities in northern and southeastern Mexico are much larger and usually contain more than one city or town that may not necessarily conform a single urban agglomeration (as is the case of Tijuana).\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan areas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Metropolitan areas of Mexico\n\n![](image)Mexican woman from Ajuchitlán del Progreso, a Nahua area, (2021).\nA metropolitan area in Mexico is defined to be the group of municipalities that heavily interact with each other, usually around a core city.[80] In 2004, a joint effort between CONAPO, INEGI and the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL) agreed to define metropolitan areas as either:[80]\n\n\n\n* the group of two or more municipalities in which a city with a population of at least 50,000 is located whose urban area extends over the limit of the municipality that originally contained the core city incorporating either physically or under its area of direct influence other adjacent predominantly urban municipalities all of which have a high degree of social and economic integration or are relevant for urban politics and administration; or\n* a single municipality in which a city of a population of at least one million is located and fully contained, (that is, it does not transcend the limits of a single municipality); or\n* a city with a population of at least 250,000 which forms a conurbation with other cities in the United States of America.\n\n\nIn 2004 there were 55 metropolitan areas in Mexico, in which close to 53% of the country's population lives. The most populous metropolitan area in Mexico is the *Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico*, or Greater Mexico City, which in 2005 had a population of 19.23 million, or 19% of the nation's population. The next four largest metropolitan areas in Mexico are Greater Guadalajara (4.1 million), Greater Monterrey (3.7 million), Greater Puebla (2.1 million) and Greater Toluca (1.6 million),[81] whose added population, along with Greater Mexico City, is equivalent to 30% of the nation's population. Greater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country since the 1930s until the late 1980s. Since then, the country has slowly become economically and demographically less centralized. From 2000 to 2005 the average annual growth rate of Greater Mexico City was the lowest of the five largest metropolitan areas, whereas the fastest growing metropolitan area was Puebla (2.0%) followed by Monterrey (1.9%), Toluca (1.8%) and Guadalajara (1.8%).[81]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in Mexico2020 National Population Census[82]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Valley of Mexico](image)Valley of Mexico![Monterrey](image)Monterrey | 1 | Valley of Mexico | Mexico City, State of Mexico, Hidalgo | 21,804,515 | 11 | Aguascalientes | Aguascalientes | 1,225,432\n | ![Guadalajara](image)Guadalajara![Puebla–Tlaxcala](image)Puebla–Tlaxcala |\n| 2 | Monterrey | Nuevo León | 5,341,171 | 12 | San Luis Potosí | San Luis Potosí | 1,221,526\n |\n| 3 | Guadalajara | Jalisco | 5,286,642 | 13 | Mérida | Yucatán | 1,201,000\n |\n| 4 | Puebla–Tlaxcala | Puebla, Tlaxcala | 3,199,530 | 14 | Mexicali | Baja California | 1,031,779\n |\n| 5 | Toluca | State of Mexico | 2,353,924 | 15 | Saltillo | Coahuila | 1,031,779\n |\n| 6 | Tijuana | Baja California | 2,157,853 | 16 | Cuernavaca | Morelos | 1,028,589\n |\n| 7 | León | Guanajuato | 1,924,771 | 17 | Culiacán | Sinaloa | 1,003,530\n |\n| 8 | Querétaro | Querétaro | 1,594,212 | 18 | Morelia | Michoacán | 988,704\n |\n| 9 | Juárez | Chihuahua | 1,512,450 | 19 | Chihuahua | Chihuahua | 988,065\n |\n| 10 | La Laguna | Coahuila, Durango | 1,434,283 | 20 | Veracruz | Veracruz | 939,046\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Other demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mexican mestizo population is the most diverse of all the mestizo groups of Latin America, with its mestizos being either largely European or Amerindian rather than having a uniform admixture.[83] Distribution of Admixture Estimates for Individuals from Mexico City and Quetalmahue (indigenous community in Chile).\n![](image)Regional variation of ancestry according to a study made by Ruiz-Linares in 2014, each dot represents a volunteer, with most coming from south Mexico and Mexico City.[84]\n![](image)Trivate for ancestry, from the same study as the image above.[84]\nDemographic statistics according to the 2022 World Population Review.[85]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 15 seconds\n* One death every 39 seconds\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 24 seconds\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[86]\n\n\n\n### Median age[edit]\n\n\ntotal: 29.3 years.

The second article of the Mexican Constitution defines the country to be a pluricultural state originally based on its indigenous peoples.\n\n\nRegardless of ethnicity, the majority of Mexicans are united under the same national identity.[87] This is the product of an ideology strongly promoted by Mexican academics such as Manuel Gamio and José Vasconcelos known as mestizaje, whose goal was that of Mexico becoming a racially and culturally homogeneous country.[88][87][89] The ideology's influence was reflected in Mexico's national censuses of 1921 and 1930: in the former, which was Mexico's first-ever national census (but second-ever if the census made in colonial times is taken into account)[90] that considered race, approximately 60% of Mexico's population identified as Mestizos,[91] and in the latter, Mexico's government declared that all Mexicans were now Mestizos, for which racial classifications would be dropped in favor of language-based ones in future censuses.[92] During most of the 20th century these censuses' results were taken as fact, with extraofficial international publications often using them as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition,[93][94][95] but in recent time historians and academics have claimed that said results are not accurate, as in its efforts to homogenize Mexico, the government inflated the Mestizo label's percentage by classifying a good number of people as such regardless of whether they were of actual mixed ancestry or not,[96][97][98][99] pointing out that an alteration so drastic of population trends compared to earlier censuses such as New Spain's 1793 census (on which Europeans were estimated to be 18% to 22% of the population, Mestizos 21% to 25% and Indigenous peoples 51% to 61%)[90] is not possible and that the frequency of marriages between people of different ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico was low.[100][101] It is also observed that when asked directly about their ethno-racial identification, many Mexicans nowadays do not identify as Mestizos,[102] would not agree to be labeled as such,[103] and that \"static\" ethnoracial labels such as \"White\" “Black” or \"Indian\" are far more prominent in contemporary Mexican society than the \"Mestizo\" one is, whose use is mostly limited to intellectual circles, a result of the label's constantly-changing and subjective definition.[104]\n\n\n\n### Mestizo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mestizos in Mexico\n\n![](image)President Porfirio Diaz was of Mestizo descent\nA large majority of Mexicans have been classified as \"Mestizos\", meaning in modern Mexican usage that they identify fully neither with any indigenous culture nor with a Spanish cultural heritage, but rather identify as having cultural traits incorporating elements from both indigenous and Spanish traditions. By the deliberate efforts of post-revolutionary governments, the \"Mestizo identity\" was constructed as the base of the modern Mexican national identity, through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as *mestizaje* [mestiˈsaxe]. Mexican politicians and reformers such as José Vasconcelos and Manuel Gamio were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity upon this concept.[105][106]\n\n\nSince the Mestizo identity promoted by the government is more of a cultural identity than a biological one it has achieved a strong influence in the country, a good number of phenotypically white people identifying with it, leading to being considered Mestizos in Mexico's demographic investigations and censuses due to the ethnic criteria having its base on cultural traits rather than biological ones.[107] A similar situation occurs regarding the distinctions between Indigenous peoples and Mestizos: while the term *Mestizo* is sometimes used in English with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and European blood, In Mexican society an indigenous person can be considered mestizo.[108] and a person with none or a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage.[109][110][111] In the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo has a different meaning, with it being to refer to the Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the caste war of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as Mestizos.[99] In Chiapas the word \"Ladino\" is used instead of mestizo.[112]\n\n\n\n![](image)Diego Boneta Mexican actor and singer.\nGiven that the word Mestizo has different meanings in Mexico, estimates of the Mexican Mestizo population vary widely. According to the *Encyclopædia Britannica*, which uses a biology-based approach, between one half and two-thirds of the Mexican population is Mestizo[113] whereas a culture-based criteria estimates a percentage as high as 90%.[92] Recent research based on self-identification nonetheless, has observed that many Mexicans do not identify as mestizos[102] and would not agree to be labeled as such,[103] with \"static\" racial labels such as White, Indian, Black etc. being more commonly used.[104]\n\n\n\n![](image)Climate activist Xiye Bastida, daughter of an Otomi father and Celtic mother.\nThe use of variated methods and criteria to quantify the number of Mestizos in Mexico is not new: Since several decades ago, many authors have analyzed colonial censuses data and have made different conjectures respecting the ethnic composition of the population of colonial Mexico/New Spain. There are Historians such as Gonzalo Aguirre-Beltrán who claimed in 1972 that practically the totality of New Spain's population, in reality, were Mestizos, using to back up his claims arguments such as that affairs of Spaniards with non-Europeans due to the alleged absence of female European immigrants were widespread as well as there being a huge desire of Mestizos to \"pass\" as Spaniards, this because Spanishness was seen as a symbol of high status.[114][115] Other historians however, point that Aguirre-Beltran numbers tend to have inconsistencies and take too much liberties (it is pointed out in the book *Ensayos sobre historia de la población. México y el Caribe 2* published in 1998 that on 1646, when according to historic registers the mestizo population was of 1% he estimates it to be 16.6% already, with this being attributed to him interpreting the data in a way convenient for a historic narrative),[116][97] often omitting data of New Spain's northern and western provinces.[117] His self-made classifications thus, although could be plausible, are not useful for precise statistical analysis.[118] According 21st-century historians, Aguirre Beltran also disregards facts such as the population dynamics of New Spain being different depending on the region at hand (i.e. miscegenation couldn't happen in a significant amount in regions on which the native population was openly hostile until early 20th century, such as most of New Spain's internal provinces, which nowadays are the northern and western regions of Mexico),[97] or that historic accounts made by investigators at the time consistently observed that New Spain's European population was notoriously concerned with preserving their European heritage, with practices such as inviting relatives and friends directly from Spain or favoring Europeans for marriage even if they were from a lower socioeconomic level than them being common.[119][116][97] Newer publications that do cite Aguirre-Beltran's work take those factors into consideration, stating that the Spaniard/Euromestizo/Criollo ethnic label was composed on its majority by descendants of Europeans albeit the category may have included people with some non-European ancestry.[120]\n\n\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples of Mexico\n\n![](image)President Benito Juarez was of Zapotec ancestry. He became the first Amerindian president in the Americas.\nPrior to contact with Europeans the indigenous people of Mexico had not had any kind of shared identity.[121] Indigenous identity was constructed by the dominant Euro-Mestizo majority and imposed upon the indigenous people as a negatively defined identity, characterized by the lack of assimilation into modern Mexico. Indigenous identity therefore became socially stigmatizing.[122] Cultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to help indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the rest of society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to Mestizo Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the \"Indian problem\" by transforming indigenous communities into mestizo communities.[123]\n\n\n\n![](image)Actress Yalitza Aparicio, daughter of a Mixtec father and Triqui mother.\nThe category of \"indígena\" (indigenous) in Mexico has been defined based on different criteria throughout history. This means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as \"indigenous\" varies according to the definition applied. It can be defined narrowly according to a linguistic criterion, including only persons that speak an Indigenous language. Based on this criterion, approximately 6.1% of the population is Indigenous.[124][125] Nonetheless, activists for the rights of indigenous peoples have referred to the usage of this criterion for census purposes as \"statistical genocide.\"[126][127]  \n Other surveys made by the Mexican government do count as Indigenous all persons who speak an indigenous language and people who do not speak indigenous languages nor live in indigenous communities but self-identify as Indigenous.\n\n\nAccording to these criteria, the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography), state that there are 15.7 million indigenous people in Mexico of many different ethnic groups,[128] which constitute 14.9% of the population in the country.[129]  \n Finally, according to the latest intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government in 2015, Indigenous people make up 21.5% of Mexico's population. In this occasion, people who self-identified as \"Indigenous\" and people who self-identified as \"partially Indigenous\" were classified in the \"Indigenous\" category altogether.[130]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Largest indigenous peoples\n |\n| --- |\n| *Mayas in Chiapas* |\n| Group\n | Number\n |\n| Nahua peoples (Nawatlaka)\n | 2,445,969\n |\n| Maya (Maaya)\n | 1,475,575\n |\n| Zapotec (Binizaa)\n | 777,253\n |\n| Mixtec (Ñuu sávi)\n | 726,601\n |\n| Otomí (Hñähñü)\n | 646,875\n |\n| Totonac (Tachihuiin)\n | 411,266\n |\n| Source: CDI (2000) [4] Archived September 15, 2019, at the Wayback Machine |\n\n\nThe Mexican constitution not only recognizes the 62 indigenous peoples living in Mexican territory but also grants them autonomy and protects their culture and languages. This protection and autonomy is extended to those Amerindian ethnic groups which have migrated from the United States – like the Cherokees and Kickapoos — and Guatemala during the 19th and 20th centuries. Municipalities in which indigenous peoples are located can keep their normative traditional systems in relation to the election of their municipal authorities. This system is known as *Usos y Costumbres*, roughly translated as \"customs and traditions\".\n\n\nAccording to official statistics —as reported by the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples or CDI— Amerindians make up 10–14%[131] of the country's population, more than half of them (5.4% of total population) speak an indigenous language and a tenth (1.2% of total population) do not speak Spanish.[132] Official statistics of the CDI[133] report that the states with the greatest percentage of people who speak an Amerindian language or identify as Amerindian are Yucatán (59%), Oaxaca (48%), Quintana Roo (39%), Chiapas (28%), Campeche (27%), Hidalgo (24%), Puebla (19%), Guerrero (17%), San Luis Potosí (15%) and Veracruz (15%). Oaxaca is the state with the greatest number of distinct indigenous peoples and languages in the country.\n\n\n\n### White Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Mexicans\n\n![](image)An 18th-century portrait of the Fagoaga Arozqueta family, an upper-class family of Basque descent from Mexico City.\nWhite Mexicans are Mexican citizens of full or majority European descent.[134] This ethnic group contrasts with the Afro-Mexican and Indigenous Mexican groups in the fact that phenotype (hair color, skin color etc.) is often used as the main criterion to delineate it.[135][136][134] Spaniards and other Europeans began arriving in Mexico during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and continued immigrating to the country during colonial and independent Mexico. According to 20th- and 21st-century academics, large scale intermixing between the European immigrants and the native Indigenous peoples would produce a Mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of Mexico's population by the time of the Mexican revolution.[137] However, according to church registers from the colonial times, the majority (73%) of Spanish men married with Spanish women. Said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics, such as European immigrants who arrived to Mexico being almost exclusively men or that \"pure Spanish\" people were all part of a small powerful elite as Spaniards were often the most numerous ethnic group in the colonial cities[138][139] as there were menial workers and people in poverty who were of complete Spanish origin.[140]\n\n\nEstimates of Mexico's white population differ greatly in both, methodology and percentages given, extra-official sources such as The World Factbook and Encyclopedia Britannica, which use the 1921 census results as the base of their estimations, calculate Mexico's White population as only 9%[141] or between one tenth to one fifth[142] (the results of the 1921 census, however, have been contested by various historians and deemed inaccurate).[101] Surveys that account for phenotypical traits and have performed actual field research suggest rather higher percentages: using the presence of blond hair as reference to classify a Mexican as white, the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico calculated the percentage of said ethnic group at 23%.[143] With a similar methodology, the American Sociological Association obtained a percentage of 18.8% having its higher frequency on the North region (22.3%–23.9%) followed by the Center region (18.4%–21.3%) and the South region (11.9%).[144]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ricardo Peralta y Fabi mechanical engineer and former astronaut trainee.\nAnother study made by the University College London in collaboration with Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History found that the frequencies of blond hair and light eyes in Mexicans are of 18% and 28% respectively,[84] surveys that use as reference skin color such as those made by Mexico's National Council to Prevent Discrimination and Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography reported a percentages of 47% in 2010[145][146][147] and 49% in 2017[148][149] respectively. A study performed in hospitals of Mexico City reported that an average 51.8% of Mexican newborns presented the congenital skin birthmark known as the Mongolian spot.[150] The Mongolian spot appears with a very high frequency (85–95%) in Asian, Native American, and African children.[151] The skin lesion reportedly almost always appears on South American[152] and Mexican children who are racially Mestizos,[153] while having a very low frequency (5–10%) in Caucasian children.[154] According to the Mexican Social Security Institute (shortened as IMSS) nationwide, around half of Mexican babies have the Mongolian spot.[155]\n\n\nMexico's northern and western regions have the highest percentages of European population, with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly European ancestry, resembling in aspect that of northern Spaniards.[156] In the north and west of Mexico, the indigenous populations were substantially smaller than those found in central and southern Mexico, and also much less organized, thus they remained isolated from the rest of the population or even in some cases were hostile towards Mexican colonists. The northeast region, in which the indigenous population was eliminated by early European settlers, became the region with the highest proportion of whites during the Spanish colonial period. However, recent immigrants from southern Mexico have been changing, to some degree, its demographic trends.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Mennonite family in Campeche.\nWhile the majority of European immigration to Mexico has been Spanish with the first wave starting with the colonization of America and the last one being a consequence of the Spanish Civil War of 1937,[157] immigrants from other European countries have arrived to Mexico as well: during the Second Mexican Empire the immigration was mostly French, and during the late 19th and early 20th centuries spurred by government policies of Porfirio Díaz, migrants mainly from Italy, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany followed taking advantage of the liberal policies then valid in Mexico and went into merchant, industrial and educational ventures while others arrived with no or limited capital, as employees or farmers.[158] Most settled in Mexico City, Veracruz, Yucatán, and Puebla. Significant numbers of German immigrants also arrived during and after the First and Second World Wars.[30][159] Additionally small numbers of White Americans, Croats, Greeks, Poles, Romanians, Russians and Ashkenazi Jews came.[159] The European Jewish immigrants joined the Sephardic community that lived in Mexico since colonial times, though many lived as Crypto-Jews, mostly in the northern states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas.[160] Some communities of European immigrants have remained isolated from the rest of the general population since their arrival, among them the German-speaking Mennonites from Russia of Chihuahua and Durango,[161] and the Venetos of Chipilo, Puebla, which have retained their original languages.[162]\n\n\nHowever, ethnicity in Mexico is not as clear cut as it is in the English speaking world, and \"mestizos\" are somewhat prone to identifying as \"white\" if asked. According to Pew Research, 60% of Mexicans identify as white when asked about their race.[163]\n\n\n\n### Afro-Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Afro-Mexicans\n\n![](image)Afromestiza girls in Cuajinicuilapa, Guerrero\n![Painting of Vicente Guerrero, major figure during the late Mexican War of Independence, abolitionist and second President of Mexico, was an Afro-Mexican.](image)Vicente Guerrero, major figure during the late Mexican War of Independence and second President of Mexico, was an Afro-descendent through his mother.[164]\nAfro-Mexicans are an ethnic group that predominate in certain areas of Mexico, such as the Costa Chica of Oaxaca and the Costa Chica of Guerrero, Veracruz (e.g. Yanga) and in some towns in northern Mexico. The existence of black people in Mexico is often unknown, denied or diminished both in Mexico and abroad for different reasons: their small numbers, continuous intermarriage and assimilation with non-African populations over various generations, as was often the case in Spanish territories and Mexico's tradition of defining itself as a \"mestizaje\" or mixing of European and indigenous. Mexico did have an active slave trade during the colonial period, but it wasn't as prominent as the one seen elsewhere in the Americas, which led to the number of free black people eventually surpassing that of enslaved ones. The institution was already in decay by the late 1700s and by the 19th century slavery and ethnic categorization at birth (see casta) have been abolished with the Mexican independence. After this the creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past, actively or passively eliminating its African one from popular consciousness.\n\n\nThe majority of Mexico's native Afro-descendants are *Afromestizos.* Individuals with significantly high amounts of African ancestry make up a very low percentage of the total Mexican population, the majority being recent black immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere in the Americas. According to the Intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government, Afro-Mexicans make up 2.4% of Mexico's population,[124] the Afro-Mexican category in the Intercensal survey includes people who self-identified solely as African and people who self-identified as partially African. The survey also states that 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous, with 9.3% being speakers of indigenous languages.[130]\n\n\nA number of black Mexicans descend from recent immigrants from Haiti, Africa, and rest of the Caribbean.\n\n\n\n### Arab Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arab Mexicans\n\n![](image)Susana Harp Mexican singer and currently serves as a senator.\nAn Arab Mexican is a Mexican citizen of Arabic-speaking origin who can be of various ancestral origins. The vast majority of Mexico's 1.1 million Arabs are from either Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, or Palestinian background.[31]\n\n\nThe interethnic marriage in the Arab community, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most community members have only one parent who has Arab ethnicity. As a result of this, the Arab community in Mexico shows marked language shift away from Arabic. Only a few speak any Arabic, and such knowledge is often limited to a few basic words. Instead the majority, especially those of younger generations, speak Spanish as a first language. Today, the most common Arabic surnames in Mexico include Nader, Hayek, Ali, Haddad, Nasser, Malik, Abed, Mansoor, Harb and Elias.\n\n\nArab immigration to Mexico started in the 19th and early 20th centuries.[165] Roughly 100,000 Arabic-speakers settled in Mexico during this time period. They came mostly from Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq and settled in significant numbers in Nayarit, Puebla, Mexico City and the northern part of the country (mainly in the states of Baja California, Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango, as well as the city of Tampico and Guadalajara. The term \"Arab Mexican\" may include ethnic groups that do not in fact identify as Arab.\n\n\n\n![](image)Engineer Carlos Slim\nDuring the Israel-Lebanon war in 1948 and during the Six-Day War, thousands of Lebanese left Lebanon and went to Mexico. They first arrived in Veracruz. Although Arabs made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity.[31]\n\n\nImmigration of Arabs in Mexico has influenced Mexican culture, in particular food, where they have introduced Kibbeh, Tabbouleh and even created recipes such as *Tacos Árabes*. By 1765, Dates, which originated from the Middle East, were introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards.[166] The fusion between Arab and Mexican food has highly influenced the Yucatecan cuisine.[167]\n\n\nAnother concentration of Arab-Mexicans is in Baja California facing the U.S.-Mexican border, esp. in cities of Mexicali in the Imperial Valley U.S./Mexico, and Tijuana across from San Diego with a large Arab American community (about 280,000), some of whose families have relatives in Mexico. 45% of Arab Mexicans are of Lebanese descent.\n\n\nThe majority of Arab-Mexicans are Christians who belong to the Maronite Church, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches.[168] A scant number are Muslims.\n\n\n\n#### Asian Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asian Mexicans\n\n![](image)Kavka Shishido drummer and vocalist.\nAlthough Asian Mexicans make up less than 1% of the total population of modern Mexico, they are nonetheless a notable minority. Due to the historical and contemporary perception in Mexican society of what constitutes Asian culture (associated with the Far East rather than the Near East), Asian Mexicans typically refers to those of East Asian descent, and may also include those of South and Southeast Asian descent. For Mexicans of West Asian descent, see the Middle Eastern Mexicans section.\n\n\nAsian immigration began with the arrival of Filipinos to Mexico during the Spanish period. For two and a half centuries, between 1565 and 1815, many Filipinos and Mexicans sailed to and from Mexico and the Philippines as sailors, crews, slaves, prisoners, adventurers and soldiers in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon assisting Spain in its trade between Asia and the Americas. Also on these voyages, thousands of Asian individuals (mostly males) were brought to Mexico as slaves and were called \"Chino\",[169] which means Chinese, although in reality they were of diverse origins, including Koreans, Japanese, Malays, Filipinos, Javanese, Cambodians, Timorese, and people from Bengal, India, Ceylon, Makassar, Tidore, Terenate, and China.[170][171][172] A notable example is the story of Catarina de San Juan (Mirra), an Indian girl captured by the Portuguese and sold into slavery in Manila. She arrived in New Spain and eventually she gave rise to the \"China Poblana\".\n\n\n\n![](image)Luis Nishizawa was a Mexican artist.\nThese early individuals are not very apparent in modern Mexico for two main reasons: the widespread *mestizaje* of Mexico during the Spanish period and the common practice of *Chino* slaves to \"pass\" as *Indios* (the indigenous people of Mexico) to attain freedom. As had occurred with a large portion of Mexico's black population, over generations the Asian populace was absorbed into the general Mestizo population. Facilitating this miscegenation was the assimilation of Asians into the indigenous population. The indigenous people were legally protected from chattel slavery, and by being recognized as part of this group, Asian slaves could claim they were wrongly enslaved.\n\n\nAsians, predominantly Chinese, became Mexico's fastest-growing immigrant group from the 1880s to the 1920s, exploding from about 1,500 in 1895 to more than 20,000 in 1910.[173]\n\n\n\n### Romani Mexicans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Romani Mexicans\n\nRomani people have settled in Mexico since the colonial era.[174] There are around 50,000 Vlax Romani in Mexico.[175]\n\n\n\n### Official censuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arcelia Ramírez Mexican actress\nHistorically, population studies and censuses have never been up to the standards that a population as diverse and numerous such as Mexico's require: the first racial census was made in 1793, being also Mexico's (then known as New Spain) first ever nationwide population census. Since only part of its original datasets survive, most of what is known of it comes from essays made by researchers who back in the day used the census' findings as reference for their own works. More than a century would pass until the Mexican government conducted a new racial census in 1921 (some sources assert that the census of 1895 included a comprehensive racial classification;[137] however, according to the historic archives of Mexico's National Institute of Statistics, that was not the case).[176] While the 1921 census was the last time the Mexican government conducted a census that included a comprehensive racial classification, in recent years it has conducted nationwide surveys to quantify most of the ethnic groups who inhabit the country as well as the social dynamics and inequalities between them.\n\n\n\n#### 1793 census[edit]\n\n\nAlso known as the \"Revillagigedo census\" from the name of the Count who ordered that it be conducted, this census was the first nationwide population census of Mexico (then known as the Viceroyalty of New Spain). Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, so most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works, such as Prussian geographer Alexander von Humboldt. Each author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country although they don't vary greatly, with Europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos from 21% to 25%, Indians from 51% to 61%, and Africans from 6,000 and 10,000. The estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded then, that across nearly three centuries of colonization, the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%–17% per century. The authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates, the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies in their suffering higher mortality rates due to living in remote locations rather than in cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or in being at war with them. For the same reasons, the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greatest variation range between publications, as in some cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted, leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others.[177]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Intendecy or territory\n | European population (%)\n | Indigenous population (%)\n | Mestizo population (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| México (only the State of Mexico and Mexico City)\n | 16.9%\n | 66.1%\n | 16.7%\n |\n| Puebla | 10.1%\n | 74.3%\n | 15.3%\n |\n| Oaxaca | 06.3%\n | 88.2%\n | 05.2%\n |\n| Guanajuato | 25.8%\n | 44.0%\n | 29.9%\n |\n| San Luis Potosí | 13.0%\n | 51.2%\n | 35.7%\n |\n| Zacatecas | 15.8%\n | 29.0%\n | 55.1%\n |\n| Durango | 20.2%\n | 36.0%\n | 43.5%\n |\n| Sonora | 28.5%\n | 44.9%\n | 26.4%\n |\n| Yucatán | 14.8%\n | 72.6%\n | 12.3%\n |\n| Guadalajara | 31.7%\n | 33.3%\n | 34.7%\n |\n| Veracruz | 10.4%\n | 74.0%\n | 15.2%\n |\n| Valladolid | 27.6%\n | 42.5%\n | 29.6%\n |\n| Nuevo México | ~\n | 30.8%\n | 69.0%\n |\n| Vieja California | ~\n | 51.7%\n | 47.9%\n |\n| Nueva California | ~\n | 89.9%\n | 09.8%\n |\n| Coahuila | 30.9%\n | 28.9%\n | 40.0%\n |\n| Nuevo León | 62.6%\n | 05.5%\n | 31.6%\n |\n| Nuevo Santander | 25.8%\n | 23.3%\n | 50.8%\n |\n| Texas | 39.7%\n | 27.3%\n | 32.4%\n |\n| Tlaxcala | 13.6%\n | 72.4%\n | 13.8%\n |\n\n\n~Europeans are included within the Mestizo category.\n\n\nRegardless of the possible inaccuracies related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside of the colonized areas, the effort that New Spain's authorities put into considering them as subjects is worth mentioning, as censuses made by other colonial or post-colonial countries did not consider American Indians to be citizens or subjects; for example, the censuses made by the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements.[178] Another example is the censuses made by the United States, which did not include Indigenous peoples living among the general population until 1860, and indigenous peoples as a whole until 1900.[179]\n\n\n\n#### 1921 census[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eulalio Gutiérrez (1881–1939), flanked by Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa (1878–1923) and Emiliano Zapata (1879–1919). Gutiérrez was appointed provisional President of Mexico by the Convention of Aguascalientes, a move that Venustiano Carranza (1859–1920) found intolerable. In the ensuing war, Obregón fought for Carranza against the convention.\nMade right after the consummation of the Mexican revolution, the social context in which this census was conducted makes it particularly unique, as the government of the time was in the process of rebuilding the country and was looking to unite all Mexicans in a single national identity. The 1921 census' final results in regards to race, which assert that 59.3% of the Mexican population self-identified as Mestizo, 29.1% as Indigenous, and only 9.8% as White, were then essential in cementing the *mestizaje* ideology (which asserts that the Mexican population as a whole is product of the admixture of all races), which shaped Mexican identity and culture through the 20th century and remains prominent nowadays, with extraofficial international publications such as *The World Factbook* and *Encyclopædia Britannica* using the 1921 census as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition up to this day.[93][113]\n\n\nNonetheless, in recent times, the census' results have been subjected to scrutiny by historians, academics and social activists alike, who assert that such drastic alterations on demographic trends with respect to the 1793 census are impossible and cite, among other statistics, the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico.[180] It is claimed that the *mestizaje* process sponsored by the state was more \"cultural than biological\", which resulted in the numbers of the Mestizo Mexican group being inflated at the expense of the identity of other races.[181] Controversies aside, this census constituted the last time the Mexican Government conducted a comprehensive racial census with the breakdown by states being the following (foreigners and people who answered \"other\" not included):[182]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Federative Units\n | Mestizo Population (%)\n | Amerindian Population (%)\n | White Population (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aguascalientes | 66.12%\n | 16.70%\n | 16.77%\n |\n| Baja California(Distrito Norte) | 72.50%\n | 07.72%\n | 00.35%\n |\n| Baja California(Distrito Sur) | 59.61%\n | 06.06%\n | 33.40%\n |\n| Campeche | 41.45%\n | 43.41%\n | 14.17%\n |\n| Coahuila | 77.88%\n | 11.38%\n | 10.13%\n |\n| Colima | 68.54%\n | 26.00%\n | 04.50%\n |\n| Chiapas | 36.27%\n | 47.64%\n | 11.82%\n |\n| Chihuahua | 50.09%\n | 12.76%\n | 36.33%\n |\n| Durango | 89.85%\n | 09.99%\n | 00.01%\n |\n| Guanajuato | 96.33%\n | 02.96%\n | 00.54%\n |\n| Guerrero | 54.05%\n | 43.84%\n | 02.07%\n |\n| Hidalgo | 51.47%\n | 39.49%\n | 08.83%\n |\n| Jalisco | 75.83%\n | 16.76%\n | 07.31%\n |\n| Mexico City | 54.78%\n | 18.75%\n | 22.79%\n |\n| State of Mexico | 47.71%\n | 42.13%\n | 10.02%\n |\n| Michoacán | 70.95%\n | 21.04%\n | 06.94%\n |\n| Morelos | 61.24%\n | 34.93%\n | 03.59%\n |\n| Nayarit | 73.45%\n | 20.38%\n | 05.83%\n |\n| Nuevo León | 75.47%\n | 05.14%\n | 19.23%\n |\n| Oaxaca | 28.15%\n | 69.17%\n | 01.43%\n |\n| Puebla | 39.34%\n | 54.73%\n | 05.66%\n |\n| Querétaro | 80.15%\n | 19.40%\n | 00.30%\n |\n| Quintana Roo | 42.35%\n | 20.59%\n | 15.16%\n |\n| San Luis Potosí | 61.88%\n | 30.60%\n | 05.41%\n |\n| Sinaloa | 98.30%\n | 00.93%\n | 00.19%\n |\n| Sonora | 41.04%\n | 14.00%\n | 42.54%\n |\n| Tabasco | 53.67%\n | 18.50%\n | 27.56%\n |\n| Tamaulipas | 69.77%\n | 13.89%\n | 13.62%\n |\n| Tlaxcala | 42.44%\n | 54.70%\n | 02.53%\n |\n| Veracruz | 50.09%\n | 36.60%\n | 10.28%\n |\n| Yucatán | 33.83%\n | 43.31%\n | 21.85%\n |\n| Zacatecas | 86.10%\n | 08.54%\n | 05.26%\n |\n\n\nWhen the 1921 census' results are compared with the results of Mexico's recent censuses[130] as well as with modern genetic research,[183] there is high consistency with respect to the distribution of Indigenous Mexicans across the country, with states located in south and south-eastern Mexico having both the highest percentages of population who self-identify as Indigenous and the highest percentages of Amerindian genetic ancestry. However, this is not the case when it comes to European Mexicans, as there are instances in which states that have been shown through scientific research to have a considerably high European ancestry are reported to have very small white populations in the 1921 census, with the most extreme case being that of the state of Durango, where the aforementioned census asserts that only 0.01% of the state's population (33 persons) self-identified as \"white\" while modern scientific research shows that the population of Durango has similar genetic frequencies to those found on European peoples (with the state's Indigenous population showing almost no foreign admixture either).[184] Various authors theorize that the reason for these inconsistencies may lie in the Mestizo identity promoted by the Mexican government, which reportedly led to people who are not biologically Mestizos to identify themselves as such.[107][185]\n\n\n\n#### The present day[edit]\n\n\nThe following table is a compilation of, when possible, official nationwide surveys conducted by the Mexican government which have attempted to quantify different Mexican ethnic groups. Given that, for the most part, each ethnic group was estimated by different surveys with different methodologies and years apart rather than on a single comprehensive racial census, some groups could overlap with others and be overestimated or underestimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Race or ethnicity\n | Population (est.)\n | Percentage (est.)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Indigenous | 26,000,000\n | 21.5%\n | 2015[130] |\n| Black | 2,576,213\n | 2.4%\n | 2020[186] |\n| White | 56,000,000\n | 47.0%\n | 2010[145][146][147] |\n| Foreigners residing in Mexico (of any race)\n | 1,010,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2015[187] |\n| East Asian | 1,000,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2010[188] |\n| Middle Eastern | 400,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2010[189] |\n| Jewish | 68,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2010[190] |\n| Muslim | 4,000\n | <1.0%\n | 2015[191] |\n| Unclassified (most likely Mestizos)\n | 37,300,000\n | 30.0%\n | –\n |\n| Total\n | 123,500,000\n | 100%\n | 2017[192] |\n\n\nOf all the ethnic groups that have been surveyed, Mestizos are notably absent, which is likely due to the label's fluid and subjective definition, which complicates its precise quantification. However it can be safely assumed that Mestizos make up at least the remaining 30% unassessed percentage of Mexico's population with possibilities of increasing if the methodologies of the extant surveys are considered. For example, the 2015 intercensal survey considered individuals who self-identified as \"part Indigenous\" or \"part African\" as part of a combined group of Indigenous Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans altogether. Such people technically would be Mestizos. Similarly, White Mexicans were quantified based on physical traits and appearance. Thus, technically a Mestizo with a percentage of Indigenous ancestry that was low enough to not affect his or her primarily European phenotype was considered to be white. Finally, the remaining ethnicities, relatively low in number, have more permissive classification criteria. Some of these ethnicities are faiths. Therefore, a Mestizo could claim to belong to one of them by practicing the faith, or by having an ancestor who belonged to at least one of these ethnicities.\nNonetheless, contemporary sociologists and historians agree that, given that the concept of \"race\" has a psychological foundation rather than a biological one, and that to society's eyes, a Mestizo with a high percentage of European ancestry is considered \"white\", and a Mestizo with a high percentage of Indigenous ancestry is considered \"Indian\", a person who identifies with a given ethnic group should be allowed to, even if biologically he or she doesn't completely belong to that group.[193]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Mexico\n\nLanguages in Mexico (by percentage):[194]\n\n\n\nSpanish (92.7%)\nSpanish and indigenous languages (5.7%)\nindigenous (0.8%)\nunspecified (0.8%)\n\nSpanish is the *de facto* official language in Mexico being spoken by 98.3% of the population.[195] Mexican Spanish is spoken in a variety of dialects, accents and variations in different regions across the country.\n\n\nSome indigenous languages are still being spoken by around 5% of Mexicans according to the latest census, in 2003 the General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples recognized 68 indigenous languages as \"national languages\", with the \"same validity\" in all territories and contexts where they are spoken. The indigenous language with the greatest number of speakers is Nahuatl (1,586,884 speakers in 2010 or 1.5% of the nation's population), followed by Yucatec Maya (796,405 speakers in 2010 0.8%) spoken Yucatán Peninsula, Mixtecas languages (494,454), Tzeltal (474,298), Zapotecas languages (460,683), Tzotzil (429,168), Otomí (288,052), Totonaca (250,252) Mazateco (230,124), Chol (222,051) and 1,462,857 speakers of other languages. After half a century of rural-to-urban migration, in Mexico City and other major cities large districts and sections use both written and spoken Amerindian languages.\n\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century the government promoted a policy of *castellanización*, that is, promoting the use of Spanish as a way to integrate indigenous peoples into Mexican society. Later, this policy changed, and since the 1980s the government has sponsored bilingual and intercultural education in all indigenous communities. This policy has mainly been successful in large communities with a significant number of speakers. While some languages, with less than 1,000 speakers, are still facing extinction.\n\n\nThe second most spoken language in Mexico, however, is English. It is used extensively at border areas, tourist centers and large metropolitan areas, a phenomenon arguably caused by the economic integration of North American under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the immigration phenomenon and the return of workers and their families from the United States.[196] In border cities, American TV and radio waves in English (and Spanish) are received as much Spanish-speaking radio and TV stations from Mexico on the US side of the border, thus a bilingual cross-cultural exchange is at work.\n\n\nAmong the languages brought to the country by immigrants are the Venetian of Chipilo, and Mennonite Low German spoken in Durango and Chihuahua.\n\n\n\n## Mexican nationality and citizenship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexican passport\nMain article: Mexican nationality law\n\nThe Constitution of Mexico grants Mexican nationality based on birth and naturalization. Mexican laws regarding nationality by birth are very open. Mexican nationality by birth is granted to:[197]\n\n\n\n* all those individuals born in Mexican territory,\n* all those individuals born outside Mexico, whose father or mother is Mexican by birth,\n* all those individuals born outside Mexico, whose father or mother is Mexican by naturalization,\n* all those individuals born aboard Mexican aircraft or sea vessels, whether warships or commercial vessels.\n\n\nMexican nationality by naturalization is granted to:[197]\n\n\n\n* foreign citizens granted Mexican nationality by the Secretariat of Government (Ministry of the Interior);\n* foreign citizens married to a Mexican national, whether by birth or naturalization.\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Mexico\n\nReligion in Mexico (by percentage):[194]\n\n\n\nRoman Catholic (82.7%)\nEvangelical Churches (5%)\nPentecostal (1.6%)\nJehovah's Witnesses (1.4%)\nother (1.9%)\nnone (4.7%)\nunspecified (2.7%)\n\nThe Mexican population is predominantly Catholic (78% of the population aged five and older, according to the 2020 census),[198] although the percentage representing those who attend church on a weekly basis is lower (46%).[199] About 7.6% of the population was classified as Protestant or Evangelical, 2.5% were classified as \"Non-Evangelical Biblical\" (a classification that groups Adventists, Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses), 0.05% as practicing Jews, and 4.6% without a religion.[200] The largest group of Protestants are Pentecostals and Charismatics (classified as Neo-Pentecostals).\n\n\n\n![](image)Church of Archangel Michael — from the town of Comala, in the state of Colima.\nThe states with the highest percentage of professing Catholics are central states, namely Guanajuato (96.4%), Aguascalientes (95.6%) and Jalisco (95.4%), whereas southeastern states have the lowest percentage of Catholics, namely Chiapas (63.8%), Tabasco (70.4%) and Campeche (71.3%).[200] The percentage of professing Catholics has been on the decrease over the last four decades, from over 98% in 1950 to 78% in 2020.[198] The average annual growth of Catholic believers from 1990 to 2000 was 1.7% whereas that of non-Catholics was 3.7%.[201] Given that the average annual population increase over the same time period was 1.8%,[202] the percentage of Catholics in relation to the total population continues to be in overall decline.\n\n\nSince 1857 with the La Reforma laws, the Mexican Constitution drastically separates Church and State, unlike some other countries in Latin America or Ibero-America. The State does not support or provide any economic resource to the Church (as is the case in Spain and Argentina),[203] and the Church cannot participate in public education (no public school can be operated by a Catholic order, although they can participate in private education). Moreover, the government nationalized all the Church's properties (some of which were given back in the 1990s), and priests lost the right to vote or to be voted for (although in the 1990s they regained the right to vote).\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of municipalities in Mexico by population\n* Metropolitan areas of Mexico\n* List of Mexican states by population\n* List of Mexican states by fertility rate\n* Economy of Mexico\n* Poverty in Mexico\n* Romani Mexicans\n\n\n## References and notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"People and Society\". *cia.gov*.

These people are called Ladino in Guatemala. The population is divided almost evenly between rural and urban areas.[2]\n\n\nAbout 65% of the population speak Spanish, with nearly all the rest speaking indigenous languages (there are 23 officially recognized indigenous languages).[3]\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation census| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  1778  | 396,149 | —     |\n|  1880  | 1,224,602 | +209.1% |\n|  1893  | 1,364,678 | +11.4% |\n|  1921  | 2,004,900 | +46.9% |\n|  1940  | 2,400,000 | +19.7% |\n|  1950  | 2,790,868 | +16.3% |\n|  1964  | 4,287,997 | +53.6% |\n|  1973  | 5,160,221 | +20.3% |\n|  1981  | 6,054,227 | +17.3% |\n|  1994  | 8,331,874 | +37.6% |\n|  2002  | 11,237,196 | +34.9% |\n|  2018  | 14,901,286 | +32.6% |\n| Source: [4][5] |\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The proportion of the population below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.5%, 54.1% were aged between 15 and 65 years of age, and 4.4% were aged 65 years or older.[8]\n\n\nGuatemala City is home to almost 3 million inhabitants.[9] In 1900 Guatemala had a population of 1,885,000.[10] \nOver the twentifirst century Guatemala's population grew by a factor of fourteen. Even though Guatemala's population grew by a factor of 14, it still wasn't the biggest jump in that region.[11] Although Guatemala does have an increase in population, the annual population isn't the superior in that region of the world as well.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Total population (x 1000)\n | Proportionaged 0–14(%)\n | Proportionaged 15–64(%)\n | Proportionaged 65+(%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950\n | 3 146 | 44.6 | 52.9 | 2.5\n |\n| 1955\n | 3 619 | 45.4 | 52.0 | 2.6\n |\n| 1960\n | 4 141 | 45.8 | 51.6 | 2.7\n |\n| 1965\n | 4 736 | 45.2 | 52.0 | 2.8\n |\n| 1970\n | 5 416 | 44.6 | 52.5 | 2.9\n |\n| 1975\n | 6 194 | 44.8 | 52.3 | 2.9\n |\n| 1980\n | 7 001 | 45.4 | 51.6 | 3.0\n |\n| 1985\n | 7 920 | 45.7 | 51.2 | 3.1\n |\n| 1990\n | 8 890 | 45.4 | 51.3 | 3.4\n |\n| 1995\n | 9 984 | 44.9 | 51.4 | 3.7\n |\n| 2000\n | 11 651 | 43.7 | 52.3 | 4.0\n |\n| 2005\n | 13 096 | 42.3 | 53.6 | 4.2\n |\n| 2010\n | 14 630 | 39.4 | 56.3 | 4.3\n |\n| 2015\n | 16 252 | 36.2 | 59.3 | 4.5\n |\n| 2020\n | 17 916 | 33.3 | 61.6 | 5.0\n |\n\n\n### Population by departments[edit]\n\n\nIn Guatemala, there are 22 departments that make up the country.

Sololá accounts for 2.7% of the population while ranking in the middle at 11. Overall, the rankings correlate to the percent of the population that each department contains.\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nThe Guatemalan civil war from 1960 to 1996 led to mass emigration, particularly Guatemalan immigration to the United States. According to the International Organization for Migration, the total number of emigrants increased from 6,700 in the 1960s to 558,776 for the period 1995–2000; by 2005, the total number had reached 1.3 million.[14] In 2013, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimated that there were about 900,000 Guatemalan Americans (persons of Guatemalan origin in the United States).[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Count\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image) United States | 480,665[16] – 1,489,426[17] |\n| ![Mexico](image) Mexico | 23,529[17] |\n| ![Belize](image) Belize | 14,693[17] |\n| ![Canada](image) Canada | 14,256[17] – 34,665[18] |\n| ![Germany](image) Germany | 5,989[17] |\n| ![Honduras](image) Honduras | 5,172[17] |\n| ![El Salvador](image) El Salvador | 4,209[17] |\n| ![Spain](image) Spain | 2,491[17] |\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Indigenous girls in Chichicastenango\nOfficial 2018 statistics indicate that approximately 56% of the population is \"non-Indigenous\",[1] referring to the Mestizo population of mixed indigenous and European origins (50-52%) and the people of European origin (14-26%), Most are of Spanish, German and Italian descent. These people are called Ladino in Guatemala. Genetic testing indicates that Guatemalan Mestizos are of predominantly indigenous ancestry, although they have a high level of European ancestry as well.[19]\n\n\nApproximately 43.4% of the population is Indigenous[2] and consist of 23 Maya groups and one non-Maya group. In 2012 these are divided as follows: K'iche 9.1%, 8.4% Kaqchikel, Mam 7.9%, 6.3% Q'eqchi', other Maya peoples 8.6%, 0.2% Indigenous non-Maya.[3] They live all over the country, especially in the highlands. While the official censuses usually count around 40% of the Guatemalan population being indigenous, this percentage is actually much higher, with around 60% of Guatemalans being indigenous.[20]\n\n\nIn 2002 Census, The Amerindian populations in Guatemala include the K'iche' 9.1%, Kaqchikel 8.4%, Mam 7.9% and Q'eqchi 6.3%. 8.6% belongs to other Maya groups, 0.4% belong to non-Maya Indigenous peoples. The whole Indigenous community in Guatemala is about 40.5% of the population.\n\n\nThe Maya Civilization ruled Guatemala and the surrounding regions until around 1521 A.D. Following 1521 A.D., Guatemala became a Spanish colony for approximately three centuries, until in 1821 when Guatemala won its independence. Since the independence of Guatemala, the country has experienced a wide range of governments, including civilian and military governments. In 1996, a peace treaty was signed by the government that ended internal conflicts within the region, which caused over 200,000 casualties and approximately one million refugees.[21]\n\n\nThe ethnic population in the Kingdom of Guatemala, at the time of Independence, amounted to nearly 600,000 Indians, 300,000 Castas (mostly Mestizos and a lesser number of Mulattos, Zambos, and Pardos), and 45,000 Criollos or Spaniards, with a very small number of English traders.[22]\n\n\nOther racial groups include numbers of Afro-Guatemalans, Afro-Mestizos, and Garifuna of mixed African and Indigenous Caribbean origins who live in the country's eastern end. Some Garifunas live mainly in Livingston, San Vicente and Puerto Barrios. They descend mainly from the Arawaks and Belizean Creoles.[3]\n\n\nThere are also thousands of Jews residing in Guatemala. They are immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe that arrived in the 19th century. Many immigrated during World War II. There are approximately 9,000 Jews living in Guatemala today. Most live in Guatemala City, Quezaltenango and San Marcos. Today, the Jewish community in Guatemala is made up of Orthodox Jews, Sephardi, Eastern European and German Jews.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2014, numerous members of the Hasidic communities Lev Tahor and Toiras Jesed began settling in the village of San Juan La Laguna. The mainstream Jewish community was reportedly dismayed and concerned that the arrival of communities with a more visible adherence to Judaism might stir up anti-Jewish sentiment. Despite the tropical heat, the members of the community continued to wear traditional Jewish clothing.[23][24]\n\n\nGuatemala has a community of East Asian descent, largely of Chinese and Korean origin.[25] There are thousands of Arab Guatemalans descending from West Asian countries like Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Iraq. Some belong to Christian Churches while others to Islamic Mosques.\n\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\nThe Population Department of the United Nations prepared the

This phenomenon, known as child marriage, is prevalent in Central America; in rural areas of Guatemala, 53% of 20 to 24-year-old women married before their 18th birthday. Once married, young girls are likely to abandon their education and are exposed to domestic and sexual violence. They are no longer seen as girls; their husbands, who are often older men, see them as servants. Frequently births are at home. Most of these women are isolated without networks of support.[33]\n\n\nIn most cases, motherhood comes after marriage. However, due to the fact that these young women' bodies are not entirely developed, many pregnancies result in high complications and high risks for both the mother and baby, during and after labor.[33] Because there is limited access to health services, women in Guatemala choose a different alternative when it comes to the care during and after child delivery. Pregnancies before marriage are on the rise and unmarried women make their decision based on their image more than their safety.[34] Single Guatemalan women may choose midwives as their health care provider during pregnancy and delivery to avoid feeling ashamed.[34] Other women know the midwives in the community personally so they opt for a private healthcare provider.[34] Throughout the country, midwives are known as the providers of choice for approximately 80% of the births even though they are not professionally trained.[34] This contributes to the increasing infant mortality rate of 100 per 1,000 births as reported in some Guatemalan communities.[34]\n\n\n\n## Other demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2022.[35]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minutes\n* One death every 6 minutes\n* One net migrant every 58 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 2 minutes\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[36]\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n17,703,190 (2022 est.)\n16,581,273 (July 2018 est.)\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMestizo (mixed Amerindian-Spanish - in local Spanish called Ladino) 56%, Maya 41.7%, Xinca (Indigenous, non-Maya) 1.8%, African descent 0.2%, Garifuna (mixed West and Central African, Island Carib, and Arawak) 0.1%, foreign 0.2% (2018 est.)\n\n\n\n### Age structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of Guatemala in 2020\n*0-14 years:* 33.68% (male 2,944,145/female 2,833,432)\n*15-24 years:* 19.76% (male 1,705,730/female 1,683,546)\n*25-54 years:* 36.45% (male 3,065,933/female 3,186,816)\n*55-64 years:* 5.41% (male 431,417/female 496,743)\n*65 years and over:* 4.7% (male 363,460/female 442,066) (2020 est.)\n*0-14 years:* 34.55% (male 2,919,281 /female 2,810,329)\n*15-24 years:* 20.23% (male 1,688,900 /female 1,665,631)\n*25-54 years:* 35.47% (male 2,878,075 /female 3,002,920)\n*55-64 years:* 5.28% (male 407,592 /female 468,335)\n*65 years and over:* 4.46% (male 336,377 /female 403,833) (2018 est.)\n### Birth rate[edit]\n\n\n22.34 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)

It is spoken by nearly 93% of the population and is found mainly in the departments of the Southern region, Eastern region, Guatemala City and Peten.[37] Though the official language is Spanish, it is often the second language among the Indigenous population.\n\n\nApproximately 23 additional Amerindian languages are spoken by more than 40% of the population.[38] 21 Mayan languages, one indigenous, and one Arawakan are spoken in Guatemala.[39] The most significant are; Quiche, Cakchiquel, Kekchi, Mam, Garifuna and Xinca.[38]\n\n\nThere are also significant numbers of German, Chinese, French and English speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rank\n | Language\n | Language family\n |\n| 1\n | Spanish\n | Indo-European\n |\n| 2\n | K’iche’\n | Mayan\n |\n| 3\n | Q'eqchi'\n | Mayan\n |\n| 4\n | Kaqchikel\n | Mayan\n |\n| 5\n | Mam\n | Mayan\n |\n| 6\n | Poqomchi\n | Mayan\n |\n| 7\n | Tz’utujil\n | Mayan\n |\n| 8\n | Achí\n | Mayan\n |\n| 9\n | Q’anjob’al\n | Mayan\n |\n| 10\n | Ixil\n | Mayan\n |\n| 11\n | Akatek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 12\n | Jakaltek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 13\n | Chuj\n | Mayan\n |\n| 14\n | Poqomam\n | Mayan\n |\n| 15\n | Ch'orti'\n | Mayan\n |\n| 16\n | Awakatek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 17\n | Sakapultek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 18\n | Sipakapa\n | Mayan\n |\n| 19\n | Garífuna\n | Arawakan\n |\n| 20\n | Uspantek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 21\n | Tektitek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 22\n | Mopan\n | Mayan\n |\n| 23\n | Xincan languages\n | Isolate\n |\n| 24\n | Itza\n | Mayan\n |\n\n\n[39]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Guatemala\n\nCatholicism was the official religion during the colonial era, and today is the most professed church in the population, but since the 1960s, with the Armed Conflict, Protestantism has increased progressively, today around two fifths of Guatemalans are Protestant, specially Evangelicals (with Pentecostals as the biggest branch).[40] Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy claim rapid growth, especially among the Indigenous Maya. Other churches include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Christian minorities. More than 60% of Catholics and 80% of Protestants are actives members,[40] today Catholicism and Protestantism are more unity to obtain the Politic control against globalization influence such as the acceptance of Homosexuality, abortion and other Human rights. Although Christianity is largely influential in public complex, since 1990 decade there are notable presence of non-religious people in surveys of religious identification.\n\n\nIndigenous beliefs are sometimes combined with Christianity.[40] Maya religion believers only account for less than 0.1% of the population and since the mid-1990s the Constitution recognizes the rights of Maya Religion. The Islamic community in Guatemala is growing, and is projected to include at least 2,000 believers by 2030.[41] There is a mosque in Guatemala City called the Islamic Da'wah Mosque of Guatemala (Spanish: Mezquita de Aldawaa Islámica). The president of the Islamic Community of the country is Jamal Mubarak.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Religious evolution in Guatemala[40] |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | % Catholic\n | % Protestants\n | % Others\n | % No religion\n | Source\n |\n| 1980\n | 78%\n | 13.1%\n | 4.9%\n | 4.0%\n | National Christian-Survey, June 1980\n |\n| 1990\n | 67.5%\n | 20.9%\n | 2.0%\n | 9.6%\n | CID-Gallup, September 1990\n |\n| 2001\n | 55%\n | 29.9%\n | 2.4%\n | 12.7%\n | CID-Gallup, November 2001\n |\n| 2012\n | 47.9%\n | 38.2%\n | 2.3%\n | 11.6%\n | CID-Gallup, September 2012\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Resultados Del Censo 2018\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Caracterización estadística República de Guatemala 2012\" (PDF).

Even though Guatemala's population grew by a factor of 14, it still wasn't the biggest jump in that region.[11] Although Guatemala does have an increase in population, the annual population isn't the superior in that region of the world as well.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Total population (x 1000)\n | Proportionaged 0–14(%)\n | Proportionaged 15–64(%)\n | Proportionaged 65+(%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950\n | 3 146 | 44.6 | 52.9 | 2.5\n |\n| 1955\n | 3 619 | 45.4 | 52.0 | 2.6\n |\n| 1960\n | 4 141 | 45.8 | 51.6 | 2.7\n |\n| 1965\n | 4 736 | 45.2 | 52.0 | 2.8\n |\n| 1970\n | 5 416 | 44.6 | 52.5 | 2.9\n |\n| 1975\n | 6 194 | 44.8 | 52.3 | 2.9\n |\n| 1980\n | 7 001 | 45.4 | 51.6 | 3.0\n |\n| 1985\n | 7 920 | 45.7 | 51.2 | 3.1\n |\n| 1990\n | 8 890 | 45.4 | 51.3 | 3.4\n |\n| 1995\n | 9 984 | 44.9 | 51.4 | 3.7\n |\n| 2000\n | 11 651 | 43.7 | 52.3 | 4.0\n |\n| 2005\n | 13 096 | 42.3 | 53.6 | 4.2\n |\n| 2010\n | 14 630 | 39.4 | 56.3 | 4.3\n |\n| 2015\n | 16 252 | 36.2 | 59.3 | 4.5\n |\n| 2020\n | 17 916 | 33.3 | 61.6 | 5.0\n |\n\n\n### Population by departments[edit]\n\n\nIn Guatemala, there are 22 departments that make up the country. Each department has its own population, with Guatemala Department ranking at 1 with the highest population and El Progreso Department ranking at 22 with the lowest population.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Rank** | **Department** | **Pop.** | **Rank** | **Department** | **Pop.** |\n| 1\n | Guatemala Department | 3,306,397\n | 12\n | Jutiapa | 489,085\n |\n| 2\n | Huehuetenango | 1,234,593\n | 13\n | Izabal | 445,125\n |\n| 3\n | Alta Verapaz | 1,219,585\n | 14\n | Chiquimula | 397,202\n |\n| 4\n | San Marcos | 1,095,997\n | 15\n | Santa Rosa | 367,569\n |\n| 5\n | Quiché | 955,705\n | 16\n | Jalapa | 345,926\n |\n| 6\n | Quetzaltenango | 844,906\n | 17\n | Sacatepéquez | 336,606\n |\n| 7\n | Escuintla | 746,309\n | 18\n | Retalhuleu | 325,556\n |\n| 8\n | Petén | 711,585\n | 19\n | Baja Verapaz | 291,903\n |\n| 9\n | Chimaltenango | 666,938\n | 20\n | Zacapa | 291,903\n |\n| 10\n | Suchitepéquez | 555,261\n | 21\n | Totonicapán | 134,373\n |\n| 11\n | Sololá | 430,573\n | 22\n | El Progreso | 22,654\n |\n| **Overall Total: 15,806,675 (2014)** |\n| **Source: National Institute of Statistics (INE)**[13] |\n\n\nAccording to the table, Guatemala Department accounts for 20% of the entire population in Guatemala, while El Progreso only accounts for 0.14% of the population. Sololá accounts for 2.7% of the population while ranking in the middle at 11. Overall, the rankings correlate to the percent of the population that each department contains.\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nThe Guatemalan civil war from 1960 to 1996 led to mass emigration, particularly Guatemalan immigration to the United States. According to the International Organization for Migration, the total number of emigrants increased from 6,700 in the 1960s to 558,776 for the period 1995–2000; by 2005, the total number had reached 1.3 million.[14] In 2013, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimated that there were about 900,000 Guatemalan Americans (persons of Guatemalan origin in the United States).[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Count\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image) United States | 480,665[16] – 1,489,426[17] |\n| ![Mexico](image) Mexico | 23,529[17] |\n| ![Belize](image) Belize | 14,693[17] |\n| ![Canada](image) Canada | 14,256[17] – 34,665[18] |\n| ![Germany](image) Germany | 5,989[17] |\n| ![Honduras](image) Honduras | 5,172[17] |\n| ![El Salvador](image) El Salvador | 4,209[17] |\n| ![Spain](image) Spain | 2,491[17] |\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Indigenous girls in Chichicastenango\nOfficial 2018 statistics indicate that approximately 56% of the population is \"non-Indigenous\",[1] referring to the Mestizo population of mixed indigenous and European origins (50-52%) and the people of European origin (14-26%), Most are of Spanish, German and Italian descent. These people are called Ladino in Guatemala. Genetic testing indicates that Guatemalan Mestizos are of predominantly indigenous ancestry, although they have a high level of European ancestry as well.[19]\n\n\nApproximately 43.4% of the population is Indigenous[2] and consist of 23 Maya groups and one non-Maya group. In 2012 these are divided as follows: K'iche 9.1%, 8.4% Kaqchikel, Mam 7.9%, 6.3% Q'eqchi', other Maya peoples 8.6%, 0.2% Indigenous non-Maya.[3] They live all over the country, especially in the highlands. While the official censuses usually count around 40% of the Guatemalan population being indigenous, this percentage is actually much higher, with around 60% of Guatemalans being indigenous.[20]\n\n\nIn 2002 Census, The Amerindian populations in Guatemala include the K'iche' 9.1%, Kaqchikel 8.4%, Mam 7.9% and Q'eqchi 6.3%. 8.6% belongs to other Maya groups, 0.4% belong to non-Maya Indigenous peoples. The whole Indigenous community in Guatemala is about 40.5% of the population.\n\n\nThe Maya Civilization ruled Guatemala and the surrounding regions until around 1521 A.D. Following 1521 A.D., Guatemala became a Spanish colony for approximately three centuries, until in 1821 when Guatemala won its independence. Since the independence of Guatemala, the country has experienced a wide range of governments, including civilian and military governments. In 1996, a peace treaty was signed by the government that ended internal conflicts within the region, which caused over 200,000 casualties and approximately one million refugees.[21]\n\n\nThe ethnic population in the Kingdom of Guatemala, at the time of Independence, amounted to nearly 600,000 Indians, 300,000 Castas (mostly Mestizos and a lesser number of Mulattos, Zambos, and Pardos), and 45,000 Criollos or Spaniards, with a very small number of English traders.[22]\n\n\nOther racial groups include numbers of Afro-Guatemalans, Afro-Mestizos, and Garifuna of mixed African and Indigenous Caribbean origins who live in the country's eastern end. Some Garifunas live mainly in Livingston, San Vicente and Puerto Barrios. They descend mainly from the Arawaks and Belizean Creoles.[3]\n\n\nThere are also thousands of Jews residing in Guatemala. They are immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe that arrived in the 19th century. Many immigrated during World War II. There are approximately 9,000 Jews living in Guatemala today. Most live in Guatemala City, Quezaltenango and San Marcos. Today, the Jewish community in Guatemala is made up of Orthodox Jews, Sephardi, Eastern European and German Jews.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2014, numerous members of the Hasidic communities Lev Tahor and Toiras Jesed began settling in the village of San Juan La Laguna. The mainstream Jewish community was reportedly dismayed and concerned that the arrival of communities with a more visible adherence to Judaism might stir up anti-Jewish sentiment. Despite the tropical heat, the members of the community continued to wear traditional Jewish clothing.[23][24]\n\n\nGuatemala has a community of East Asian descent, largely of Chinese and Korean origin.[25] There are thousands of Arab Guatemalans descending from West Asian countries like Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Iraq. Some belong to Christian Churches while others to Islamic Mosques.\n\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\nThe Population Department of the United Nations prepared the

This phenomenon, known as child marriage, is prevalent in Central America; in rural areas of Guatemala, 53% of 20 to 24-year-old women married before their 18th birthday. Once married, young girls are likely to abandon their education and are exposed to domestic and sexual violence. They are no longer seen as girls; their husbands, who are often older men, see them as servants. Frequently births are at home. Most of these women are isolated without networks of support.[33]\n\n\nIn most cases, motherhood comes after marriage. However, due to the fact that these young women' bodies are not entirely developed, many pregnancies result in high complications and high risks for both the mother and baby, during and after labor.[33] Because there is limited access to health services, women in Guatemala choose a different alternative when it comes to the care during and after child delivery. Pregnancies before marriage are on the rise and unmarried women make their decision based on their image more than their safety.[34] Single Guatemalan women may choose midwives as their health care provider during pregnancy and delivery to avoid feeling ashamed.[34] Other women know the midwives in the community personally so they opt for a private healthcare provider.[34] Throughout the country, midwives are known as the providers of choice for approximately 80% of the births even though they are not professionally trained.[34] This contributes to the increasing infant mortality rate of 100 per 1,000 births as reported in some Guatemalan communities.[34]\n\n\n\n## Other demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2022.[35]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minutes\n* One death every 6 minutes\n* One net migrant every 58 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 2 minutes\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[36]\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n17,703,190 (2022 est.)\n16,581,273 (July 2018 est.)\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMestizo (mixed Amerindian-Spanish - in local Spanish called Ladino) 56%, Maya 41.7%, Xinca (Indigenous, non-Maya) 1.8%, African descent 0.2%, Garifuna (mixed West and Central African, Island Carib, and Arawak) 0.1%, foreign 0.2% (2018 est.)\n\n\n\n### Age structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of Guatemala in 2020\n*0-14 years:* 33.68% (male 2,944,145/female 2,833,432)\n*15-24 years:* 19.76% (male 1,705,730/female 1,683,546)\n*25-54 years:* 36.45% (male 3,065,933/female 3,186,816)\n*55-64 years:* 5.41% (male 431,417/female 496,743)\n*65 years and over:* 4.7% (male 363,460/female 442,066) (2020 est.)\n*0-14 years:* 34.55% (male 2,919,281 /female 2,810,329)\n*15-24 years:* 20.23% (male 1,688,900 /female 1,665,631)\n*25-54 years:* 35.47% (male 2,878,075 /female 3,002,920)\n*55-64 years:* 5.28% (male 407,592 /female 468,335)\n*65 years and over:* 4.46% (male 336,377 /female 403,833) (2018 est.)\n### Birth rate[edit]\n\n\n22.34 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)

It is spoken by nearly 93% of the population and is found mainly in the departments of the Southern region, Eastern region, Guatemala City and Peten.[37] Though the official language is Spanish, it is often the second language among the Indigenous population.\n\n\nApproximately 23 additional Amerindian languages are spoken by more than 40% of the population.[38] 21 Mayan languages, one indigenous, and one Arawakan are spoken in Guatemala.[39] The most significant are; Quiche, Cakchiquel, Kekchi, Mam, Garifuna and Xinca.[38]\n\n\nThere are also significant numbers of German, Chinese, French and English speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rank\n | Language\n | Language family\n |\n| 1\n | Spanish\n | Indo-European\n |\n| 2\n | K’iche’\n | Mayan\n |\n| 3\n | Q'eqchi'\n | Mayan\n |\n| 4\n | Kaqchikel\n | Mayan\n |\n| 5\n | Mam\n | Mayan\n |\n| 6\n | Poqomchi\n | Mayan\n |\n| 7\n | Tz’utujil\n | Mayan\n |\n| 8\n | Achí\n | Mayan\n |\n| 9\n | Q’anjob’al\n | Mayan\n |\n| 10\n | Ixil\n | Mayan\n |\n| 11\n | Akatek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 12\n | Jakaltek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 13\n | Chuj\n | Mayan\n |\n| 14\n | Poqomam\n | Mayan\n |\n| 15\n | Ch'orti'\n | Mayan\n |\n| 16\n | Awakatek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 17\n | Sakapultek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 18\n | Sipakapa\n | Mayan\n |\n| 19\n | Garífuna\n | Arawakan\n |\n| 20\n | Uspantek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 21\n | Tektitek\n | Mayan\n |\n| 22\n | Mopan\n | Mayan\n |\n| 23\n | Xincan languages\n | Isolate\n |\n| 24\n | Itza\n | Mayan\n |\n\n\n[39]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Guatemala\n\nCatholicism was the official religion during the colonial era, and today is the most professed church in the population, but since the 1960s, with the Armed Conflict, Protestantism has increased progressively, today around two fifths of Guatemalans are Protestant, specially Evangelicals (with Pentecostals as the biggest branch).[40] Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy claim rapid growth, especially among the Indigenous Maya. Other churches include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Christian minorities. More than 60% of Catholics and 80% of Protestants are actives members,[40] today Catholicism and Protestantism are more unity to obtain the Politic control against globalization influence such as the acceptance of Homosexuality, abortion and other Human rights. Although Christianity is largely influential in public complex, since 1990 decade there are notable presence of non-religious people in surveys of religious identification.\n\n\nIndigenous beliefs are sometimes combined with Christianity.[40] Maya religion believers only account for less than 0.1% of the population and since the mid-1990s the Constitution recognizes the rights of Maya Religion. The Islamic community in Guatemala is growing, and is projected to include at least 2,000 believers by 2030.[41] There is a mosque in Guatemala City called the Islamic Da'wah Mosque of Guatemala (Spanish: Mezquita de Aldawaa Islámica). The president of the Islamic Community of the country is Jamal Mubarak.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Religious evolution in Guatemala[40] |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | % Catholic\n | % Protestants\n | % Others\n | % No religion\n | Source\n |\n| 1980\n | 78%\n | 13.1%\n | 4.9%\n | 4.0%\n | National Christian-Survey, June 1980\n |\n| 1990\n | 67.5%\n | 20.9%\n | 2.0%\n | 9.6%\n | CID-Gallup, September 1990\n |\n| 2001\n | 55%\n | 29.9%\n | 2.4%\n | 12.7%\n | CID-Gallup, November 2001\n |\n| 2012\n | 47.9%\n | 38.2%\n | 2.3%\n | 11.6%\n | CID-Gallup, September 2012\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Resultados Del Censo 2018\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Caracterización estadística República de Guatemala 2012\" (PDF).
