It is organized around shared values of pluralism, liberal democracy, and representative government.[1][2][3] G7 members are the major IMF advanced economies.\n\n\nOriginating from an *ad hoc* gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[4] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\n\nThe G7 is not based on a treaty and has no permanent secretariat or office. It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting the summit; Japan presides for 2023.[5] While lacking a legal or institutional basis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence;[6] it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement.[6][1][7] However, the group has been criticized by observers for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and ineffectualness.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe concept of a forum for the capitalist world's major industrialized countries emerged before the 1973 oil crisis. On 25 March 1973, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, George Shultz, convened an informal gathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France (Valéry Giscard d'Estaing), and the United Kingdom (Anthony Barber) before an upcoming meeting in Washington, D.C. U.S. President Richard Nixon offered the White House as a venue, and the meeting was subsequently held in its library on the ground floor;[11] the original group of four consequently became known as the \"Library Group\".[12] In mid-1973, at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Shultz proposed the addition of Japan, which all members accepted.[11] The informal gathering of senior financial officials from the U.S., U.K., West Germany, Japan, and France became known as the \"Group of Five\".[13]\n\n\nIn 1974, all five members endured sudden and often troubled changes in leadership. French President Georges Pompidou abruptly died, leading to a fresh presidential election that was closely won by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, American President Richard Nixon, and Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka all resigned due to scandals. In the United Kingdom, a hung election led to a minority government whose subsequent instability prompted another election the same year. Consequently, Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, proposed a retreat the following year for the group's new leaders to learn about one another.\n\n\n\n### First summit and expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First G6 summit at the Chateau de Rambouillet in November 1975\nAt the initiative of Giscard d'Estaing and his German counterpart, Helmut Schmidt, France hosted a three-day summit in November 1975, inviting the Group of Five plus Italy, forming the \"Group of Six\" (G6).[14] Taking place at the Château de Rambouillet, the meeting focused on several major economic issues, including the oil crisis, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and the ongoing global recession.[15] The result was the 15-point \"Declaration of Rambouillet\", which, among other positions, announced the group's united commitment to promoting free trade, multilateralism, cooperation with the developing world, and rapprochement with the Eastern Bloc.[16] The members also established plans for future gatherings to take place regularly every year.\n\n\nIn 1976, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had participated in the first G6 summit, resigned from office; Schmidt and Ford believed the group needed an English speaker with more political experience, and advocated for inviting Pierre Trudeau, who had been Prime Minister of Canada for eight years – significantly longer than any G6 leader. Canada was also the next largest advanced economy after the G6 members.[17] The summit in Dorado, Puerto Rico later that year became the first of the current Group of Seven (G7).[15]\n\n\nIn 1977, the United Kingdom, which hosted that year's summit, invited the European Economic Community to join all G7 summits; beginning in 1981, it has attended every gathering through the president of the European Commission and the leader of the country holding the presidency of the Council of the European Union.[18] Since 2009, the then-newly established position of the President of the European Council, who serves as the Union's principal foreign representative, also regularly attends the summits.\n\n\n\n### Rising profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Flags of G7 members as seen on University Avenue, Toronto (September 2016)\nUntil the 1985 Plaza Accord, meetings between the seven governments' finance ministers were not public knowledge. The Accord, which involved only the original Group of Five, was announced the day before it was finalized, with a communiqué issued afterward.[19] The 1980s also marked the G7's expanded concerns beyond macroeconomic issues, namely with respect to international security and conflict; for example, it sought to address the ongoing conflicts between Iran and Iraq and between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.\n\n\nFollowing the 1994 summit in Naples, Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7. This informal arrangement was dubbed the \"Political 8\" (P8), colloquially the G7+1. At the invitation of the G7 leaders, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was invited first as a guest observer, and later as a full participant. After the 1997 meeting, Russia was formally invited to the next meeting and formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of Eight (G8).[15] Russia was an outlier in the group, as it lacked the national wealth and financial weight of other members, had never been a major advanced economy, and was not yet an established liberal democracy.[20][21] Its invitation, made during a difficult transition to a post-communist economy, is believed to have been motivated by a desire to encourage its political and economic reforms and international engagement.\n\n\nRussia's membership was suspended in March 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea.[22][23][24] Members stopped short of permanently ejecting the country,[25] and in subsequent years expressed an openness or express desire to reinstate Russian participation. In January 2017, Russia announced it would permanently leave the G8, which came into effect June 2018.[26][27] In 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, backed by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, advocated for Russia's return; all other members rejected the proposal, and Russia expressed no interest.[28]\n\n\n\n## Renewed calls for expanded membership[edit]\n\n\nThere have been various proposals to expand the G7. The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic order\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countries – including India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain – participate as observers.[29] Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group;[30] This is also favored by various think tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.[29]\n\n\nIn 2019 under Putin, Russia had signaled support for the inclusion of China, India, and Turkey if the G7 had reinstated Russian membership.[31]\n\n\nIn 2020 under Trump, the U.S. had signaled support for the inclusion of Australia, Brazil, India, and South Korea, plus the reincorporation of Russia.[32][33] The leaders of the other six G7 members unanimously rejected this proposal.[34]\n\n\nAlso in November 2020, Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine, writing in Foreign Affairs, suggested that the G7 might be expanded to a \"T-12\" of \"Techno Democracies\". Earlier, in June of that same year, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) was announced. Something of a spin-out of the G7, founded by members Canada and France, GPAI's initial membership was 15, including both the EU and India, as well as Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, and the Republic of Korea.\n\n\nBoris Johnson invited members of Australia and the Republic of Korea to the June 2021 G7 summit.[30] India was also invited to the 2021 summit, with an aim to \"deepen the expertise and experience around the table\" along with the other guests, according to a U.K. government statement.[35]\n\n\nIn 2021, French jurist and consultant Eric Garner de Béville, a member of the *Cercle Montesquieu*, proposed Spain's membership to the G7.[36] American Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Conrad Tribble, stated that the United States \"enthusiastically supports\" a \"greater\" role of Spanish leadership at the international level.[37]\n\n\nIn 2022, Germany has confirmed it will be inviting India,[38] against rumours to the contrary.[39][40][*needs update*]\n\n\nIn 2023, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida invited South Korea, Australia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Comoros (representing the African Union), the Cook Islands (representing the Pacific Islands Forum) and Ukraine to the 49th summit hosted in Hiroshima.[41][42][43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Activities and initiatives[edit]\n\n\n![G7 is located in Europe](image)![1st](image)\n1st\n![3rd, 10th, 17th](image)\n3rd, 10th, 17th\n![4th, 11th](image)\n4th, 11th\n![6th, 13th](image)\n6th, 13th\n![8th](image)\n8th\n![15th](image)\n15th\n![18th](image)\n18th\n![20th](image)\n20th\n![22nd](image)\n22nd\n![24th](image)\n24th\n![25th](image)\n25th\n![27th](image)\n27th\n![29th](image)\n29th\n![31st](image)\n31st\n![32nd](image)\n32nd\n![33rd](image)\n33rd\n![35th](image)\n35th\n![37th](image)\n37th\n![39th](image)\n39th\n![40th](image)\n40th\n![41st](image)\n41st\n![43rd'](image)\n43rd'\n![45th](image)\n45th\n![47th](image)\n47th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Europe\n\nThe G7 was founded primarily to facilitate shared macroeconomic initiatives in response to contemporary economic problems; the first gathering was centered around the Nixon shock, the 1970s energy crisis, and the ensuing global recession.[47] Since 1975, the group has met annually at summits organized and hosted by whichever country occupies the annually-rotating presidency;[48] since 1987, the G7 Finance Ministers have met at least semi-annually, and up to four times a year at stand-alone meetings.[49]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the G7 broadened its areas of concern to include issues of international security, human rights, and global security; for example, during this period, the G7 concerned itself with the ongoing Iran-Iraq War and Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.[48] In the 1990s, it launched a debt-relief program for the 42 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC);[50] provided $300 million to help build the Shelter Structure over the damaged reactor at Chernobyl;[51] and established the Financial Stability Forum to help in \"managing the international monetary system\".[52]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in North America](image)![2nd](image)\n2nd\n![7th](image)\n7th\n![9th](image)\n9th\n![14th](image)\n14th\n![16th](image)\n16th\n![21st](image)\n21st\n![23rd](image)\n23rd\n![28th](image)\n28th\n![30th](image)\n30th\n![36th](image)\n36th\n![38th](image)\n38th\n![44th](image)\n44th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in North America\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the G7 began emphasizing engagement with the developing world. At the 1999 summit, the group helped launch the G20, a similar forum made up of the G7 and the next 13 largest economies (including the European Union), in order to \"promote dialogue between major industrial and emerging market countries\";[52] the G20 has been touted by some of its members as a replacement for the G7.[53] Having previously announced a plan to cancel 90% of bilateral debt for the HIPC, totaling $100 billion, in 2005 the G7 announced debt reductions of \"up to 100%\" to be negotiated on a \"case by case\" basis.[54]\n\n\nFollowing the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which was the worst of its kind since the 1970s,[55] the G7 met twice in Washington, D.C. in 2008 and in Rome, the following February.[56][57] News media reported that much of the world was looking to the group for leadership and solutions.[58] G7 finance ministers pledged to take \"all necessary steps\" to stem the crisis,[59] devising an \"aggressive action plan\" that included providing publicly funded capital infusions to banks in danger of failing.[60] Some analysts criticized the group for seemingly advocating that individual governments develop individual responses to the recession, rather than cohere around a united effort.[61]\n\n\nIn subsequent years, the G7 has faced several geopolitical challenges that have led some international analysts to question its credibility,[62] or propose its replacement by the G20.[63] On 2 March 2014, the G7 condemned the Russian Federation for its \"violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\" through its military intervention.[64] The group also announced its commitment to \"mobilize rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in addressing its macroeconomic, regulatory and anti-corruption challenges\", while adding that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was best suited to stabilizing the country's finances and economy.[64]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in Japan](image)![5th, 12th, 19th](image)\n5th, 12th, 19th\n![26th](image)\n26th\n![34th](image)\n34th\n![42nd](image)\n42nd\n![49th](image)\n49th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Japan\n\nIn response to Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea, on 24 March the G7 convened an emergency meeting at the official residence of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Catshuis in The Hague; this location was chosen because all G7 leaders were already present to attend the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the Netherlands. This was the first G7 meeting neither taking place in a member state nor having the host leader participating in the meeting.[65] The upcoming G8 summit in Sochi, Russia was moved to Brussels, where the EU was the host. On 5 June 2014 the G7 condemned Moscow for its \"continuing violation\" of Ukraine's sovereignty and stated they were prepared to impose further sanctions on Russia.[66] This meeting was the first since Russia was suspended from the G8,[66] and subsequently it has not been involved in any G7 summit.\n\n\nThe G7 has continued to take a strong stance against Russia's \"destabilising behaviour and malign activities\" in Ukraine and elsewhere around the world, following the joint communique from the June 2021 summit in the U.K.[67] The group also called on Russia to address international cybercrime attacks launched from within its borders, and to investigate the use of chemical weapons on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.[67] The June 2021 summit also saw the G7 commit to helping the world recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic (including plans to help vaccinate the entire world); encourage further action against climate change and biodiversity loss; and promote \"shared values\" of pluralism and democracy.[35]\n\n\nIn 2022, G7 leaders were invited to attend an extraordinary summit of NATO called in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Summit organization[edit]\n\n\nThe annual G7 summit is attended by each member's head of government.[70] The member country holding the G7 presidency is responsible for organizing and hosting the year's summit. The serial annual summits can be parsed chronologically in arguably distinct ways, including as the sequence of host countries for the summits has recurred over time and series.[71] Generally every country hosts the summit once every seven years.[72]\n\n\nBesides a main meeting in June or July, a number of other meetings may take place throughout the year; in 2021 for example, seven tracks existed for finance (4–5 June 2021), environmental (20 and 21 May 2021), health (3–4 June 2021), trade (27–28 May 2021), interior (7–9 September 2021) digital and technology (28–29 April 2021), development (3–5 May 2021) and foreign ministers.[73]\n\n\n\n\n## List of summits[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOverview of G7 summits\n| #\n | Date\n | Host\n | Host leader\n | Location held\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st | 15–17 November 1975 | ![](image) France | Valéry Giscard d'Estaing | Château de Rambouillet, Yvelines | The first and last G6 summit.\n |\n| 2nd | 27–28 June 1976 | ![](image) United States | Gerald R.

Angola, Denmark, Netherlands, and Spain accepted their invitations for the first time.[79] A record of 11 international organizations were represented in this summit.

North Korea was urged to comply with UN resolutions, and Russian responsibility for the Ukrainian conflict was stressed. Supporting economic activity and ensuring price stability was demanded, while inequalities in trade and gender were called to be challenged. It was agreed to help countries in creating conditions that address the drivers of migration: ending hunger, increasing competitiveness, and advancing global health security.[102][103] |\n| 44th | 8–9 June 2018 | ![](image) Canada[104] | Justin Trudeau | La Malbaie, Québec (Charlevoix)[105] | The summit took place at the Manoir Richelieu. Prime Minister Trudeau announced five themes for Canada's G7 presidency, which began in January 2018.

US President Donald Trump did not agree to the economic section of the final statement.[107] The G7 members also announced to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures against Russian Federation for its failure to implement the Minsk Protocol completely.[108] |\n| 45th | 24–26 August 2019 | ![](image) France[109] | Emmanuel Macron | Biarritz, Pyrénées-Atlantiques | It was agreed at the summit that the World Trade Organization, \"with regard to intellectual property protection, to settle disputes more swiftly and to eliminate unfair trade practices\", \"to simplify regulatory barriers and modernize international taxation within the framework of the OECD\", \"to ensure that Iran never acquires nuclear weapons and to foster peace and stability in the region\", and \"to support a truce in Libya that will lead to a long-term ceasefire\".

The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Crédit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of G7 members\n| Member\n | Trade mil.

About 300 of those reached the 3 m high and 7 km long security fence surrounding the summit location. The protesters questioned the legitimacy of the G7 to make decisions that could affect the whole world. Authorities had banned demonstrations in the area closest to the summit location and 20,000 police were on duty in Southern Bavaria to keep activists and protesters from interfering with the summit.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### 2018 Trump conflict over tariffs and Russia[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 44th G7 summit and Russo-Ukrainian War\n\nThe 2018 meeting in Charlevoix, Canada, was marred by fractious negotiations concerning tariffs and Donald Trump's position that Russia should be reinstated to the G7. The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump's economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting not to sign the economic section of the joint communiqué that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump's behaviour as a \"depressing withdrawal\", while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him \"to be serious\".[136] In the final statement signed by all members except the US, the G7 announced its intention to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures within the next months against the Russian Federation for its failure to completely implement the Minsk Agreement.[108]\n\n\nTrump repeated calls for Russia to be re-admitted to the group at the 2019 meeting in Biarritz, saying it should be included in discussions relating to Iran, Syria, and North Korea. The Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte supported Trump's proposal, Shinzo Abe of Japan was neutral, and the rest of the G7 pushed back against the suggestion, after which the atmosphere allegedly became \"tense\". [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Amazon rainforest fires and Brazil[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 45th G7 summit and 2019 Brazil wildfires\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's reiteration that Russia should be readmitted to the group (see above), the instigation of a trade war with China, increased tensions in Iran, Trump's alleged reluctance to attend the conference, and a number of international crises made the 2019 G7 meeting in Biarritz, France, the most divided since its inception. Following President Trump's previous revocation of his signature to a joint communiqué agreed to in 2018 due to an alleged slight from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (see above), French President Emmanuel Macron agreed that the group would not issue a joint communiqué at the Biarritz conference.\n\n\nThe G7 nations pledged US$20 million to help Brazil and other countries in South America fight the wildfires. This money was welcomed, although it was widely seen as a \"relatively small amount\" given the scale of the problem. Macron threatened to block a major trade deal between the European Union and Brazil (Mercosur) that would benefit the agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Build Back Better World\n* Capitalism\n* D-10 Strategy Forum\n* Developed country\n* E7 (countries)\n* G4 (EU)\n* G6 (EU)\n* G8\n* G8+5\n* G10 currencies\n* G20\n* Great power\n* Group of Twelve (G12)\n* Junior 8\n* List of country groupings\n* List of G7 leaders\n* List of multilateral free trade agreements\n* OECD\n* Quint\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"What is the G7?\". *G7 UK Presidency 2021*.

It is organized around shared values of pluralism, liberal democracy, and representative government.[1][2][3] G7 members are the major IMF advanced economies.\n\n\nOriginating from an *ad hoc* gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[4] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\n\nThe G7 is not based on a treaty and has no permanent secretariat or office. It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting the summit; Japan presides for 2023.[5] While lacking a legal or institutional basis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence;[6] it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement.[6][1][7] However, the group has been criticized by observers for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and ineffectualness.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe concept of a forum for the capitalist world's major industrialized countries emerged before the 1973 oil crisis. On 25 March 1973, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, George Shultz, convened an informal gathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France (Valéry Giscard d'Estaing), and the United Kingdom (Anthony Barber) before an upcoming meeting in Washington, D.C. U.S. President Richard Nixon offered the White House as a venue, and the meeting was subsequently held in its library on the ground floor;[11] the original group of four consequently became known as the \"Library Group\".[12] In mid-1973, at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Shultz proposed the addition of Japan, which all members accepted.[11] The informal gathering of senior financial officials from the U.S., U.K., West Germany, Japan, and France became known as the \"Group of Five\".[13]\n\n\nIn 1974, all five members endured sudden and often troubled changes in leadership. French President Georges Pompidou abruptly died, leading to a fresh presidential election that was closely won by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, American President Richard Nixon, and Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka all resigned due to scandals. In the United Kingdom, a hung election led to a minority government whose subsequent instability prompted another election the same year. Consequently, Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, proposed a retreat the following year for the group's new leaders to learn about one another.\n\n\n\n### First summit and expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First G6 summit at the Chateau de Rambouillet in November 1975\nAt the initiative of Giscard d'Estaing and his German counterpart, Helmut Schmidt, France hosted a three-day summit in November 1975, inviting the Group of Five plus Italy, forming the \"Group of Six\" (G6).[14] Taking place at the Château de Rambouillet, the meeting focused on several major economic issues, including the oil crisis, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and the ongoing global recession.[15] The result was the 15-point \"Declaration of Rambouillet\", which, among other positions, announced the group's united commitment to promoting free trade, multilateralism, cooperation with the developing world, and rapprochement with the Eastern Bloc.[16] The members also established plans for future gatherings to take place regularly every year.\n\n\nIn 1976, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had participated in the first G6 summit, resigned from office; Schmidt and Ford believed the group needed an English speaker with more political experience, and advocated for inviting Pierre Trudeau, who had been Prime Minister of Canada for eight years – significantly longer than any G6 leader. Canada was also the next largest advanced economy after the G6 members.[17] The summit in Dorado, Puerto Rico later that year became the first of the current Group of Seven (G7).[15]\n\n\nIn 1977, the United Kingdom, which hosted that year's summit, invited the European Economic Community to join all G7 summits; beginning in 1981, it has attended every gathering through the president of the European Commission and the leader of the country holding the presidency of the Council of the European Union.[18] Since 2009, the then-newly established position of the President of the European Council, who serves as the Union's principal foreign representative, also regularly attends the summits.\n\n\n\n### Rising profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Flags of G7 members as seen on University Avenue, Toronto (September 2016)\nUntil the 1985 Plaza Accord, meetings between the seven governments' finance ministers were not public knowledge. The Accord, which involved only the original Group of Five, was announced the day before it was finalized, with a communiqué issued afterward.[19] The 1980s also marked the G7's expanded concerns beyond macroeconomic issues, namely with respect to international security and conflict; for example, it sought to address the ongoing conflicts between Iran and Iraq and between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.\n\n\nFollowing the 1994 summit in Naples, Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7. This informal arrangement was dubbed the \"Political 8\" (P8), colloquially the G7+1. At the invitation of the G7 leaders, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was invited first as a guest observer, and later as a full participant. After the 1997 meeting, Russia was formally invited to the next meeting and formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of Eight (G8).[15] Russia was an outlier in the group, as it lacked the national wealth and financial weight of other members, had never been a major advanced economy, and was not yet an established liberal democracy.[20][21] Its invitation, made during a difficult transition to a post-communist economy, is believed to have been motivated by a desire to encourage its political and economic reforms and international engagement.\n\n\nRussia's membership was suspended in March 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea.[22][23][24] Members stopped short of permanently ejecting the country,[25] and in subsequent years expressed an openness or express desire to reinstate Russian participation. In January 2017, Russia announced it would permanently leave the G8, which came into effect June 2018.[26][27] In 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, backed by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, advocated for Russia's return; all other members rejected the proposal, and Russia expressed no interest.[28]\n\n\n\n## Renewed calls for expanded membership[edit]\n\n\nThere have been various proposals to expand the G7. The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic order\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countries – including India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain – participate as observers.[29] Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group;[30] This is also favored by various think tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.[29]\n\n\nIn 2019 under Putin, Russia had signaled support for the inclusion of China, India, and Turkey if the G7 had reinstated Russian membership.[31]\n\n\nIn 2020 under Trump, the U.S. had signaled support for the inclusion of Australia, Brazil, India, and South Korea, plus the reincorporation of Russia.[32][33] The leaders of the other six G7 members unanimously rejected this proposal.[34]\n\n\nAlso in November 2020, Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine, writing in Foreign Affairs, suggested that the G7 might be expanded to a \"T-12\" of \"Techno Democracies\". Earlier, in June of that same year, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) was announced. Something of a spin-out of the G7, founded by members Canada and France, GPAI's initial membership was 15, including both the EU and India, as well as Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, and the Republic of Korea.\n\n\nBoris Johnson invited members of Australia and the Republic of Korea to the June 2021 G7 summit.[30] India was also invited to the 2021 summit, with an aim to \"deepen the expertise and experience around the table\" along with the other guests, according to a U.K. government statement.[35]\n\n\nIn 2021, French jurist and consultant Eric Garner de Béville, a member of the *Cercle Montesquieu*, proposed Spain's membership to the G7.[36] American Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Conrad Tribble, stated that the United States \"enthusiastically supports\" a \"greater\" role of Spanish leadership at the international level.[37]\n\n\nIn 2022, Germany has confirmed it will be inviting India,[38] against rumours to the contrary.[39][40][*needs update*]\n\n\nIn 2023, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida invited South Korea, Australia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Comoros (representing the African Union), the Cook Islands (representing the Pacific Islands Forum) and Ukraine to the 49th summit hosted in Hiroshima.[41][42][43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Activities and initiatives[edit]\n\n\n![G7 is located in Europe](image)![1st](image)\n1st\n![3rd, 10th, 17th](image)\n3rd, 10th, 17th\n![4th, 11th](image)\n4th, 11th\n![6th, 13th](image)\n6th, 13th\n![8th](image)\n8th\n![15th](image)\n15th\n![18th](image)\n18th\n![20th](image)\n20th\n![22nd](image)\n22nd\n![24th](image)\n24th\n![25th](image)\n25th\n![27th](image)\n27th\n![29th](image)\n29th\n![31st](image)\n31st\n![32nd](image)\n32nd\n![33rd](image)\n33rd\n![35th](image)\n35th\n![37th](image)\n37th\n![39th](image)\n39th\n![40th](image)\n40th\n![41st](image)\n41st\n![43rd'](image)\n43rd'\n![45th](image)\n45th\n![47th](image)\n47th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Europe\n\nThe G7 was founded primarily to facilitate shared macroeconomic initiatives in response to contemporary economic problems; the first gathering was centered around the Nixon shock, the 1970s energy crisis, and the ensuing global recession.[47] Since 1975, the group has met annually at summits organized and hosted by whichever country occupies the annually-rotating presidency;[48] since 1987, the G7 Finance Ministers have met at least semi-annually, and up to four times a year at stand-alone meetings.[49]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the G7 broadened its areas of concern to include issues of international security, human rights, and global security; for example, during this period, the G7 concerned itself with the ongoing Iran-Iraq War and Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.[48] In the 1990s, it launched a debt-relief program for the 42 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC);[50] provided $300 million to help build the Shelter Structure over the damaged reactor at Chernobyl;[51] and established the Financial Stability Forum to help in \"managing the international monetary system\".[52]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in North America](image)![2nd](image)\n2nd\n![7th](image)\n7th\n![9th](image)\n9th\n![14th](image)\n14th\n![16th](image)\n16th\n![21st](image)\n21st\n![23rd](image)\n23rd\n![28th](image)\n28th\n![30th](image)\n30th\n![36th](image)\n36th\n![38th](image)\n38th\n![44th](image)\n44th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in North America\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the G7 began emphasizing engagement with the developing world. At the 1999 summit, the group helped launch the G20, a similar forum made up of the G7 and the next 13 largest economies (including the European Union), in order to \"promote dialogue between major industrial and emerging market countries\";[52] the G20 has been touted by some of its members as a replacement for the G7.[53] Having previously announced a plan to cancel 90% of bilateral debt for the HIPC, totaling $100 billion, in 2005 the G7 announced debt reductions of \"up to 100%\" to be negotiated on a \"case by case\" basis.[54]\n\n\nFollowing the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which was the worst of its kind since the 1970s,[55] the G7 met twice in Washington, D.C. in 2008 and in Rome, the following February.[56][57] News media reported that much of the world was looking to the group for leadership and solutions.[58] G7 finance ministers pledged to take \"all necessary steps\" to stem the crisis,[59] devising an \"aggressive action plan\" that included providing publicly funded capital infusions to banks in danger of failing.[60] Some analysts criticized the group for seemingly advocating that individual governments develop individual responses to the recession, rather than cohere around a united effort.[61]\n\n\nIn subsequent years, the G7 has faced several geopolitical challenges that have led some international analysts to question its credibility,[62] or propose its replacement by the G20.[63] On 2 March 2014, the G7 condemned the Russian Federation for its \"violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\" through its military intervention.[64] The group also announced its commitment to \"mobilize rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in addressing its macroeconomic, regulatory and anti-corruption challenges\", while adding that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was best suited to stabilizing the country's finances and economy.[64]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in Japan](image)![5th, 12th, 19th](image)\n5th, 12th, 19th\n![26th](image)\n26th\n![34th](image)\n34th\n![42nd](image)\n42nd\n![49th](image)\n49th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Japan\n\nIn response to Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea, on 24 March the G7 convened an emergency meeting at the official residence of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Catshuis in The Hague; this location was chosen because all G7 leaders were already present to attend the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the Netherlands. This was the first G7 meeting neither taking place in a member state nor having the host leader participating in the meeting.[65] The upcoming G8 summit in Sochi, Russia was moved to Brussels, where the EU was the host. On 5 June 2014 the G7 condemned Moscow for its \"continuing violation\" of Ukraine's sovereignty and stated they were prepared to impose further sanctions on Russia.[66] This meeting was the first since Russia was suspended from the G8,[66] and subsequently it has not been involved in any G7 summit.\n\n\nThe G7 has continued to take a strong stance against Russia's \"destabilising behaviour and malign activities\" in Ukraine and elsewhere around the world, following the joint communique from the June 2021 summit in the U.K.[67] The group also called on Russia to address international cybercrime attacks launched from within its borders, and to investigate the use of chemical weapons on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.[67] The June 2021 summit also saw the G7 commit to helping the world recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic (including plans to help vaccinate the entire world); encourage further action against climate change and biodiversity loss; and promote \"shared values\" of pluralism and democracy.[35]\n\n\nIn 2022, G7 leaders were invited to attend an extraordinary summit of NATO called in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Summit organization[edit]\n\n\nThe annual G7 summit is attended by each member's head of government.[70] The member country holding the G7 presidency is responsible for organizing and hosting the year's summit. The serial annual summits can be parsed chronologically in arguably distinct ways, including as the sequence of host countries for the summits has recurred over time and series.[71] Generally every country hosts the summit once every seven years.[72]\n\n\nBesides a main meeting in June or July, a number of other meetings may take place throughout the year; in 2021 for example, seven tracks existed for finance (4–5 June 2021), environmental (20 and 21 May 2021), health (3–4 June 2021), trade (27–28 May 2021), interior (7–9 September 2021) digital and technology (28–29 April 2021), development (3–5 May 2021) and foreign ministers.[73]\n\n\n\n\n## List of summits[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOverview of G7 summits\n| #\n | Date\n | Host\n | Host leader\n | Location held\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st | 15–17 November 1975 | ![](image) France | Valéry Giscard d'Estaing | Château de Rambouillet, Yvelines | The first and last G6 summit.\n |\n| 2nd | 27–28 June 1976 | ![](image) United States | Gerald R.

US President Donald Trump did not agree to the economic section of the final statement.[107] The G7 members also announced to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures against Russian Federation for its failure to implement the Minsk Protocol completely.[108] |\n| 45th | 24–26 August 2019 | ![](image) France[109] | Emmanuel Macron | Biarritz, Pyrénées-Atlantiques | It was agreed at the summit that the World Trade Organization, \"with regard to intellectual property protection, to settle disputes more swiftly and to eliminate unfair trade practices\", \"to simplify regulatory barriers and modernize international taxation within the framework of the OECD\", \"to ensure that Iran never acquires nuclear weapons and to foster peace and stability in the region\", and \"to support a truce in Libya that will lead to a long-term ceasefire\".

The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Crédit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of G7 members\n| Member\n | Trade mil.

About 300 of those reached the 3 m high and 7 km long security fence surrounding the summit location. The protesters questioned the legitimacy of the G7 to make decisions that could affect the whole world. Authorities had banned demonstrations in the area closest to the summit location and 20,000 police were on duty in Southern Bavaria to keep activists and protesters from interfering with the summit.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### 2018 Trump conflict over tariffs and Russia[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 44th G7 summit and Russo-Ukrainian War\n\nThe 2018 meeting in Charlevoix, Canada, was marred by fractious negotiations concerning tariffs and Donald Trump's position that Russia should be reinstated to the G7. The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump's economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting not to sign the economic section of the joint communiqué that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump's behaviour as a \"depressing withdrawal\", while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him \"to be serious\".[136] In the final statement signed by all members except the US, the G7 announced its intention to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures within the next months against the Russian Federation for its failure to completely implement the Minsk Agreement.[108]\n\n\nTrump repeated calls for Russia to be re-admitted to the group at the 2019 meeting in Biarritz, saying it should be included in discussions relating to Iran, Syria, and North Korea. The Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte supported Trump's proposal, Shinzo Abe of Japan was neutral, and the rest of the G7 pushed back against the suggestion, after which the atmosphere allegedly became \"tense\". [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Amazon rainforest fires and Brazil[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 45th G7 summit and 2019 Brazil wildfires\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's reiteration that Russia should be readmitted to the group (see above), the instigation of a trade war with China, increased tensions in Iran, Trump's alleged reluctance to attend the conference, and a number of international crises made the 2019 G7 meeting in Biarritz, France, the most divided since its inception. Following President Trump's previous revocation of his signature to a joint communiqué agreed to in 2018 due to an alleged slight from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (see above), French President Emmanuel Macron agreed that the group would not issue a joint communiqué at the Biarritz conference.\n\n\nThe G7 nations pledged US$20 million to help Brazil and other countries in South America fight the wildfires. This money was welcomed, although it was widely seen as a \"relatively small amount\" given the scale of the problem. Macron threatened to block a major trade deal between the European Union and Brazil (Mercosur) that would benefit the agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Build Back Better World\n* Capitalism\n* D-10 Strategy Forum\n* Developed country\n* E7 (countries)\n* G4 (EU)\n* G6 (EU)\n* G8\n* G8+5\n* G10 currencies\n* G20\n* Great power\n* Group of Twelve (G12)\n* Junior 8\n* List of country groupings\n* List of G7 leaders\n* List of multilateral free trade agreements\n* OECD\n* Quint\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"What is the G7?\". *G7 UK Presidency 2021*.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world's second-largest country by total area, with the world's longest coastline. Its border with the United States is the world's longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely inhabited country of 40 million people, the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, and culminating in the *Canada Act 1982*, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nCanada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is \"called upon\" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and gender equality. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.\n\n\nA developed country, Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs, with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has had a significant influence on its global image. Canada is part of multiple major international and intergovernmental institutions.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Canada\n\nWhile a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of *Canada*, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word *kanata*, meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\".[9] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word *Canada* to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as *Canada*.[10]\n\n\nFrom the 16th to the early 18th century, \"Canada\" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These two colonies were collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12]\n\n\nUpon Confederation in 1867, *Canada* was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word *dominion* was conferred as the country's title.[13] By the 1950s, the term *Dominion of Canada* was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"realm of the Commonwealth\".[14]\n\n\nThe *Canada Act 1982*, which brought the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to *Canada*. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[15] The term *Dominion* was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term *federal* had replaced *dominion*.[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Canada\n\nFurther information: Timeline of Canadian history and Historiography of Canada\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nIndigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis,[17] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity.[17]\n\n\nThe first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.[18][19] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.[20] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.[21][22] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.[23]\n\n\n\n![Colour-coded map of North America showing the distribution of North American language families north of Mexico](image)Linguistic areas of North American Indigenous peoples at the time of European contact[24]\nThe Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000[25] and two million,[26] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.[27] As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared.[28] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity,[25][29] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.[30][31]\n\n\nAlthough not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.[32] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade.[33] These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties.[34][35] From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society.[36] These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration through state-funded boarding schools,[37] health-care segregation,[38] and displacement.[39] A period of redress began with the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.[40] This included recognition of past colonial injustices and settlement agreements and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### European colonization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of territorial claims in North America by 1750. Possessions of British America (pink), New France (blue), and New Spain (orange); California, Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin not indicated.[42]\nIt is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson.[43][44] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland.[45] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England.[46] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words, \"long live the King of France\", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I.[47] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[48] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[49][50]\n\n\nIn 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp.[51] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence.[45] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[52] Among the colonists of New France, *Canadiens* extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.[53] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.[54]\n\n\nThe English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the Thirteen Colonies to the south.[55][56] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[57] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.[58]\n\n\n\n### British North America[edit]\n\n\n![Painting of General Wolfe dying in front of the British flag while attended by officers and native allies](image)Benjamin West's *The Death of General Wolfe* (1771) dramatizes James Wolfe's death during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec.[59]\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[15] St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769.[60] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.[61] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.[62] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.[63] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.[15]\n\n\nAfter the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[64] The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city.[65] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.[66]\n\n\n\n![Painting of Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams](image)War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams[67]\nThe Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed.[68] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850.[69] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances.[70] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.[25]\n\n\nThe desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[71] The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.[15] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.[72] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[73] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–BC border.[74]\n\n\n\n### Confederation and expansion[edit]\n\n\n![Refer to caption](image)Animated map showing the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories since Confederation in 1867[75]\nFollowing three constitutional conferences, the *British North America Act, 1867* officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.[76][77] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[78] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[79] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.[80] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[80] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US.[81]\n\n\nTo open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), passed the *Dominion Lands Act* to regulate settlement and established the North-West Mounted Police to assert authority over the territory.[82][83] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to \"Indian reserves\",[84] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements.[85] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land.[86] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands.[87] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves.[88] During this time, Canada introduced the *Indian Act* extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.[89]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century[edit]\n\n\n1918 Canadian War bond posters depicting three French women pulling a plow that had been constructed for horses\n![](image)\nFrench version of the poster roughly translates as \"They serve France–Everyone can serve; Buy Victory Bonds\".\n![](image)\nThe same poster in English, with subtle differences in text. \"They serve France—How can I serve Canada? Buy Victory Bonds\".\n\nBecause Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War.[90] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war.[91] Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded.[92] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers.[93] The *Military Service Act* brought in compulsory military service, though it, coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party.[93] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain,[91] and the *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, affirmed Canada's independence.[94]\n\n\nThe Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.[95] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s.[96] On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.[91]\n\n\nThe first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the Second World War and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.[97] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[91] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany.[98]\n\n\nThe Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union.[91] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.[99]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary era[edit]\n\n\nThe financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor.[100] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.[101]\n\n\nCanada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965,[102] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[103] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[104] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.[105]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)A copy of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*[106]\nFinally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the *Canada Act 1982*, the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.[107][108][109] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own monarchy.[110][111] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.[112]\n\n\nAt the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement.[113] The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970,[114] and the sovereignist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[115] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[116][117] A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[118] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional, and the Clarity Act was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.[115]\n\n\nIn addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;[119] the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students;[120] and the Oka Crisis of 1990,[121] the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups.[122] Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United States–led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.[123] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 but declined to join the United States–led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[124]\n\n\nIn 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War[125] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[126] The country celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2017, three years before the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27, 2020, with widespread social and economic disruption.[127] In 2021, the possible graves of hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools.[128] Administered by various Christian churches and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997, these boarding schools attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.[37]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Canada\n\n![refer to caption](image)A topographic map of Canada, in polar projection (for 90° W), showing elevations shaded from green to brown (higher)\nBy total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.[129] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes.[130] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory.[131] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi).[132][133] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States—spanning 8,891 km (5,525 mi)[a]—Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island,[134] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast.[135] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.[136]\n\n\nCanada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Arctic Archipelago.[137] Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northern Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[131] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada's economic output.[131] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of which are larger than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)—containing much of the world's fresh water.[138][139] There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains, and the Arctic Cordillera.[140] Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[141]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Temperature in Canada\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification types of Canada\nAverage winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[142] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[143]\n\n\nMuch of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost. The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[144] Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[131] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[145] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity in Canada.[146]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Canada\n\n![Map showing Canada divided into different ecozones](image)Terrestrial ecozones and ecoprovinces of Canada. Ecozones are identified with a unique colour. Ecoprovinces are subdivisions of ecozones and are identified with a unique numeric code.[147]\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[148] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[149] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries,[150] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost.[151] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\".[152] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[153] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 km2 (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[154] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions,[155] with 42 percent of its land area covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land).[156]\n\n\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park established in 1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi)[158] of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes.[159] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park, established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01 sq mi). It is dominated by old-growth forest with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers.[160] Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) of lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) of islands and mainland.[161] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area, which spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45 sq mi)[162] and protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia's seabirds.[163] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves cover a total area of 235,000 square kilometres (91,000 sq mi).[164]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Canada and Politics of Canada\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Canadian Parliament Buildings and their surroundings\nCanada is described as a \"full democracy\",[165] with a tradition of liberalism,[166] and an egalitarian,[167] moderate political ideology.[168] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.[169][170] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of the Canadian government.[171][172]\n\n\nAt the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising \"brokerage politics\":[b] the centre-left leaning Liberal Party of Canada[179][180] and the centre-right leaning Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors).[181] The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale.[181] Five parties had representatives elected to the Parliament in the 2021 election—the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official Opposition; the New Democratic Party (occupying the left[182][183]); the Bloc Québécois; and the Green Party of Canada.[184] Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.[185][186][187]\n\n\nCanada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy—the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[188][189][190][191] The reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other Commonwealth countries (though, all are sovereign of one another[192]) and each of Canada's 10 provinces. To carry out most of their federal royal duties in Canada, the monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister.[193][194]\n\n\n\n![King Charles III](image)\nCharles III, King of Canada\n![Governor General Mary Simon](image)\nMary Simon, Governor General of Canada\n![Prime Minister Justin Trudeau](image)\nJustin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada\n\nThe monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada.[191][195][196] However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in certain rare crisis situations,[195] the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative) is otherwise always directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister,[197] the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House of Commons.[198] The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies.[195] The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.[199]\n\n\n\n![The House of Commons chamber](image)The House of Commons in its temporary location, the West Block[200]\nThe Parliament of Canada passes all statute laws within the federal sphere. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the Senate. While Canada inherited the British concept of parliamentary supremacy, this was later, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law.[201]\n\n\nEach of the 338 members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The *Constitution Act, 1982*, requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the *Canada Elections Act* limits this to four years with a \"fixed\" election date in October; general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in the House.[202][203] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.[204]\n\n\nCanadian federalism divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons.[196] Canada's three territories also have legislatures; but, these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.[205] The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.[206]\n\n\nThe Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country.[207] The minister of finance and minister of innovation, science, and industry use the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development.[208] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes.[209] The bank does not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.[210]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Canada\n\nThe Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions.[211] The *Constitution Act, 1867* (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments.[212] The *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, granted full autonomy, and the *Constitution Act, 1982*, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.[213] The *Charter* guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government; though, a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the *Charter* for a period of five years.[214]\n\n\n\n![Supreme Court of Canada building](image)The Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill\nCanada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since December 18, 2017, by Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of Canada.[215] The governor general appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice.[216] The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.[217]\n\n\nCommon law prevails everywhere, except in Quebec, where civil law predominates.[218] Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.[219] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.[220] In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police.[221]\n\n\nCanadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada.[222] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples.[223] Most notably, a series of 11 treaties, known as the Numbered Treaties, were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.[224] These treaties are agreements between the Canadian Crown-in-Council, with the duty to consult and accommodate.[225] The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.[223] These rights may include provision of services, such as healthcare through the Indian Health Transfer Policy, and exemption from taxation.[226]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations and military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of Canada, Canadian Armed Forces, and Military history of Canada\n\n![Canadian Delegation to the United Nations seated around conference table](image)The Canadian delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization, San Francisco, May 1945[227]\nCanada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions.[228] Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions, international organizations, and the work of numerous federal institutions.[229][230] Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image.[231][232] The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.[233]\n\n\nCanada and the United States have a long, complex, and intertwined relationship;[234][235] they are close allies, co-operating regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts.[236][237] Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France,[238] along with both countries' former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie*.[239] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.[98] Canada was a founding member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, the G20, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[228] Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs.[240] Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976.[241] The country joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001.[242] Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).[243]\n\n\nCanada's earlier strong attachment to the British Empire and, later, the Commonwealth, led it to make significant contributions to British military efforts in the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the First World War (1914–1918), and the Second World War (1939–1945).[244] Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.[245][246] During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), in cooperation with the United States, to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.[247]\n\n\n\n![A fighter jet taking off from a runway](image)A Canadian McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet in \"special markings\" used by the 2014 CF-18 Demonstration Team[248]\nDuring the Suez Crisis of 1956, future prime minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.[249] As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.[250] Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989,[91] and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere. Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia affair.[251]\n\n\nIn 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the US stabilization force and the UN-authorized, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.[252] In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925.[253]\n\n\nThe unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\"[254]—with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers.[255][c] In 2021, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.4 billion, or around 1.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).[257] Canada's total military expenditure is expected to reach $32.7 billion by 2027.[258] Canada's military currently has over 3000 personnel deployed overseas in multiple operations, such as Operation Snowgoose in Cyprus, Operation Unifier supporting Ukraine, Operation Caribbe in the Caribbean Sea, and Operation Impact, a coalition for the military intervention against ISIL.[259]\n\n\n\n### Provinces and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Provinces and territories of Canada\n\nSee also: Canadian federalism\n\n![Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces and territories](image)Political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories[260]\nCanada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories. In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (*Eastern Canada* refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[261] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and welfare,[262] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[263]\n\n\nThe major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown[264] and power and authority from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada[265] and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council,[266] rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively[267] and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment, while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.[268]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Canada\n\n![](image)The Toronto financial district is the second-largest financial centre in North America, the seventh-largest globally in employment and the heart of Canada's finance industry.[269]\nCanada has a highly developed mixed-market economy,[270][271] with the world's ninth-largest economy as of 2023[update], and a nominal GDP of approximately US$2.221 trillion.[272] It is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy.[273] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion.[274] Canada's exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States.[274] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion.[274] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion.[275]\n\n\nCanada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions.[276] It ranks low in the Corruption Perceptions Index (14th in 2023)[277] and \"is widely regarded as among the least corrupt countries of the world\".[278] It ranks high in the Global Competitiveness Report (14th in 2019)[279] and Global Innovation Index (15th in 2023).[280] Canada's economy ranks above most Western nations on The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom[281] and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity.[282] The country's average household disposable income per capita is \"well above\" the OECD average.[283] Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability[284][285] and foreign direct investment.[286][285]\n\n\nSince the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one.[287] Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce.[288] Among developed countries, Canada has an unusually important primary sector, of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent components.[289] Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby mines or sources of timber.[290]\n\n\n\n![](image)Canada\nCountries and territories with free-trade agreements[291]\n\nCanada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II.[292] The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry.[293] The Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994 (later replaced by the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement).[294] As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade agreements with 51 different countries.[291]\n\n\nCanada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.[289][295] Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas,[296] and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world.[297] The vast Athabasca oil sands and other oil reserves give Canada 13 percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world's third or fourth-largest.[298] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains.[299] The country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium.[300][301] Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.[302] The fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy.[303]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Canada\n\nIn 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9 billion on domestic research and development, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion.[304] As of 2023[update], the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine.[305] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index,[306] and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms.[307] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population.[308]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Canadian-built Space Shuttle robotic arm (left), referred to as Canadarm, transferred the P5 truss segment over to the Canadian-built space station robotic arm, referred to as Canadarm2.[309]\nCanada's developments in science and technology include the creation of the modern alkaline battery,[310] the discovery of insulin,[311] the development of the polio vaccine,[312] and discoveries about the interior structure of the atomic nucleus.[313] Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial cardiac pacemaker, mapping the visual cortex,[314][315] the development of the electron microscope,[316][317] plate tectonics, deep learning, multi-touch technology, and the identification of the first black hole, Cygnus X-1.[318] Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include stem cells, site-directed mutagenesis, T-cell receptor, and the identification of the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases.[315][319]\n\n\nThe Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research and developing rockets and satellites.[320] Canada was the third country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch.[321] Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2, Canadarm3 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle.[322] Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS, and MOST.[323] Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant.[324]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Canada and List of cities in Canada\n\n![](image)Canada population density map (2014)[325]\nThe 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure.[326] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023.[327] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.[328] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[329] driven mainly by economic policy and also family reunification.[330][331] A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted to Canada in 2021.[332] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 28,000 in 2018.[333] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas in the country, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[334]\n\n\nCanada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world.[326] Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north and approximately 95 percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north.[335] About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the border with the contiguous United States.[336] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living urban centres.[337] The most densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[338][335]\n\n\nThe majority of Canadians (81.1 percent) live in family households, 12.1 percent report living alone, and those living with other relatives or unrelated persons reported at 6.8 percent.[339] Fifty-one percent of households are couples with or without children, 8.7 percent are single-parent households, 2.9 percent are multigenerational households, and 29.3 percent are single-person households.[339]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in Canada2021 Canadian census[340]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |\n| 1 | Toronto | Ontario | 6,202,225 | 11 | London | Ontario | 543,551\n |\n| 2 | Montreal | Quebec | 4,291,732 | 12 | Halifax | Nova Scotia | 465,703\n |\n| 3 | Vancouver | British Columbia | 2,642,825 | 13 | Niagara Region | Ontario | 433,604\n |\n| 4 | Ottawa–Gatineau | Ontario–Quebec | 1,488,307 | 14 | Windsor | Ontario | 422,630\n |\n| 5 | Calgary | Alberta | 1,481,806 | 15 | Oshawa | Ontario | 415,311\n |\n| 6 | Edmonton | Alberta | 1,418,118 | 16 | Victoria | British Columbia | 397,237\n |\n| 7 | Quebec City | Quebec | 839,311 | 17 | Saskatoon | Saskatchewan | 317,480\n |\n| 8 | Winnipeg | Manitoba | 834,678 | 18 | Regina | Saskatchewan | 249,217\n |\n| 9 | Hamilton | Ontario | 785,184 | 19 | Sherbrooke | Quebec | 227,398\n |\n| 10 | Waterloo Region | Ontario | 575,847 | 20 | Kelowna | British Columbia | 222,162\n |\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic origins of people in Canada\n\nAccording to the 2021 Canadian census, over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\" were self-reported by Canadians.[341] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5 percent), North American (22.9 percent), Asian (19.3 percent), North American Indigenous (6.1 percent), African (3.8 percent), Latin, Central and South American (2.5 percent), Caribbean (2.1 percent), Oceanian (0.3 percent), and other (6 percent).[341][342] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent of Canadians reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent.[341]\n\n\n\n![](image)The top 168 ethnic or cultural origins self-reported by Canadians in the 2021 census[343]\nThe country's ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian[d] (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent).[347]\n\n\nOf the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021, approximately 25.4 million reported being \"White\", representing 69.8 percent of the population.[348] The Indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million individuals, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021.[348] One out of every four Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority,[349][e] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1 percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7 percent), and Black (1.5 million; 4.3 percent).[351]\n\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent.[352] In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups.[353] The 2021 census indicated that 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0 percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent.[354] In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada.[355]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Canada\n\n![Map of Canada with English speakers and French speakers at a percentage](image)Approximately 98 percent of Canadians can speak either or both English and French:[356]English – 57%\nEnglish and French – 16%\nFrench – 21%\nSparsely populated area ( < 0.4 persons per km2)\n\nA multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively.[339] As of the 2021 census, just over 7.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890).[339] Canada's federal government practises official bilingualism, which is applied by the commissioner of official languages in consonance with section 16 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* and the federal *Official Languages Act*. English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.[357]\n\n\nThe 1977 *Charter of the French Language* established French as the official language of Quebec.[358] Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec.[359] New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population.[360] There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island.[361]\n\n\nOther provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.[362] There are 11 Indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.[363] Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.[364] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory.[365]\n\n\nAdditionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, some of which are Indigenous.[366] American Sign Language (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools.[367] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec.[368]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Canada\n\n![](image)Freedom of religion sculpture by Marlene Hilton Moore at the McMurtry Gardens of Justice in Toronto[369]\nCanada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs.[370] The Constitution of Canada refers to God and the monarch carries the title of *Defender of the Faith*; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism.[371] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.[372]\n\n\nRates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s.[370] With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,[373] Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state.[374][375][376] Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives,[377] they still believe in God.[378] The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter throughout Canadian society and by the state.[379]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Roman Catholics representing 29.9 percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing 53.3 percent of the population,[f] are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6 percent.[382] Other faiths include Islam (4.9 percent), Hinduism (2.3 percent), Sikhism (2.1 percent), Buddhism (1.0 percent), Judaism (0.9 percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2 percent).[383] Canada has the second-largest national Sikh population, behind India.[384]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Canada\n\nHealthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare.[385][386] It is guided by the provisions of the *Canada Health Act* of 1984[387] and is universal.[388] Universal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country.\"[389] Around 30 percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector.[390] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry.[390] Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs.[391][390]\n\n\n\n![graph of expenditures as described in the caption](image)Health expenditure and financing by country. Total health expenditure per capita in US dollars (PPP).\nIn common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years.[339] Life expectancy is 81.1 years.[392] A 2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88 percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they \"had good or very good health\".[393] Eighty percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use.[394] Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among OECD countries, contributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of diabetes.[394] Four chronic diseases—cancer (leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes—account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada.[395][396]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that healthcare spending reached $308 billion, or 12.7 percent of Canada's GDP for that year.[397] In 2022, Canada's per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the OECD.[398] Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources.[399][400] The Commonwealth Fund's 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last.[401] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage.[401] An increasing problem in Canada's health system is a lack of healthcare professionals.[402]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Canada and Higher education in Canada\n\n![The University of Toronto campus](image)University College, seen through the main gate and up King's College Road, at Canada's largest post-secondary institution, the University of Toronto\nEducation in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments.[403] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and the curriculum is overseen by the province.[404][405] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary education and post-secondary. Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada.[406] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded.[407] Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada.[408] The largest university is the University of Toronto with over 85,000 students.[409] Four universities are regularly ranked among the top 100 world-wide, namely University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, McGill University, and McMaster University, with a total of 18 universities ranked in the top 500 worldwide.[410]\n\n\nAccording to a 2019 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world;[411] the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree.[411] Canada spends about 5.3 percent of its GDP on education.[412] The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student).[413] As of 2014[update], 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.[414]\n\n\nThe mandatory education age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years,[415] contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent.[416] Just over 60,000 children are homeschooled in the country as of 2016. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading,[417][418] ranking the overall knowledge and skills of Canadian 15-year-olds as the sixth-best in the world, although these scores have been declining in recent years. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, with the average student scoring 523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493 in 2015.[419][420]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Canada\n\n![](image)*Monument to Multiculturalism* by Francesco Pirelli, in Toronto\nCanada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities and policies that promote a \"just society\" are constitutionally protected.[421][422][423] Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized equality and inclusiveness for all its people.[424][425][426] The official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments[427] and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity.[428][429] In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture.[430]\n\n\nCanada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support.[431] Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy termination) and LGBT rights, and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.[432][433][434] Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the national park system, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[435][436]\n\n\nHistorically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art, and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity.[437] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.[438]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: National symbols of Canada and Canadian royal symbols\n\n![The mother beaver sculpture outside the House of Commons](image)*The mother beaver* on the Canadian parliament's Peace Tower.[439] The five flowers on the shield each represent an ethnicity—Tudor rose: English; Fleur de lis: French; thistle: Scottish; shamrock: Irish; and leek: Welsh.\nThemes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism.[440] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, cold climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols.[441] The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the Arms of Canada.[442] Canada's official tartan, known as the \"maple leaf tartan\", has four colours that reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the seasons—green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling.[443] The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.[444]\n\n\nOther prominent symbols include the national motto, \"*A mari usque ad mare*\" (\"From Sea to Sea\"),[445] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse, the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, Canadian horse, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies,[442] and, more recently, the totem pole and Inuksuk.[446] Canadian beer, maple syrup, tuques, canoes, nanaimo bars, butter tarts, and poutine are defined as uniquely Canadian.[446][447] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, and the beaver on the nickel.[448] An image of the previous monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, appears on $20 bank notes and the obverse of all current Canadian coins.[448]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canadian literature\n\nCanadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[449] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration.[450] This progressed into three major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality.[451] In recent decades, Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from around the world.[452] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best.[453]\n\n\nNumerous Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards,[454] including novelist, poet, and literary critic Margaret Atwood, who received two Booker Prizes;[455] Nobel laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English;[456] and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who wrote the novel *The English Patient*, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.[457] L. M. Montgomery produced a series of children's novels beginning in 1908 with *Anne of Green Gables*.[458]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Canada\n\n![](image)A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) satellite truck, used for live television broadcasts\nCanada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized.[459][460] The *Broadcasting Act* declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada\".[461] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.[462] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).[463]\n\n\nCanadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a \"handful of corporations\".[464] The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French.[465] In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec.[466]\n\n\nNon-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.[467] In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing.[468] Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.[469]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canadian art\n\n![Oil on canvas painting of a tree dominating its rocky landscape during a sunset](image)*The Jack Pine* by Tom Thomson. Oil on canvas, 1916, in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada.[470]\nArt in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its Indigenous peoples,[471] and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism.[472] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.[473]\n\n\nThe Canadian government has played a role in the development of Canadian culture through the department of Canadian Heritage, by giving grants to art galleries,[474] as well as establishing and funding art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada Council for the Arts, the national public arts funder, helping artists, art galleries and periodicals, and thus contributing to the development of Canada's cultural works.[475]\n\n\nCanadian visual art has been dominated by figures, such as painter Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven.[476] The latter were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston and commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the group in 1926.[477] Associated with the group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast.[478]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Canada\n\n![](image)Original publication of \"O Canada\", 1908\nCanadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes.[479] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, and television music video channels.[480] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music.[481] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world,[482] producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles.[483] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.[484] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards.[485] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.[486]\n\n\nPatriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years. The earliest work of patriotic music in Canada, \"The Bold Canadian\", was written in 1812.[487] \"The Maple Leaf Forever\", written in 1866, was a popular patriotic song throughout English Canada and, for many years, served as an unofficial national anthem.[488] \"O Canada\" was adopted as the official anthem in 1980.[489] Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906.[490]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Canada\n\n![](image)The Canadian men's national ice hockey team celebrates shortly after winning the gold medal final at the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nThe roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s,[491] culminating in the development and popularization of the major professional games of ice hockey, lacrosse, curling, basketball, baseball, soccer, and Canadian football.[492] Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse.[493] Other sports such as golf, volleyball, skiing, cycling, swimming, badminton, tennis, bowling, and the study of martial arts are all widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.[494] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.[495] There are numerous other sport \"halls of fame\" in Canada, such as the Hockey Hall of Fame.[495]\n\n\nCanada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States.[496] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, as well as three Major League Soccer teams and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional competitions include the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League, the Canadian Premier League, and the various curling tournaments sanctioned and organized by Curling Canada.[497]\n\n\nCanada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics[498]—though, particularly, the Winter Games as a \"winter sports nation\"—and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events such as the 1976 Summer Olympics,[499] the 1988 Winter Olympics,[500] the 2010 Winter Olympics,[501][502] and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[503] Most recently, Canada hosted the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto.[504] The country is scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and the United States.[505]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Canada portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Index of Canada-related articles\n* List of Canada-related topics by provinces and territories\n* Outline of Canada\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 6,416 km (3,987 mi) via the contiguous 48 states and 2,475 km (1,538 mi) via Alaska[133]\n2. **^** \"Brokerage politics: A Canadian term for successful big tent parties that embody a pluralistic catch-all approach to appeal to the median Canadian voter ... adopting centrist policies and electoral coalitions to satisfy the short-term preferences of a majority of electors who are not located on the ideological fringe.\"[173][174] \"The traditional *brokerage* model of Canadian politics leaves little room for ideology.\"[175][176][177][178]\n3. **^**  \"The Royal Canadian Navy is composed of approximately 8,400 full-time sailors and 5,100 part-time sailors.

Respondents generally are visibly European (Anglophones and Francophones) and no longer self-identify with their ethnic ancestral origins. This response is attributed to a multitude or generational distance from ancestral lineage.\"[345][346]\n5. **^** Indigenous peoples are not considered a visible minority in Statistics Canada calculations.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world's second-largest country by total area, with the world's longest coastline. Its border with the United States is the world's longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely inhabited country of 40 million people, the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, and culminating in the *Canada Act 1982*, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nCanada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is \"called upon\" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and gender equality. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.\n\n\nA developed country, Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs, with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has had a significant influence on its global image. Canada is part of multiple major international and intergovernmental institutions.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Canada\n\nWhile a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of *Canada*, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word *kanata*, meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\".[9] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word *Canada* to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as *Canada*.[10]\n\n\nFrom the 16th to the early 18th century, \"Canada\" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These two colonies were collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12]\n\n\nUpon Confederation in 1867, *Canada* was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word *dominion* was conferred as the country's title.[13] By the 1950s, the term *Dominion of Canada* was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"realm of the Commonwealth\".[14]\n\n\nThe *Canada Act 1982*, which brought the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to *Canada*. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[15] The term *Dominion* was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term *federal* had replaced *dominion*.[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Canada\n\nFurther information: Timeline of Canadian history and Historiography of Canada\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nIndigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis,[17] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity.[17]\n\n\nThe first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.[18][19] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.[20] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.[21][22] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.[23]\n\n\n\n![Colour-coded map of North America showing the distribution of North American language families north of Mexico](image)Linguistic areas of North American Indigenous peoples at the time of European contact[24]\nThe Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000[25] and two million,[26] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.[27] As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared.[28] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity,[25][29] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.[30][31]\n\n\nAlthough not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.[32] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade.[33] These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties.[34][35] From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society.[36] These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration through state-funded boarding schools,[37] health-care segregation,[38] and displacement.[39] A period of redress began with the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.[40] This included recognition of past colonial injustices and settlement agreements and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### European colonization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of territorial claims in North America by 1750. Possessions of British America (pink), New France (blue), and New Spain (orange); California, Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin not indicated.[42]\nIt is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson.[43][44] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland.[45] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England.[46] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words, \"long live the King of France\", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I.[47] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[48] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[49][50]\n\n\nIn 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp.[51] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence.[45] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[52] Among the colonists of New France, *Canadiens* extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.[53] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.[54]\n\n\nThe English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the Thirteen Colonies to the south.[55][56] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[57] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.[58]\n\n\n\n### British North America[edit]\n\n\n![Painting of General Wolfe dying in front of the British flag while attended by officers and native allies](image)Benjamin West's *The Death of General Wolfe* (1771) dramatizes James Wolfe's death during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec.[59]\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[15] St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769.[60] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.[61] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.[62] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.[63] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.[15]\n\n\nAfter the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[64] The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city.[65] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.[66]\n\n\n\n![Painting of Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams](image)War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams[67]\nThe Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed.[68] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850.[69] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances.[70] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.[25]\n\n\nThe desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[71] The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.[15] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.[72] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[73] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–BC border.[74]\n\n\n\n### Confederation and expansion[edit]\n\n\n![Refer to caption](image)Animated map showing the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories since Confederation in 1867[75]\nFollowing three constitutional conferences, the *British North America Act, 1867* officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.[76][77] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[78] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[79] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.[80] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[80] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US.[81]\n\n\nTo open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), passed the *Dominion Lands Act* to regulate settlement and established the North-West Mounted Police to assert authority over the territory.[82][83] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to \"Indian reserves\",[84] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements.[85] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land.[86] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands.[87] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves.[88] During this time, Canada introduced the *Indian Act* extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.[89]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century[edit]\n\n\n1918 Canadian War bond posters depicting three French women pulling a plow that had been constructed for horses\n![](image)\nFrench version of the poster roughly translates as \"They serve France–Everyone can serve; Buy Victory Bonds\".\n![](image)\nThe same poster in English, with subtle differences in text. \"They serve France—How can I serve Canada?

The delay underscored Canada's independence.[91]\n\n\nThe first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the Second World War and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.[97] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[91] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany.[98]\n\n\nThe Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union.[91] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.[99]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary era[edit]\n\n\nThe financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor.[100] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.[101]\n\n\nCanada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965,[102] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[103] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[104] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.[105]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)A copy of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*[106]\nFinally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the *Canada Act 1982*, the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.[107][108][109] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own monarchy.[110][111] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.[112]\n\n\nAt the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement.[113] The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970,[114] and the sovereignist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[115] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[116][117] A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[118] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional, and the Clarity Act was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.[115]\n\n\nIn addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;[119] the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students;[120] and the Oka Crisis of 1990,[121] the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups.[122] Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United States–led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.[123] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 but declined to join the United States–led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[124]\n\n\nIn 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War[125] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[126] The country celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2017, three years before the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27, 2020, with widespread social and economic disruption.[127] In 2021, the possible graves of hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools.[128] Administered by various Christian churches and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997, these boarding schools attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.[37]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Canada\n\n![refer to caption](image)A topographic map of Canada, in polar projection (for 90° W), showing elevations shaded from green to brown (higher)\nBy total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.[129] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes.[130] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory.[131] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi).[132][133] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States—spanning 8,891 km (5,525 mi)[a]—Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island,[134] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast.[135] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.[136]\n\n\nCanada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Arctic Archipelago.[137] Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northern Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[131] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada's economic output.[131] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of which are larger than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)—containing much of the world's fresh water.[138][139] There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains, and the Arctic Cordillera.[140] Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[141]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Temperature in Canada\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification types of Canada\nAverage winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[142] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[143]\n\n\nMuch of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost. The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[144] Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[131] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[145] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity in Canada.[146]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Canada\n\n![Map showing Canada divided into different ecozones](image)Terrestrial ecozones and ecoprovinces of Canada. Ecozones are identified with a unique colour. Ecoprovinces are subdivisions of ecozones and are identified with a unique numeric code.[147]\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[148] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[149] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries,[150] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost.[151] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\".[152] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[153] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 km2 (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[154] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions,[155] with 42 percent of its land area covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land).[156]\n\n\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park established in 1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi)[158] of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes.[159] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park, established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01 sq mi). It is dominated by old-growth forest with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers.[160] Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) of lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) of islands and mainland.[161] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area, which spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45 sq mi)[162] and protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia's seabirds.[163] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves cover a total area of 235,000 square kilometres (91,000 sq mi).[164]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Canada and Politics of Canada\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Canadian Parliament Buildings and their surroundings\nCanada is described as a \"full democracy\",[165] with a tradition of liberalism,[166] and an egalitarian,[167] moderate political ideology.[168] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.[169][170] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of the Canadian government.[171][172]\n\n\nAt the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising \"brokerage politics\":[b] the centre-left leaning Liberal Party of Canada[179][180] and the centre-right leaning Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors).[181] The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale.[181] Five parties had representatives elected to the Parliament in the 2021 election—the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official Opposition; the New Democratic Party (occupying the left[182][183]); the Bloc Québécois; and the Green Party of Canada.[184] Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.[185][186][187]\n\n\nCanada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy—the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[188][189][190][191] The reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other Commonwealth countries (though, all are sovereign of one another[192]) and each of Canada's 10 provinces. To carry out most of their federal royal duties in Canada, the monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister.[193][194]\n\n\n\n![King Charles III](image)\nCharles III, King of Canada\n![Governor General Mary Simon](image)\nMary Simon, Governor General of Canada\n![Prime Minister Justin Trudeau](image)\nJustin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada\n\nThe monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada.[191][195][196] However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in certain rare crisis situations,[195] the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative) is otherwise always directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister,[197] the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House of Commons.[198] The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies.[195] The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.[199]\n\n\n\n![The House of Commons chamber](image)The House of Commons in its temporary location, the West Block[200]\nThe Parliament of Canada passes all statute laws within the federal sphere. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the Senate. While Canada inherited the British concept of parliamentary supremacy, this was later, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law.[201]\n\n\nEach of the 338 members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The *Constitution Act, 1982*, requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the *Canada Elections Act* limits this to four years with a \"fixed\" election date in October; general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in the House.[202][203] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.[204]\n\n\nCanadian federalism divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons.[196] Canada's three territories also have legislatures; but, these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.[205] The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.[206]\n\n\nThe Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country.[207] The minister of finance and minister of innovation, science, and industry use the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development.[208] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes.[209] The bank does not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.[210]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Canada\n\nThe Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions.[211] The *Constitution Act, 1867* (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments.[212] The *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, granted full autonomy, and the *Constitution Act, 1982*, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.[213] The *Charter* guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government; though, a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the *Charter* for a period of five years.[214]\n\n\n\n![Supreme Court of Canada building](image)The Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill\nCanada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since December 18, 2017, by Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of Canada.[215] The governor general appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice.[216] The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.[217]\n\n\nCommon law prevails everywhere, except in Quebec, where civil law predominates.[218] Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.[219] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.[220] In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police.[221]\n\n\nCanadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada.[222] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples.[223] Most notably, a series of 11 treaties, known as the Numbered Treaties, were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.[224] These treaties are agreements between the Canadian Crown-in-Council, with the duty to consult and accommodate.[225] The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.[223] These rights may include provision of services, such as healthcare through the Indian Health Transfer Policy, and exemption from taxation.[226]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations and military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of Canada, Canadian Armed Forces, and Military history of Canada\n\n![Canadian Delegation to the United Nations seated around conference table](image)The Canadian delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization, San Francisco, May 1945[227]\nCanada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions.[228] Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions, international organizations, and the work of numerous federal institutions.[229][230] Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image.[231][232] The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.[233]\n\n\nCanada and the United States have a long, complex, and intertwined relationship;[234][235] they are close allies, co-operating regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts.[236][237] Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France,[238] along with both countries' former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie*.[239] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.[98] Canada was a founding member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, the G20, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[228] Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs.[240] Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976.[241] The country joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001.[242] Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).[243]\n\n\nCanada's earlier strong attachment to the British Empire and, later, the Commonwealth, led it to make significant contributions to British military efforts in the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the First World War (1914–1918), and the Second World War (1939–1945).[244] Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.[245][246] During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), in cooperation with the United States, to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.[247]\n\n\n\n![A fighter jet taking off from a runway](image)A Canadian McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet in \"special markings\" used by the 2014 CF-18 Demonstration Team[248]\nDuring the Suez Crisis of 1956, future prime minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.[249] As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.[250] Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989,[91] and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere. Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia affair.[251]\n\n\nIn 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the US stabilization force and the UN-authorized, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.[252] In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925.[253]\n\n\nThe unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\"[254]—with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers.[255][c] In 2021, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.4 billion, or around 1.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).[257] Canada's total military expenditure is expected to reach $32.7 billion by 2027.[258] Canada's military currently has over 3000 personnel deployed overseas in multiple operations, such as Operation Snowgoose in Cyprus, Operation Unifier supporting Ukraine, Operation Caribbe in the Caribbean Sea, and Operation Impact, a coalition for the military intervention against ISIL.[259]\n\n\n\n### Provinces and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Provinces and territories of Canada\n\nSee also: Canadian federalism\n\n![Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces and territories](image)Political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories[260]\nCanada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories. In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (*Eastern Canada* refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[261] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and welfare,[262] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[263]\n\n\nThe major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown[264] and power and authority from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada[265] and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council,[266] rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively[267] and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment, while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.[268]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Canada\n\n![](image)The Toronto financial district is the second-largest financial centre in North America, the seventh-largest globally in employment and the heart of Canada's finance industry.[269]\nCanada has a highly developed mixed-market economy,[270][271] with the world's ninth-largest economy as of 2023[update], and a nominal GDP of approximately US$2.221 trillion.[272] It is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy.[273] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion.[274] Canada's exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States.[274] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion.[274] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion.[275]\n\n\nCanada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions.[276] It ranks low in the Corruption Perceptions Index (14th in 2023)[277] and \"is widely regarded as among the least corrupt countries of the world\".[278] It ranks high in the Global Competitiveness Report (14th in 2019)[279] and Global Innovation Index (15th in 2023).[280] Canada's economy ranks above most Western nations on The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom[281] and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity.[282] The country's average household disposable income per capita is \"well above\" the OECD average.[283] Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability[284][285] and foreign direct investment.[286][285]\n\n\nSince the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one.[287] Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce.[288] Among developed countries, Canada has an unusually important primary sector, of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent components.[289] Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby mines or sources of timber.[290]\n\n\n\n![](image)Canada\nCountries and territories with free-trade agreements[291]\n\nCanada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II.[292] The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry.[293] The Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994 (later replaced by the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement).[294] As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade agreements with 51 different countries.[291]\n\n\nCanada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.[289][295] Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas,[296] and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world.[297] The vast Athabasca oil sands and other oil reserves give Canada 13 percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world's third or fourth-largest.[298] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains.[299] The country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium.[300][301] Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.[302] The fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy.[303]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Canada\n\nIn 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9 billion on domestic research and development, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion.[304] As of 2023[update], the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine.[305] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index,[306] and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms.[307] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population.[308]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Canadian-built Space Shuttle robotic arm (left), referred to as Canadarm, transferred the P5 truss segment over to the Canadian-built space station robotic arm, referred to as Canadarm2.[309]\nCanada's developments in science and technology include the creation of the modern alkaline battery,[310] the discovery of insulin,[311] the development of the polio vaccine,[312] and discoveries about the interior structure of the atomic nucleus.[313] Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial cardiac pacemaker, mapping the visual cortex,[314][315] the development of the electron microscope,[316][317] plate tectonics, deep learning, multi-touch technology, and the identification of the first black hole, Cygnus X-1.[318] Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include stem cells, site-directed mutagenesis, T-cell receptor, and the identification of the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases.[315][319]\n\n\nThe Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research and developing rockets and satellites.[320] Canada was the third country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch.[321] Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2, Canadarm3 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle.[322] Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS, and MOST.[323] Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant.[324]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Canada and List of cities in Canada\n\n![](image)Canada population density map (2014)[325]\nThe 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure.[326] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023.[327] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.[328] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[329] driven mainly by economic policy and also family reunification.[330][331] A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted to Canada in 2021.[332] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 28,000 in 2018.[333] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas in the country, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[334]\n\n\nCanada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world.[326] Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north and approximately 95 percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north.[335] About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the border with the contiguous United States.[336] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living urban centres.[337] The most densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[338][335]\n\n\nThe majority of Canadians (81.1 percent) live in family households, 12.1 percent report living alone, and those living with other relatives or unrelated persons reported at 6.8 percent.[339] Fifty-one percent of households are couples with or without children, 8.7 percent are single-parent households, 2.9 percent are multigenerational households, and 29.3 percent are single-person households.[339]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in Canada2021 Canadian census[340]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |\n| 1 | Toronto | Ontario | 6,202,225 | 11 | London | Ontario | 543,551\n |\n| 2 | Montreal | Quebec | 4,291,732 | 12 | Halifax | Nova Scotia | 465,703\n |\n| 3 | Vancouver | British Columbia | 2,642,825 | 13 | Niagara Region | Ontario | 433,604\n |\n| 4 | Ottawa–Gatineau | Ontario–Quebec | 1,488,307 | 14 | Windsor | Ontario | 422,630\n |\n| 5 | Calgary | Alberta | 1,481,806 | 15 | Oshawa | Ontario | 415,311\n |\n| 6 | Edmonton | Alberta | 1,418,118 | 16 | Victoria | British Columbia | 397,237\n |\n| 7 | Quebec City | Quebec | 839,311 | 17 | Saskatoon | Saskatchewan | 317,480\n |\n| 8 | Winnipeg | Manitoba | 834,678 | 18 | Regina | Saskatchewan | 249,217\n |\n| 9 | Hamilton | Ontario | 785,184 | 19 | Sherbrooke | Quebec | 227,398\n |\n| 10 | Waterloo Region | Ontario | 575,847 | 20 | Kelowna | British Columbia | 222,162\n |\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic origins of people in Canada\n\nAccording to the 2021 Canadian census, over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\" were self-reported by Canadians.[341] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5 percent), North American (22.9 percent), Asian (19.3 percent), North American Indigenous (6.1 percent), African (3.8 percent), Latin, Central and South American (2.5 percent), Caribbean (2.1 percent), Oceanian (0.3 percent), and other (6 percent).[341][342] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent of Canadians reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent.[341]\n\n\n\n![](image)The top 168 ethnic or cultural origins self-reported by Canadians in the 2021 census[343]\nThe country's ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian[d] (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent).[347]\n\n\nOf the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021, approximately 25.4 million reported being \"White\", representing 69.8 percent of the population.[348] The Indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million individuals, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021.[348] One out of every four Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority,[349][e] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1 percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7 percent), and Black (1.5 million; 4.3 percent).[351]\n\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent.[352] In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups.[353] The 2021 census indicated that 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0 percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent.[354] In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada.[355]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Canada\n\n![Map of Canada with English speakers and French speakers at a percentage](image)Approximately 98 percent of Canadians can speak either or both English and French:[356]English – 57%\nEnglish and French – 16%\nFrench – 21%\nSparsely populated area ( < 0.4 persons per km2)\n\nA multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively.[339] As of the 2021 census, just over 7.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890).[339] Canada's federal government practises official bilingualism, which is applied by the commissioner of official languages in consonance with section 16 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* and the federal *Official Languages Act*. English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.[357]\n\n\nThe 1977 *Charter of the French Language* established French as the official language of Quebec.[358] Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec.[359] New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population.[360] There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island.[361]\n\n\nOther provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.[362] There are 11 Indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.[363] Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.[364] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory.[365]\n\n\nAdditionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, some of which are Indigenous.[366] American Sign Language (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools.[367] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec.[368]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Canada\n\n![](image)Freedom of religion sculpture by Marlene Hilton Moore at the McMurtry Gardens of Justice in Toronto[369]\nCanada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs.[370] The Constitution of Canada refers to God and the monarch carries the title of *Defender of the Faith*; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism.[371] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.[372]\n\n\nRates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s.[370] With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,[373] Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state.[374][375][376] Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives,[377] they still believe in God.[378] The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter throughout Canadian society and by the state.[379]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Roman Catholics representing 29.9 percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing 53.3 percent of the population,[f] are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6 percent.[382] Other faiths include Islam (4.9 percent), Hinduism (2.3 percent), Sikhism (2.1 percent), Buddhism (1.0 percent), Judaism (0.9 percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2 percent).[383] Canada has the second-largest national Sikh population, behind India.[384]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Canada\n\nHealthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare.[385][386] It is guided by the provisions of the *Canada Health Act* of 1984[387] and is universal.[388] Universal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country.\"[389] Around 30 percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector.[390] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry.[390] Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs.[391][390]\n\n\n\n![graph of expenditures as described in the caption](image)Health expenditure and financing by country. Total health expenditure per capita in US dollars (PPP).\nIn common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years.[339] Life expectancy is 81.1 years.[392] A 2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88 percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they \"had good or very good health\".[393] Eighty percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use.[394] Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among OECD countries, contributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of diabetes.[394] Four chronic diseases—cancer (leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes—account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada.[395][396]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that healthcare spending reached $308 billion, or 12.7 percent of Canada's GDP for that year.[397] In 2022, Canada's per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the OECD.[398] Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources.[399][400] The Commonwealth Fund's 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last.[401] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage.[401] An increasing problem in Canada's health system is a lack of healthcare professionals.[402]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Canada and Higher education in Canada\n\n![The University of Toronto campus](image)University College, seen through the main gate and up King's College Road, at Canada's largest post-secondary institution, the University of Toronto\nEducation in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments.[403] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and the curriculum is overseen by the province.[404][405] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary education and post-secondary. Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada.[406] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded.[407] Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada.[408] The largest university is the University of Toronto with over 85,000 students.[409] Four universities are regularly ranked among the top 100 world-wide, namely University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, McGill University, and McMaster University, with a total of 18 universities ranked in the top 500 worldwide.[410]\n\n\nAccording to a 2019 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world;[411] the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree.[411] Canada spends about 5.3 percent of its GDP on education.[412] The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student).[413] As of 2014[update], 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.[414]\n\n\nThe mandatory education age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years,[415] contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent.[416] Just over 60,000 children are homeschooled in the country as of 2016. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading,[417][418] ranking the overall knowledge and skills of Canadian 15-year-olds as the sixth-best in the world, although these scores have been declining in recent years. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, with the average student scoring 523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493 in 2015.[419][420]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Canada\n\n![](image)*Monument to Multiculturalism* by Francesco Pirelli, in Toronto\nCanada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities and policies that promote a \"just society\" are constitutionally protected.[421][422][423] Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized equality and inclusiveness for all its people.[424][425][426] The official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments[427] and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity.[428][429] In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture.[430]\n\n\nCanada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support.[431] Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy termination) and LGBT rights, and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.[432][433][434] Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the national park system, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[435][436]\n\n\nHistorically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art, and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity.[437] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.[438]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: National symbols of Canada and Canadian royal symbols\n\n![The mother beaver sculpture outside the House of Commons](image)*The mother beaver* on the Canadian parliament's Peace Tower.[439] The five flowers on the shield each represent an ethnicity—Tudor rose: English; Fleur de lis: French; thistle: Scottish; shamrock: Irish; and leek: Welsh.\nThemes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism.[440] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, cold climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols.[441] The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the Arms of Canada.[442] Canada's official tartan, known as the \"maple leaf tartan\", has four colours that reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the seasons—green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling.[443] The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.[444]\n\n\nOther prominent symbols include the national motto, \"*A mari usque ad mare*\" (\"From Sea to Sea\"),[445] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse, the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, Canadian horse, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies,[442] and, more recently, the totem pole and Inuksuk.[446] Canadian beer, maple syrup, tuques, canoes, nanaimo bars, butter tarts, and poutine are defined as uniquely Canadian.[446][447] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, and the beaver on the nickel.[448] An image of the previous monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, appears on $20 bank notes and the obverse of all current Canadian coins.[448]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canadian literature\n\nCanadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[449] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration.[450] This progressed into three major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality.[451] In recent decades, Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from around the world.[452] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best.[453]\n\n\nNumerous Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards,[454] including novelist, poet, and literary critic Margaret Atwood, who received two Booker Prizes;[455] Nobel laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English;[456] and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who wrote the novel *The English Patient*, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.[457] L. M. Montgomery produced a series of children's novels beginning in 1908 with *Anne of Green Gables*.[458]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Canada\n\n![](image)A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) satellite truck, used for live television broadcasts\nCanada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized.[459][460] The *Broadcasting Act* declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada\".[461] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.[462] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).[463]\n\n\nCanadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a \"handful of corporations\".[464] The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French.[465] In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec.[466]\n\n\nNon-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.[467] In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing.[468] Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.[469]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canadian art\n\n![Oil on canvas painting of a tree dominating its rocky landscape during a sunset](image)*The Jack Pine* by Tom Thomson. Oil on canvas, 1916, in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada.[470]\nArt in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its Indigenous peoples,[471] and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism.[472] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.[473]\n\n\nThe Canadian government has played a role in the development of Canadian culture through the department of Canadian Heritage, by giving grants to art galleries,[474] as well as establishing and funding art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada Council for the Arts, the national public arts funder, helping artists, art galleries and periodicals, and thus contributing to the development of Canada's cultural works.[475]\n\n\nCanadian visual art has been dominated by figures, such as painter Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven.[476] The latter were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston and commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the group in 1926.[477] Associated with the group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast.[478]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Canada\n\n![](image)Original publication of \"O Canada\", 1908\nCanadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes.[479] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, and television music video channels.[480] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music.[481] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world,[482] producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles.[483] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.[484] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards.[485] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.[486]\n\n\nPatriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years. The earliest work of patriotic music in Canada, \"The Bold Canadian\", was written in 1812.[487] \"The Maple Leaf Forever\", written in 1866, was a popular patriotic song throughout English Canada and, for many years, served as an unofficial national anthem.[488] \"O Canada\" was adopted as the official anthem in 1980.[489] Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906.[490]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Canada\n\n![](image)The Canadian men's national ice hockey team celebrates shortly after winning the gold medal final at the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nThe roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s,[491] culminating in the development and popularization of the major professional games of ice hockey, lacrosse, curling, basketball, baseball, soccer, and Canadian football.[492] Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse.[493] Other sports such as golf, volleyball, skiing, cycling, swimming, badminton, tennis, bowling, and the study of martial arts are all widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.[494] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.[495] There are numerous other sport \"halls of fame\" in Canada, such as the Hockey Hall of Fame.[495]\n\n\nCanada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States.[496] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, as well as three Major League Soccer teams and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional competitions include the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League, the Canadian Premier League, and the various curling tournaments sanctioned and organized by Curling Canada.[497]\n\n\nCanada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics[498]—though, particularly, the Winter Games as a \"winter sports nation\"—and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events such as the 1976 Summer Olympics,[499] the 1988 Winter Olympics,[500] the 2010 Winter Olympics,[501][502] and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[503] Most recently, Canada hosted the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto.[504] The country is scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and the United States.[505]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Canada portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Index of Canada-related articles\n* List of Canada-related topics by provinces and territories\n* Outline of Canada\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 6,416 km (3,987 mi) via the contiguous 48 states and 2,475 km (1,538 mi) via Alaska[133]\n2. **^** \"Brokerage politics: A Canadian term for successful big tent parties that embody a pluralistic catch-all approach to appeal to the median Canadian voter ... adopting centrist policies and electoral coalitions to satisfy the short-term preferences of a majority of electors who are not located on the ideological fringe.\"[173][174] \"The traditional *brokerage* model of Canadian politics leaves little room for ideology.\"[175][176][177][178]\n3. **^**  \"The Royal Canadian Navy is composed of approximately 8,400 full-time sailors and 5,100 part-time sailors.

Respondents generally are visibly European (Anglophones and Francophones) and no longer self-identify with their ethnic ancestral origins. This response is attributed to a multitude or generational distance from ancestral lineage.\"[345][346]\n5. **^** Indigenous peoples are not considered a visible minority in Statistics Canada calculations.

The World Factbook reports the total as 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi).\n |\n\n\n**France** (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ⓘ), officially the **French Republic** (French: *République française* [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛːz]),[14] is a country located primarily in Western Europe. It also includes overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans,[XII] giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the north east, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the south east, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the north west. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and have a total population of over 68 million as of January 2023[update].[5][8] France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Nice.\n\n\nMetropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Germanic Franks formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, the French Renaissance saw culture flourish and a French colonial empire rise.[15] Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.[16]\n\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars significantly shaped the course of European history. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allied powers of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied by the Axis in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.\n\n\nFrance retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science and philosophy. It hosts the fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018.[17] France is a developed country with a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world. It is a great power in global affairs,[18] being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the eurozone,[19] as well as a key member of the Group of Seven, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Francophonie.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and pronunciation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of France\n\nOriginally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name *France* comes from the Latin *Francia*, or \"realm of the Franks\".[20] Modern France is still named today *Francia* in Italian and Spanish, while *Frankreich* in German, *Frankrijk* in Dutch and *Frankrike* in Swedish and Norwegian all mean \"Land/realm of the Franks\".\n\n\nThe name of the Franks is related to the English word *frank* (\"free\"): the latter stems from the Old French *franc* (\"free, noble, sincere\"), ultimately from Medieval Latin *francus* (\"free, exempt from service; freeman, Frank\"), a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as a Late Latin borrowing of the reconstructed Frankish endonym \\**Frank*.[21][22] It has been suggested that the meaning \"free\" was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation,[23] or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves.[22]\n\n\nThe etymology of *\\*Frank* is uncertain. It is traditionally derived from the Proto-Germanic word \\**frankōn*, which translates as \"javelin\" or \"lance\" (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the *francisca*),[24] although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.[22]\n\n\nIn English, 'France' is pronounced /fræns/ *FRANSS* in American English and /frɑːns/ *FRAHNSS* or /fræns/ *FRANSS* in British English. The pronunciation with /ɑː/ is mostly confined to accents with the trap-bath split such as Received Pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as Cardiff English, in which /frɑːns/ is in free variation with /fræns/.[25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of France\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of French history.\n\n### Prehistory (before the 6th century BC)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistory of France\n\nThe oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.[26] Neanderthals occupied the region into the Upper Paleolithic era but were slowly replaced by *Homo sapiens* around 35,000 BCE.[27] This period witnessed the emergence of cave painting in the Dordogne and the Pyrenees, including at the famous Lascaux site, dated to c. 18,000 BC.[26] At the end of the Last Glacial Period (10,000 BC), the climate became milder;[26] from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era, and its inhabitants became sedentary.\n\n\nAfter strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, initially working gold, copper and bronze, then later iron.[28] France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic, including the exceptionally dense Carnac stones site (approximately 3,300 BC).\n\n\n\n### Antiquity (6th century BC – 5th century AD)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Gaul, Celts, and Roman Gaul\n\nIn 600 BC, Ionian Greeks from Phocaea founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This makes it France's oldest city.[29] At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern France, gradually spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC.[30]\n\n\n\n![Maison Carrée temple in Nemausus Corinthian columns and portico](image)The Maison Carrée was a temple of the Gallo-Roman city of Nemausus (present-day Nîmes) and is one of the best-preserved vestiges of the Roman Empire.\nAround 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Roman Italy through the Alps, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome.[31] The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome.[32] But the Romans and the Gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries, and the Gauls would continue to be a threat in Italy.[33]\n\n\nAround 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region *Provincia Nostra* (\"Our Province\"), which over time evolved into the name Provence in French.[34] Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC.[35] Gaul was divided by Augustus into Roman provinces.[36] Many cities were founded during the Gallo-Roman period, including Lugdunum (present-day Lyon), which is considered the capital of the Gauls.[36]\n\n\nFrom the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians.[37] Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.[38] In 312, Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity. Subsequently, Christians who had been persecuted increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire.[39] But from the beginning of the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed.[40] Teutonic tribes invaded the region from present-day Germany, the Visigoths settling in the southwest, the Burgundians along the Rhine River Valley, and the Franks in the north.[41]\n\n\n\n### Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Francia, Merovingian dynasty, and Carolingian dynasty\n\nSee also: List of French monarchs and France in the Middle Ages\n\nAt the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled in the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived, and independent petty kingdoms arose in the region.\n\n\nThe first leader to unite all Franks was Clovis I, who began his reign as king of the Salian Franks in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors of the province in 486. Clovis claimed that he would be baptised a Christian in the event of his victory against the Visigothic Kingdom, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis regained the southwest from the Visigoths, was baptised in 508 and made himself master of what is now western Germany.\n\n\nClovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title \"Eldest daughter of the Church\" (*French: *La fille aînée de l'Église**) by the papacy,[42] and French kings would be called \"the Most Christian Kings of France\" (**Rex Christianissimus**).\n\n\n\n![painting of Clovis I conversion to Catholicism in 498, a king being baptised in a tub in a cathedral surrounded by bishop and monks](image)With Clovis's conversion to Catholicism in 498, the Frankish monarchy, elective and secular until then, became hereditary and of divine right.\nThe Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture, and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed *Francia* (\"Land of the Franks\"). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages, except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Umayyad invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe.\n\n\nProclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church,[43] Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son, Louis I (r. 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald. West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was its precursor.[44]\n\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by Viking invasions, France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added \"King of England\" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions.\n\n\n\n### High and Late Middle Ages (10th–15th century)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: France in the Middle Ages\n\n![](image)Joan of Arc led the French Army to several important victories during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), which paved the way for the final victory.\nThe Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned king of the Franks.[45] This date is often used as the transtition between West Francia and the Kingdom of France. His descendants—the direct Capetians, the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon—progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance. Starting from 1190, during the reign of Philip II, the Capetian rulers began to be referred as \"kings of France\" (*rex Francie*) rather than \"kings of the Franks\" (*rex Francorum*).[46] Later kings would expand their directly possessed *domaine royal* to cover over half of modern continental France by the 15th century, including most of the north, centre and west of France. During this process, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners.\n\n\nThe French nobility played a prominent role in most Crusades to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the 200-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as *Franj* caring little whether they came from France.[47] The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the *lingua franca* (lit. \"Frankish language\") of the Crusader states.[47] French knights also made up the majority in both the Hospital and the Temple orders. The latter in particular held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, until Philip IV annihilated the order in 1307. The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of France.[48]\n\n\nFrom the 11th century, the House of Plantagenet, the rulers of the County of Anjou, succeeded in establishing its dominion over the surrounding provinces of Maine and Touraine, then progressively built an \"empire\" that spanned from England to the Pyrenees and covering half of modern France. Tensions between the kingdom of France and the Plantagenet empire would last a hundred years, until Philip II of France conquered, between 1202 and 1214, most of the continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and Aquitaine to the Plantagenets.\n\n\nCharles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.[49] Under Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.[49] Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, rather than through the female line to Edward of Plantagenet, who would soon become Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.[49] However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-on Hundred Years' War.[50] The boundaries changed greatly with time, but landholdings inside France by the English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, strong French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death, from which half of the 17 million population of France died.[51]\n\n\n\n### Early modern period (15th century–1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ancien Régime and France in the early modern period\n\nThe French Renaissance saw spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as the Italian Wars, between France and the House of Habsburg. French explorers such as Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.[52] The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. Spanish troops, the terror of Western Europe,[53] assisted the Catholic side from 1589 to 1594 and invaded northern France in 1597; after some skirmishing in the 1620s and 1630s, Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The war cost France 300,000 casualties.[54]\n\n\nUnder Louis XIII, Cardinal Richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s. He systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence (duelling, carrying weapons and maintaining private armies). By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established \"the royal monopoly of force\" as the doctrine.[55]\n\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th century, France was responsible for 11% of the transatlantic slave trade,[56] second only to Great Britain during the 18th century.[57] While the state began condoning the practice with letters patent in the 1630s, Louis XIII only formalized this authorization more generally in 1642 in the last year of his reign. By the mid-18th century, Nantes had become the principal French slave-trading port.[56]\n\n\n\n![Louis XIV of France standing in plate armour and blue sash facing left holding baton](image)Louis XIV, the \"Sun King\", was the absolute monarch of France and made France the leading European power.During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in France. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, his command of the military went unchallenged. Remembered for numerous wars, the so-called \"Sun King\" made France the leading European power. France became the most populous country in Europe and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.[58] During his reign, France took colonial control of many overseas territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. In 1685, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published the *Code Noir* providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jewish people from the French colonies.[59]\n\n\nUnder the wars of Louis XV (r. 1715–1774), France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). Its European territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions—as well as the decadence of his court—discredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for the French Revolution 15 years after his death.[60]\n\n\nLouis XVI (r. 1774–1793) actively supported the Americans with money, fleets and armies, helping them win independence from Great Britain. France gained revenge but spent so heavily that the government verged on bankruptcy—a factor that contributed to the French Revolution. Some of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the naming of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source of legitimacy, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and also was a factor in the French Revolution.\n\n\n\n### Revolutionary France (1789–1799)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of France § Revolutionary France (1789–1799)\n\n![drawing of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, smoke of gunfire enveloping stone castle](image)The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the French Revolution.\nFacing financial troubles, Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General (gathering the three Estates of the realm) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estate formed a National Assembly, signalling the outbreak of the French Revolution. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents stormed the Bastille on 14 July 1789, a date which would become France's National Day.\n\n\nIn early August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights. Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (27 August 1789), France established fundamental rights for men. The declaration affirms \"the natural and imprescriptible rights of man\" to \"liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression\". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests were outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth. In November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalise and sell all property of the Catholic Church which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a Civil Constitution of the Clergy reorganised the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes in June 1791 seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.\n\n\nIn the August 1791 Declaration of Pillnitz, the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia threatened to restore the French monarch by force. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced Louis XVI to accept the French Constitution of 1791, thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. In the newly established Legislative Assembly (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group later called the 'Girondins', who favoured war with Austria and Prussia, and a group later called 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins' who opposed such a war. A majority in the Assembly in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government and thought that such a war could be won and so declared war on Austria on 20 April 1792.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Le Serment du Jeu de paume* by Jacques-Louis David, 1791\nOn 10 August 1792, an angry crowd threatened the palace of Louis XVI, who took refuge in the Legislative Assembly.[61][62] A Prussian army invaded France later in August 1792. In early September, Parisians, infuriated by the Prussian Army capturing Verdun and counter-revolutionary uprisings in the west of France, murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners by raiding the Parisian prisons. The Assembly and the Paris City Council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed.[61][63] The National Convention, chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage,[61] on 20 September 1792 succeeded the Legislative Assembly and on 21 September abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the French First Republic. Louis XVI was convicted of treason and guillotined in January 1793. France had declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria and Prussia invaded France; in March, France created a \"sister republic\" in the \"Republic of Mainz\" and kept it under control.\n\n\nAlso in March 1793, a counter-revolution in Vendée began, evoked by both the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 and the nationwide army conscription in early 1793; elsewhere in France rebellion was brewing too. A factionalist feud in the National Convention, smouldering ever since October 1791, came to a climax on 2 June 1793 with the group of the Girondins being forced to resign and leave the convention. By July the counter-revolution had spread to Brittany, Normandy, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, and Lyon. Between October and December 1793, Paris' Convention government took brutal measures to subdue most internal uprisings at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives.[64] By the end of 1793, the allies had been driven from France. \n\n\nPolitical disagreements and enmity in the National Convention reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. Meanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were prospering, for example in Belgium. In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food. Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and royalism.\n\n\n\n### Napoleon and 19th century (1799–1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of France § Napoleonic France (1799–1815); and History of France § Long 19th century, 1815–1914\n\nSee also: France in the long nineteenth century and History of France (1900–present)\n\n![painting of Napoleon in 1806 standing with hand in vest attended by staff and Imperial guard regiment](image)Napoleon, Emperor of the French, built a vast empire across Europe.[65]\nGeneral Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the French Revolutionary Wars, changing sets of European coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt and Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.[66]\n\n\nThese victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. In June 1812 Napoleon attacked Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After the catastrophic Russian campaign and the ensuing uprising of European monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.[66] After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, and the Bourbon monarchy was restored with new constitutional limitations.\n\n\nThe discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy. In that year, French troops began the conquest of Algeria, establishing the first colonial presence in Africa since Napoleon's abortive invasion of Egypt in 1798. In 1848, general unrest led to the February Revolution and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage, which were briefly enacted during the French Revolution, was re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the president of the French Republic, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the Second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, Mexico and Italy which resulted in the annexation of the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and his regime was replaced by the Third Republic. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete, with approximately 825,000 Algerians killed from famine, disease, and violence.[67]\n\n\n\n![](image)The first (light blue) and second (dark blue) French colonial empire\nFrance had colonial possessions, in various forms since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second-largest in the world behind the British Empire.[15] Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under French sovereignty reached almost 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land. Known as the *Belle Époque*, the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, state secularism was officially established.\n\n\n\n### Early to mid-20th century (1914–1946)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of France (1900–present)\n\nFrance was invaded by Germany and defended by Great Britain to start World War I in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the northeast was occupied. France and the Allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at a tremendous human and material cost. World War I left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population.[68] Between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912 to 1915 were killed.[69] The interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (e.g., annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government).\n\n\n\n![](image)French Poilus posing with their war-torn flag in 1917, during World War IIn 1940, France was invaded and quickly defeated by Nazi Germany. France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north, an Italian occupation zone in the southeast and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of the southern French metropolitan territory (two-fifths of pre-war metropolitan France) and the French empire (including French Tunisia, French Morocco, and French Algeria); the Vichy government, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory. Free France, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London.[70]\n\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews,[71] were deported to death camps and concentration camps in Germany and occupied Poland.[72] In September 1943, Corsica was the first French metropolitan territory to liberate itself from the Axis powers. On 6 June 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy, and in August they invaded Provence. Over the following year, the Allies and the French Resistance emerged victorious, and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It also made several important reforms (e.g., suffrage extended to women and the creation of a social security system).\n\n\n\n### Contemporary period (1946–present)[edit]\n\n\n![Charles de Gaulle seated in uniform looking left with folded arms](image)Charles de Gaulle, a hero of World War I, leader of the Free French during World War II, and President of France\nThe GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the Fourth Republic (1946–1958), which saw spectacular economic growth (*les Trente Glorieuses*). France was one of the founding members of NATO. France attempted to regain control of French Indochina but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954 at the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria, then treated as an integral part of France and home to over one million European settlers (Pied-Noir). During the conflict, the French systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control of Algeria.[73] This conflict wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war in France.[74]\n\n\nDuring the May 1958 crisis, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened presidency.[75] In the latter role, de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the Algerian War. The war was concluded with the Évian Accords in 1962 which led to Algerian independence. Algerian independence came at a high price: it resulted in between half a million and one million deaths and over 2 million internally displaced Algerians.[76] Around one million Pied-Noirs and Harkis fled from Algeria to France upon independence.[77] A vestige of the colonial empire are the French overseas departments and territories.\n\n\nIn the context of the Cold War, de Gaulle pursued a policy of \"national independence\" towards the Western and Eastern blocs. To this end, he withdrew from NATO's military-integrated command (while remaining within the NATO alliance), launched a nuclear development programme and made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring a Europe of sovereign nations. In the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968, the revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact. It was the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (as the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle, who resigned shortly after.[78]\n\n\nIn the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed economies in the world but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational European Union, notably by signing the Maastricht Treaty (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the eurozone in 1999 and signing the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007.[79] France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO-sponsored wars.[80]\n\n\n\n![Place de la République statue column with large French flag](image)Republican marches were organised across France after the January 2015 attacks perpetrated by Islamist terrorists; they became the largest public rallies in French history.\nSince the 19th century, France has received many immigrants. These have been mostly male foreign workers from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed.[81] During the 1970s France faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the Maghreb)[81] to permanently settle in France with their families and acquire French citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims (especially in the larger cities) living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates.[82] Simultaneously France renounced the assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French traditional values and cultural norms. They were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate.[83]\n\n\nSince the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings, France has been sporadically targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the *Charlie Hebdo* attack in January 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in French history, gathering 4.4 million people,[84] the November 2015 Paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II[85] and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004,[86] as well as the 2016 Nice truck attack, which caused 87 deaths during Bastille Day celebrations. Opération Chammal, France's military efforts to contain ISIS, killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.[87]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of France\n\n### Location and borders[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chamonix valley with the Mont Blanc at background, the highest mountain in the Alps and Western Europe on the border with Italy\nThe vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called Metropolitan France, to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. Except for the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as **l'Hexagone** (\"The Hexagon\"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° N, and longitudes 6° W and 10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west.\n\n\nMetropolitan France covers 551,500 square kilometres (212,935 sq mi),[88] the largest among European Union members.[19] France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding Adélie Land), is 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi), 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south-central and Pyrenees in the southwest.\n\n\nDue to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2 (4,261,000 sq mi), just behind the EEZ of the United States, which covers 11,351,000 km2 (4,383,000 sq mi), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia, which covers 8,148,250 km2 (3,146,000 sq mi). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world.\n\n\n\n### Geology, topography and hydrography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Geological formations near Roussillon, Vaucluse\nMetropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône Valley, allow easy communication. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft)[89] above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate.\n\n\nThe coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the Côte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[90] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders. France has 11 million square kilometres (4.2×10~~^~~6 sq mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of national parks of France, Regional natural parks of France, and Climate change in France\n\nFrance was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in 1971.[91] Although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world, France is ranked only 19th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as Canada or Australia. This is due to the country's heavy investment in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis,[92] which now accounts for 75 per cent of its electricity production[93] and results in less pollution.[94][95] According to the 2020 Environmental Performance Index conducted by Yale and Columbia, France was the fifth most environmentally conscious country in the world (behind the United Kingdom).[96][97]\n\n\nLike all European Union state members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by 2020,[98] compared to the United States' plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels.[99] As of 2009[update], French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China.[100] The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted,[101] which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually.[102] However, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses.[103]\n\n\nForests account for 31 per cent of France's land area—the fourth-highest proportion in Europe—representing an increase of 7 per cent since 1990.[104][105][106] French forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees.[107] France had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.52/10, ranking it 123rd globally out of 172 countries.[108] There are nine national parks[109] and 46 natural parks in France,[110] with the government planning to convert 20% of its exclusive economic zone into a Marine protected area by 2020.[111] A regional nature park[112] (French: *parc naturel régional* or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area.[113] A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage. The parks foster ecological research programmes and public education in the natural sciences.[114] As of 2019[update] there are 54 PNRs in France.[115]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of France\n\nThe French Republic is divided into 18 regions (located in Europe and overseas), five overseas collectivities, one overseas territory, one special collectivity – New Caledonia and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France – Clipperton.\n\n\n\n#### Regions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Departments of France\n\n![](image) Hauts-de-  \nFrance\n\nNormandy\n\nÎle-de-  \nFrance\n\nGrand Est\n\nBourgogne-  \nFranche-  \nComté\n\nCentre-  \nVal de Loire\n\nPays de   \nla Loire\n\nBrittany\n\nNouvelle-  \nAquitaine\n\nAuvergne-  \nRhône-Alpes\n\nOccitania\n\nProvence-  \nAlpes-  \nCôte d'Azur\n\nCorsica\n\nFrench Guiana\n\nGuadeloupe\n\nMartinique\n\nMayotte\n\nRéunion\n*Belgium*\n\n*Luxembourg*\n\n*Germany*\n\n*Switzerland*\n\n*Liechtenstein*\n\n*Italy*\n\n*Monaco*\n\n*United Kingdom*\n\n*Andorra*\n\n*Brazil*\n\n*Suriname*\n\n*Spain*\n*Channel*\n\n*Bay of  \nBiscay*\n\n*Ligurian  \nSea*\n\n*Mediterranean  \nSea*\n\nSince 2016, France is divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in metropolitan France (including Corsica),[116] and five overseas.[88] The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments,[117] which are numbered mainly alphabetically. The department number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle registration plates. Among the 101 French departments, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs), enjoying the same status as metropolitan departments and are thereby included in the European Union.\n\n\nThe 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons.[118] These cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.[118] Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements.\n\n\n\n#### Overseas territories and collectivities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Overseas France\n\nFurther information: Overseas collectivity and Overseas territory (France)\nIn addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna), one *sui generis* collectivity (New Caledonia), one overseas territory (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island). Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (except for St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc[119] whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.[120]\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of France\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nCurrent leaders\n![](image)\nEmmanuel Macron  \nPresident\n![](image)\nÉlisabeth Borne  \nPrime Minister\n\nFrance is a representative democracy organised as a unitary, semi-presidential republic.[121] As one of the earliest republics of the modern world, democratic traditions and values are deeply rooted in French culture, identity and politics.[122] The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958, establishing a framework consisting of executive, legislative and judicial branches.[123] It sought to address the instability of the Third and Fourth Republics by combining elements of both parliamentary and presidential systems, while greatly strengthening the authority of the executive relative to the legislature.[122]\n\n\nThe executive branch has two leaders. The President of the Republic, currently Emmanuel Macron, is the head of state, elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a five-year term.[124] The Prime Minister, currently Élisabeth Borne, is the head of government, appointed by the President to lead the government. The President has the power to dissolve Parliament or circumvent it by submitting referendums directly to the people; the President also appoints judges and civil servants, negotiates and ratifies international agreements, as well as serves as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. The Prime Minister determines public policy and oversees the civil service, with an emphasis on domestic matters.[125] In the 2022 presidential election, president Macron was re-elected.[126] 2 months later, in the June 2022 legislative elections, Macron lost his parliamentary majority and had to form a minority government.[127]\n\n\n\n![](image)Palais Bourbon, the meeting place of the National Assembly, the lower legislative chamber of the French Parliament\nThe legislature consists of the French Parliament, a bicameral body made up of a lower house, the National Assembly (*Assemblée nationale*) and an upper house, the Senate.[128] Legislators in the National Assembly, known as *députés*, represent local constituencies and are directly elected for five-year terms.[129] The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government by majority vote. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for six-year terms, with half the seats submitted to election every three years.[130] The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.[131] The parliament is responsible for determining the rules and principles concerning most areas of law, political amnesty, and fiscal policy; however, the government may draft specific details concerning most laws.\n\n\nUntil World War II, Radicals were a strong political force in France, embodied by the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party which was the most important party of the Third Republic. From World War II until 2017, French politics was dominated by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, the French Section of the Workers' International, which was succeeded by the Socialist Party (in 1969); and the other right-wing, the Gaullist Party, whose name changed over time to the Rally of the French People (1947), the Union of Democrats for the Republic (1958), the Rally for the Republic (1976), the Union for a Popular Movement (2007) and The Republicans (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, the radical centrist party La République En Marche! (LREM) became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans. LREM's opponent in the second round of the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections was the growing far-right party National Rally (RN). Since 2020, Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV) have performed well in mayoral elections in major cities[132] while on a national level, an alliance of Left parties (the NUPES) was the second-largest voting block elected to the lower house in 2022.[133] Additionally, right-wing populist RN became the largest opposition party in the National Assembly in 2022.[134]\n\n\nThe electorate is constitutionally empowered to vote on amendments passed by the Parliament and bills submitted by the president. Referendums have played a key role in shaping French politics and even foreign policy; voters have decided on such matters as Algeria's independence, the election of the president by popular vote, the formation of the EU, and the reduction of presidential term limits.[135]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of France\n\nFrance uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes;[88] judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law in a common law system). Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation wrote about the management of prisons: \"Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.\" That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.\n\n\n\n![color drawing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from 1789](image)The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\nFrench law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law. Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal *ex post facto* laws are prohibited).[136] While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State. To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the *Journal officiel de la République française*.\n\n\nFrance does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions; it has long abolished blasphemy laws and sodomy laws (the latter in 1791). However, \"offences against public decency\" (*contraires aux bonnes mœurs*) or disturbing public order (*trouble à l'ordre public*) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution.\n\n\nFrance generally has a positive reputation regarding LGBT rights.[137] Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples have been permitted, and since 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal.[138] Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881. Some consider hate speech laws in France to be too broad or severe, undermining freedom of speech.[139]\nFrance has laws against racism and antisemitism,[140] while the 1990 Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial.\n\n\nFreedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the basis for *laïcité* (state secularism): the state does not formally recognise any religion, except in Alsace-Moselle, which was part of Germany in 1905, and continues to subsidize education and clergy of Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Judaism. Nonetheless, France does recognise religious associations. The Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995 and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public; human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims.[141][142] However, it is supported by most of the population.[143]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of France\n\nFrance is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights.[144] In 2015, it was described as \"the best networked state in the world\" due to its membership in more international institutions than any other country;[145] these include the G7, World Trade Organization (WTO),[146] the Pacific Community (SPC)[147] and the Indian Ocean Commission (COI).[148] It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS)[149] and a leading member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) of 84 French-speaking countries.[150]\n\n\n\n![La Francophonie map (dozens of countries in Africa, Europe, Asia and Latin America are members of this international organisation.](image)88 states and governments are part of *La Francophonie*,[151] which promotes values of democracy, multilingualism and cultural diversity.[152] France has been a key member of this global organisation since its inception in 1970.\n![European Parliament opening in Strasbourg with crowd and many countries' flags on flagpoles](image)The European Parliament in Strasbourg (near the border with Germany). France is a founding member of all EU institutions.\nAs a significant hub for international relations, France has the third-largest assembly of diplomatic missions, second only to China and the United States, which are far more populous. It also hosts the headquarters of several international organisations, including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the OIF.[153]\n\n\nFrench foreign policy after World War II has been largely shaped by membership in the European Union, of which it was a founding member. Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.[154] In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process,[155] seeking to build its standing in continental Europe. However, since 1904, France has maintained an \"Entente cordiale\" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily.\n\n\nFrance is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but under President de Gaulle excluded itself from the joint military command, in protest of the Special Relationship between the United States and Britain, and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. Under Nicolas Sarkozy, France rejoined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.[156][157][158]\n\n\nFrance retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (*Françafrique*)[159] and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.[160] From 2012 to 2021, France and other African states intervened in support of the Malian government in the Northern Mali conflict.\n\n\nIn 2017, France was the world's fourth-largest donor of development aid in absolute terms, behind the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.[161] This represents 0.43% of its GNP, the 12th highest among the OECD.[162] Aid is provided by the governmental French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub-Saharan Africa,[163] with an emphasis on \"developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy\".[163]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French Armed Forces\n\n![](image)\nDassault Rafale of the Armée de l'Air et de l'Espace\n![](image)\n*Charles de Gaulle* aircraft carrier of the Marine nationale\n![](image)\nAMX Leclerc tank of the Armée de terre\n\nThe French Armed Forces (*Forces armées françaises*) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the President of the Republic as supreme commander. They consist of the French Army (*Armée de Terre*), the French Navy (*Marine Nationale*, formerly called *Armée de Mer*), the French Air and Space Force (*Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace*), and the National Gendarmerie (*Gendarmerie nationale*), which serves as both military police and civil police in rural areas. Together they are among the largest armed forces in the world and the largest in the EU. According to a 2018 study by Crédit Suisse, the French Armed Forces ranked as the world's sixth-most powerful military, and the second most powerful in Europe after Russia.[164] France's annual military expenditure in 2022 was US$53.6 billion, or 1.9% of its GDP, making it the eighth biggest military spender in the world.[165] There has been no national conscription since 1997.[166]\n\n\nFrance has been a recognised nuclear state since 1960. It is a party to both the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)[167] and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The French nuclear force (formerly known as \"*Force de Frappe*\") consists of four *Triomphant* class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 *ASMP* medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads;[168] 50 are deployed by the Air and Space Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's *Super Étendard Modernisé* (SEM) attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier *Charles de Gaulle*. The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved *ASMP-A* missile with a nuclear warhead.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFrance has major military industries and one of the largest aerospace sectors in the world.[169] The country has produced such equipment as the Rafale fighter, the *Charles de Gaulle* aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile and the Leclerc tank among others. France is actively investing in European joint projects such as the Eurocopter Tiger, multipurpose frigates, the UCAV demonstrator nEUROn and the Airbus A400M.[*citation needed*] France is a major arms seller,[170][171] with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market, except for nuclear-powered devices.\n\n\nOne French intelligence unit, the Directorate-General for External Security (*Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure*), is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (*Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur*) is a division of the National Police Force (*Direction générale de la Police Nationale*).[*citation needed*] France's cybersecurity capabilities are regularly ranked as some of the most robust of any nation in the world.[172][173]\n\n\nFrench weapons exported totaled 27 billion euros in 2022, up from 11.7 billion euros the previous year 2021. Additionally, the UAE alone contributed more than 16 billion euros arms to the French total.[174] Among the largest French defence companies are Dassault, Thales and Safran.[175]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of France\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n![La Défense, seen from the Eiffel Tower](image)La Défense was in 2017 ranked by Ernst & Young as the leading central business district in continental Europe, and the fourth in the world.[176]France has a mixed market economy, characterised by sizeable government involvement, and economic diversity. For roughly two centuries, the French economy has consistently ranked among the ten largest globally; it is currently the world's ninth-largest by purchasing power parity, the seventh-largest by nominal GDP, and the second-largest in the European Union by both metrics.[177] France is considered an economic power, with membership in the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Group of Twenty largest economies.\n\n\nFrance's economy is highly diversified; services represent two-thirds of both the workforce and GDP,[178] while the industrial sector accounts for a fifth of GDP and a similar proportion of employment. France is the third-biggest manufacturing country in Europe, behind Germany and Italy, and ranks eighth in the world by share of global manufacturing output, at 1.9 per cent.[179] Less than 2 per cent of GDP is generated by the primary sector, namely agriculture;[180] however, France's agricultural sector is among the largest in value and leads the EU in terms of overall production.[181]\n\n\nIn 2018, France was the fifth-largest trading nation in the world and the second-largest in Europe, with the value of exports representing over a fifth of GDP.[182] Its membership in the eurozone and the broader European single market facilitates access to capital, goods, services, and skilled labour.[183] Despite protectionist policies over certain industries, particularly in agriculture, France has generally played a leading role in fostering free trade and commercial integration in Europe to enhance its economy.[184][185] In 2019, it ranked first in Europe and 13th in the world in foreign direct investment, with European countries and the United States being leading sources.[186] According to the Bank of France (founded in 1800),[187] the leading recipients of FDI were manufacturing, real estate, finance and insurance.[188] The Paris Region has the highest concentration of multinational firms in Europe.[188]\n\n\nUnder the doctrine of *Dirigisme*, the government historically played a major role in the economy; policies such as indicative planning and nationalisation are credited for contributing to three decades of unprecedented postwar economic growth known as *Trente Glorieuses*. At its peak in 1982, the public sector accounted for one-fifth of industrial employment and over four-fifths of the credit market. Beginning in the late 20th century, France loosened regulations and state involvement in the economy, with most leading companies now being privately owned; state ownership now dominates only transportation, defence and broadcasting.[189] Policies aimed at promoting economic dynamism and privatisation have improved France's economic standing globally: it is among the world's 10 most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index,[190] and the 15th most competitive, according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report (up two places from 2018).[191]\n\n\nThe Paris stock exchange (French: *La Bourse de Paris*) is one of the oldest in the world, created by Louis XV in 1724.[192] In 2000, it merged with counterparts in Amsterdam and Brussels to form Euronext,[193] which in 2007 merged with the New York stock exchange to form NYSE Euronext, the world's largest stock exchange.[193] Euronext Paris, the French branch of NYSE Euronext, is Europe's second-largest stock exchange market, behind the London Stock Exchange. Some examples of the most valuable French companies include LVMH, L'Oréal and Sociéte Générale.[194]\n\n\nFrance has historically been one of the world's major agricultural centres and remains a \"global agricultural powerhouse\"; France is the world's sixth-biggest exporter of agricultural products, generating a trade surplus of over €7.4 billion.[195][196] Nicknamed \"the granary of the old continent\",[197] over half its total land area is farmland, of which 45 per cent is devoted to permanent field crops such as cereals. The country's diverse climate, extensive arable land, modern farming technology, and EU subsidies have made it Europe's leading agricultural producer and exporter.[198]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in France\n\n![](image)\nThe Eiffel Tower is the world's most-visited paid monument, an icon of both Paris and France.\n![](image)\nNice on the French Riviera\n![](image)\nMont-Saint-Michel and its bay were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1979.\n\nWith 89 million international tourist arrivals in 2018,[199] France is the world's top tourist destination, ahead of Spain (83 million) and the United States (80 million). However, it ranks third in tourism-derived income due to the shorter duration of visits.[200] The most popular tourist sites include (annual visitors): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Château de Versailles (2.8 million), Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (2 million), Pont du Gard (1.5 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Mont Saint-Michel (1 million), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000), Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), and Carcassonne (362,000).[201]\n\n\nFrance, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and most renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world (7.7 million visitors in 2022), the Musée d'Orsay (3.3 million), mostly devoted to Impressionism, the Musée de l'Orangerie (1.02 million), which is home to eight large Water Lily murals by Claude Monet, as well as the Centre Georges Pompidou (3 million), dedicated to contemporary art. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009.[202]\n\n\nWith more than 10 million tourists a year, the French Riviera (French: *Côte d'Azur*), in Southeast France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris Region.[203] It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometres (71 mi) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.[204]: 31 Each year the *Côte d'Azur* hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet.[204]: 66\n\n\nWith 6 million tourists a year, the castles of the Loire Valley (French: *châteaux*) and the Loire Valley itself are the third leading tourist destination in France;[205][206] this World Heritage Site is noteworthy for its architectural heritage, in its historic towns but in particular its castles, such as the Châteaux d'Amboise, de Chambord, d'Ussé, de Villandry, Chenonceau and Montsoreau. The Château de Chantilly, Versailles and Vaux-le-Vicomte, all three located near Paris, are also visitor attractions.\n\n\nFrance has 37 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, as well as rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association *Les Plus Beaux Villages de France* (literally \"The Most Beautiful Villages of France\"). The \"Remarkable Gardens\" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year.\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Energy in France\n\n![Nuclear power plant in Cattenom, France four large cooling towers expelling white water vapour against a blue sky](image)Belleville Nuclear Power Plant. France derives most of its electricity from nuclear power, the highest percentage in the world.\nFrance is the world's tenth-largest producer of electricity.[207] Électricité de France (EDF), which is majority-owned by the French government, is the country's main producer and distributor of electricity, and one of the world's largest electric utility companies, ranking third in revenue globally.[208] In 2018, EDF produced around one-fifth of the European Union's electricity, primarily from nuclear power.[209] As of 2021, France was the biggest energy exporter in Europe, mostly to the U.K. and Italy,[210] and the largest net exporter of electricity in the world.[210]\n\n\nSince the 1973 oil crisis, France has pursued a strong policy of energy security,[210] namely through heavy investment in nuclear energy. It is one of 32 countries with nuclear power plants, ranking second in the world by the number of operational nuclear reactors, at 56.[211] Consequently, 70% of France's electricity is generated by nuclear power, the highest proportion in the world by a wide margin;[212] only Slovakia and Ukraine derive a majority of electricity from nuclear power, at roughly 53% and 51%, respectively.[213] France is considered a world leader in nuclear technology, with reactors and fuel products being major exports.[210]\n\n\nDue to its overwhelming reliance on nuclear power, renewable energies have seen relatively little growth compared to other Western countries. Nevertheless, between 2008 and 2019, France's production capacity from renewable energies rose consistently and nearly doubled.[214] Hydropower is by far the leading source, accounting for over half the country's renewable energy sources[215] and contributing 13% of its electricity,[214] the highest proportion in Europe after Norway and Turkey.[215] As with nuclear power, most hydroelectric plants, such as Eguzon, Étang de Soulcem, and Lac de Vouglans, are managed by EDF.[215] France aims to further expand hydropower into 2040.[214]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in France\n\n![](image)Millau Viaduct is the tallest bridge in the world.[216]\nFrance's railway network, which stretches 29,473 kilometres (18,314 mi) as of 2008,[217] is the second most extensive in Western Europe after Germany.[218] It is operated by the SNCF, and high-speed trains include the Thalys, the Eurostar and TGV, which travels at 320 km/h (199 mph).[219] The Eurostar, along with the Eurotunnel Shuttle, connects with the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighbouring countries in Europe except Andorra. Intra-urban connections are also well developed, with most major cities having underground or tramway services complementing bus services.\n\n\nThere are approximately 1,027,183 kilometres (638,262 mi) of serviceable roadway in France, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent.[220] The Paris Region is enveloped with the densest network of roads and highways, which connect it with virtually all parts of the country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighbouring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee or road tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault, Peugeot and Citroën.[221] France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge,[222] and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie. Diesel and petrol-driven cars and lorries cause a large part of the country's air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.[223][224]\n\n\nThere are 464 airports in France.[88] Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world. Air France is the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports in France, the largest of which is in Marseille,[225] which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea.[226]12,261 kilometres (7,619 mi) of waterways traverse France including the Canal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through the Garonne river.[88]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Science and technology in France and List of French inventions and discoveries\n\n![Ariane 5 rocket](image)France is in 2020 the biggest national financial contributor to the European Space Agency,[227] which conceived the Ariane rocket family, launched from French Guiana (Ariane 5 pictured).\nSince the Middle Ages, France has been a contributor to scientific and technological achievement. In the early 11th century, the French-born Pope Sylvester II reintroduced the abacus and armillary sphere and introduced Arabic numerals and clocks to much of Europe.[228] The University of Paris, founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important academic institutions in the Western world.[229] In the 17th century, mathematician and philosopher René Descartes pioneered rationalism as a method for acquiring scientific knowledge, while Blaise Pascal became famous for his work on probability and fluid mechanics; both were key figures of the Scientific Revolution, which blossomed in Europe during this period. The French Academy of Sciences, founded in the mid-17th century by Louis XIV to encourage and protect French scientific research, was one of the earliest national scientific institutions in history.\n\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment was marked by the work of biologist Buffon, one of the first naturalists to recognise ecological succession, and chemist Lavoisier, who discovered the role of oxygen in combustion. Diderot and D'Alembert published the *Encyclopédie*, which aimed to give the public access to \"useful knowledge\" that could be applied to everyday life.[230] The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France, with Augustin Fresnel founding modern optics, Sadi Carnot laying the foundations of thermodynamics, and Louis Pasteur pioneering microbiology. Other eminent French scientists of the period have their names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. \n\n\nFamous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré; physicists Henri Becquerel, Pierre and Marie Curie, who remain famous for their work on radioactivity; physicist Paul Langevin; and virologist Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of HIV AIDS. Hand transplantation was developed in Lyon in 1998 by an international team that included Jean-Michel Dubernard, who afterward performed the first successful double hand transplant.[231] Telesurgery was first performed by French surgeons led by Jacques Marescaux on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean.[232] A face transplant was first done on 27 November 2005 by Bernard Devauchelle.[233][234] France ranked 11th in the 2023 Global Innovation Index, compared to 16th in 2019.[235][236][237][238]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of France\n\n![](image)Population density in France by arrondissement\nWith an estimated January 2023 population of 68,042,591 people,[8] France is the 20th most populous country in the world, the third-most populous in Europe (after Russia and Germany), and the second most populous in the European Union (after Germany).\n\n\nFrance is an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate of natural population growth: By birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006.[239] Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second-highest overall increase in population in the EU and was one of only four EU countries where natural births accounted for the most population growth.[240] This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973 and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010.\n\n\nAs of January 2021[update], the fertility rate declined slightly to 1.84 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1, and considerably below the high of 4.41 in 1800.[241][242][243][244] France's fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain among the highest in the EU. However, like many developed nations, the French population is aging; the average age is 41.7 years, while about a fifth of French people are 65 or over.[245] The life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years, the 12th highest in the world.\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 per cent per year;[246] since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 per cent annually.[247] Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27 per cent of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and another 24 per cent had at least one parent born outside Europe (excluding French overseas territories).[248]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French people\n\nHistorically, French people were mainly of Celtic-Gallic origin, with a significant admixture of Italic (Romans) and Germanic (Franks) groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement.[249] Through the course of the Middle Ages, France incorporated various neighbouring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced by Breton elements in the west, Aquitanian in the southwest, Scandinavian in the northwest, Alemannic in the northeast, and Ligurian in the southeast.\n\n\nLarge-scale immigration over the last century and a half have led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the French Revolution, and further codified in the French Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004, the *Institut Montaign*e estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).[250][251]\n\n\nA 2008 poll conducted jointly by the Institut national d'études démographiques and the French National Institute of Statistics[252][253] estimated that the largest ancestry groups were Italian (5 million), followed by Northwest African (3–6 million),[254][255][256] Sub-Saharan African (2.5 million), Armenian (500,000), and Turkish (200,000).[257] There are also sizeable minorities of other European ethnic groups, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.[254][258][259] France has a significant Gitan (Romani) population, numbering between 20,000 and 400,000;[260] many foreign Roma are expelled back to Bulgaria and Romania frequently.[261]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to France\n\nIt is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early 20th century;[262] between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.[263] The next largest wave came in the 1960s when around 1.6 million *pieds noirs* returned to France following the independence of its Northwest African possessions, Algeria and Morocco.[264][265] They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Calais Jungle was a refugee and illegal migrant encampment in the vicinity of Calais, France, that existed from January 2015 to October 2016.\nFrance remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.[266] In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications (albeit a 15% decrease from 2004).[267] In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications—placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world[268] and in subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017.[269] The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration,[*citation needed*] and immigration remains a contentious political issue.\n\n\nIn 2008, the INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million were of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi ancestry.[270][271][272] In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.[273]\n\n\nIn 2014, the INSEE reported a significant increase in the number of immigrants coming from Spain, Portugal and Italy between 2009 and 2012. According to the French Institute, this increase resulted from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period.[274] Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 per cent between 2009 and 2012, with the population growing from 5,300 to 11,000.[274] Of the total of 229,000 foreigners who were in France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, 5% British, 5% Spanish, 4% Italian, 4% German, 3% Romanian, and 3% Belgian.[274]\n\n\n\n### Major cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Functional area (France) and Urban unit\n\nFrance is a highly urbanised country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population in 2019[275]) being Paris (13,114,718 inh.), Lyon (2,280,845), Marseille (1,873,270), Lille (1,510,079), Toulouse (1,454,158), Bordeaux (1,363,711), Nantes (1,011,020), Strasbourg (853,110), Montpellier (801,595), and Rennes (755,668). (Note: since its 2020 revision of metropolitan area borders, INSEE considers that Nice is a metropolitan area separate from the Cannes-Antibes metropolitan area; these two combined would have a population of 1,008,296, as of the 2019 census). Rural flight was a perennial political issue throughout most of the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in France2019 census\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |\n| ![Paris](image)Paris![Lyon](image)Lyon | 1 | Paris | Île-de-France | 13,114,718 | 11 | Grenoble | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 717,469\n |\n| 2 | Lyon | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 2,280,845 | 12 | Rouen | Normandy | 705,627\n |\n| 3 | Marseille | Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur | 1,873,270 | 13 | Nice | Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur | 615,126\n |\n| 4 | Lille | Hauts-de-France | 1,510,079 | 14 | Toulon | Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur | 573,230\n |\n| 5 | Toulouse | Occitania (administrative region) | 1,454,158 | 15 | Tours | Centre-Val de Loire | 519,778\n |\n| 6 | Bordeaux | Nouvelle-Aquitaine | 1,363,711 | 16 | Nancy | Grand Est | 510,306\n |\n| 7 | Nantes | Pays de la Loire | 1,011,020 | 17 | Clermont-Ferrand | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 507,479\n |\n| 8 | Strasbourg | Grand Est | 853,110 | 18 | Saint-Étienne | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 498,849\n |\n| 9 | Montpellier | Occitania (administrative region) | 801,595 | 19 | Caen | Normandy | 472,161\n |\n| 10 | Rennes | Brittany | 755,668 | 20 | Orléans | Centre-Val de Loire | 451,373\n |\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: French language, Languages of France, and Organisation internationale de la Francophonie\n\n![world map of French speaking countries](image)Map of the Francophone world: Native language\n Administrative language\n Secondary or cultural language\n\nThe official language of France is French,[276] a Romance language derived from Latin. Since 1635, the Académie française has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as Occitan, Breton, Catalan, Flemish (Dutch dialect), Alsatian (German dialect), Basque, and Corsican (Italian dialect). Italian was the official language of Corsica until 9 May 1859.[277]\n\n\nThe Government of France does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. The perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French overseas territories. It is estimated that between 300 million[278] and 500 million[279] people worldwide can speak French, either as a mother tongue or as a second language.\n\n\nAccording to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried out in France by the INSEE and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French was the native language of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000). Native speakers of other languages made up the remaining 5.2% of the population.[280]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in France\n\n![Notre-Dame de Reims façade, gothic stone cathedral against blue sky](image)Notre-Dame de Reims is the Roman Catholic cathedral where the Kings of France were crowned until 1825.[XIII]\nFrance is a secular country in which freedom of religion is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of *laïcité*, a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular. The exception to this is the region of Alsace and Moselle where Lutheranism, Catholicism and Judaism enjoy official status and state funding.\n\n\nAccording to a survey held in 2016 by Institut Montaigne and Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian, 39.6% had no religion (atheism or agnosticism), 5.6% were Muslims, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith.[281] Estimates of the number of Muslims in France vary widely. In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8–10%).[282][283] The current Jewish community in France is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world after Israel and the United States, ranging between 480,000 and 600,000, about 0.8% of the population as of 2016.[281]\n\n\nCatholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practised today as it was. Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic.[284] During the French Revolution, activists conducted a brutal campaign of de-Christianisation, ending the Catholic Church as the state religion. In some cases, clergy and churches were attacked, with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornaments. After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, in 1905 France passed the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which established the principle of *laïcité*.[285]\n\n\nTo this day, the government is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle). It recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policymaking.[286]\n\n\nCertain groups, such as Scientology, Children of God, the Unification Church, or the Order of the Solar Temple are considered cults (\"*sectes*\" in French); therefore they do not have the same status as recognised religions in France.[287] *Secte* is considered a pejorative term in France.[288]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in France\n\n![Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, stone building with slate dome](image)The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, a teaching hospital in Paris, is one of Europe's largest hospitals.[289]\nThe French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the \"close to best overall health care\" in the world.[290] The French health care system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997.[291][292] In 2011, France spent 11.6% of its GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,[293] a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but less than in the United States. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government-funded agencies.[294]\n\n\nCare is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases (*affections de longues durées*) such as cancer, AIDS or cystic fibrosis. The life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women, one of the highest in the European Union and the World.[295][296] There are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in France,[297] and average health care spending per capita was US$4,719 in 2008.[298]\nAs of 2007[update], approximately 140,000 inhabitants (0.4%) of France are living with HIV/AIDS.[88]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in France\n\n![](image)The ENS produces among the most Nobel Prize laureates per capita in the world.[299]\nIn 1802, Napoleon created the lycée, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession.[300] Nevertheless, Jules Ferry is considered the father of the French modern school, leading reforms in the late 19th century that established free, secular and compulsory education (currently mandatory until the age of 16).[301][302]\n\n\nFrench education is centralised and divided into three stages: Primary, secondary, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as near the OECD average in 2018.[303][304] France was one of the PISA-participating countries where school children perceived some of the lowest levels of support and feedback from their teachers.[304] Schoolchildren in France reported greater concern about the disciplinary climate and behaviour in classrooms compared to other OECD countries.[304]\n\n\nHigher education is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective *Grandes écoles*, such as Sciences Po Paris for Political studies, HEC Paris for Economics, Polytechnique, the École des hautes études en sciences sociales for Social studies and the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris that produce high-profile engineers, or the École nationale d'administration for careers in the Grands Corps of the state. The *Grandes écoles* have been criticised for alleged elitism, producing many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs and politicians.[305]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of France\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French art\n\n![](image)Claude Monet, founder of the Impressionist movement\nThe origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance firsthand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of the Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy. \n\n\nFrench artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of the old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism.\n\n\nIn the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting grew, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir.[306] The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,[307] as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.[308][309]\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Vincent van Gogh, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Wassily Kandinsky.\n\n\nThere are many art museums in France, the most famous of which being the state-owned Musée du Louvre, which collects artwork from the 18th century and earlier. The Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).[310][311] It was voted the best museum in the world in 2018.[312] Modern works are presented in the Musée National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou. These three state-owned museums are visited by close to 17 million people a year.[313]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French architecture\n\n![Sainte Chapelle interior showing painted stonework vaulting and stained glass](image)Saint Louis's Sainte-Chapelle represents the French impact on religious architecture.\nDuring the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Château d'Angers, the massive Château de Vincennes and the so-called Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe.\n\n\nGothic architecture, originally named *Opus Francigenum* meaning \"French work\",[314] was born in Île-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be imitated throughout Europe.[315] Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims.[316]\n\n\nThe final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley, from 1450 as a first reference the Château de Montsoreau.[317] Examples of such residential castles include the Château de Chambord, the Château de Chenonceau, or the Château d'Amboise.\n\n\nFollowing the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found greater success in the secular domain than in the religious one.[318] In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architects of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides.[319] Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.[320][321]\n\n\nAfter the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although it was introduced in France before the revolution with such buildings as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire-style architecture.[322] Under Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; most notably, Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated with this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as the Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\nIn the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 metres (121 ft).[323] France's largest financial district is La Défense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.[324] Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc and Paul Andreu.\n\n\n\n### Literature and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: French literature and French philosophy\n\nThe earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts, such as *Tristan and Iseult* and *Lancelot-Grail* are unknown. Three famous medieval authors are Chrétien de Troyes, Christine de Pizan (langue d'oïl), and Duke William IX of Aquitaine (langue d'oc). Much medieval French poetry and literature was inspired by the legends of the Carolingian cycle, such as *The Song of Roland* and the various chansons de geste. The *Roman de Renart*, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character Reynard ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was François Rabelais, who wrote five popular early picaresque novels. Rabelais was also in regular communication with Marguerite de Navarre, author of the *Heptameron*.[325] Another 16th-century author was Michel de Montaigne, whose most famous work, *Essais*, started a literary genre.[326]\n\n\nFrench literature and poetry flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot's best-known works are *Jacques the Fatalist* and *Rameau's Nephew*. He is best known, however, as the main editor of the *Encyclopédie*, whose aim was, to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, and philosophy) and to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of children's fairy tales including *Puss in Boots*, *Cinderella*, *Sleeping Beauty* and *Bluebeard*. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé.[327]\n\n\nThe 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as \"the greatest French writer of all time\"[328] for excelling in all literary genres. The preface of his play *Cromwell* is considered to be the manifesto of the Romantic movement. *Les Contemplations* and *La Légende des siècles* are considered \"poetic masterpieces\",[329] Hugo's verse has been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer.[329] His novel *Les Misérables* is widely seen as one of the greatest novels ever written[330] and *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* has remained immensely popular. Other major authors of that century include Alexandre Dumas (*The Three Musketeers* and *The Count of Monte-Cristo*), Jules Verne (*Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*), Émile Zola (*Les Rougon-Macquart*), Honoré de Balzac (*La Comédie humaine*), Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gautier and Stendhal (*The Red and the Black*, *The Charterhouse of Parma*), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world.\n\n\nIn the early 20th century France was a haven for literary freedom.[331] Works banned for obscenity in the US, the UK and other Anglophone nations were published in France decades before they were available in the respective authors' home countries.[331] The French were disinclined to punish literary figures for their writing, and prosecutions were rare.[331] Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Jean Cocteau, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint Exupéry wrote *The Little Prince*, which has remained popular for decades and is one of the best selling books in history.[332][333]\n\n\nMedieval philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism until the emergence of Humanism in the Renaissance. Modern philosophy began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of René Descartes, Blaise Pascal and Nicolas Malebranche. Descartes was the first Western philosopher since ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors.[334][335] France in the 18th Century saw major philipshocial contributions from Voltaire who came to embody the Enlightenment and Jean-Jacques Rousseau whose work highly influenced the French Revolution.[336][337] French philosophers made major contributions to the field in the 20th century including the existentialist works of Simone de Beauvoir, Camus, and Sartre.[338] Other influential contributions during this time include the moral and political works of Simone Weil, contributions to structuralism including from Claude Lévi-Strauss and the post-structuralist works by Michel Foucault.[339][340]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of France\n\n![](image)Claude Debussy\nFrance has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed many talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer of the harpsichord.[341][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nÉrik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his *Gymnopédies*.[*citation needed*] Francis Poulenc's best-known works are his piano suite *Trois mouvements perpétuels* (1919), the ballet *Les biches* (1923), the *Concert champêtre* (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera *Dialogues des Carmélites* (1957) and the *Gloria* (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.[342] Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms[343][344][345][346] and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as *Jeux d'eau*, *Miroirs*, *Le tombeau de Couperin* and *Gaspard de la nuit*, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the *Rapsodie espagnole*, *Daphnis et Chloé*, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's *Pictures at an Exhibition* and his orchestral work *Boléro* (1928). More recently, in the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolution of contemporary classical music.[347]\n\n\nFrench music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music in the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as *chanson française*, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg.[348] Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries,[349] bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira,[350] or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity.\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of France\n\n![Palme d'Or award in presentation case](image)A *Palme d'Or* from the Cannes Film Festival, one of the \"Big Three\" film festivals alongside the Venice Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival[351][352][353]\nFrance has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the Lumière Brothers) credited with creating cinema in 1895.[354] The world's first female filmmaker, Alice Guy-Blaché, was also from France.[355] Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the Government of France. France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2015[update] producing more films than any other European country.[356][357] The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.[358][359]\n\n\nApart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé, Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke) and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur or Francis Veber in the United States. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.[360] French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK.[360] In 2013 France was the second greatest exporter of films in the world, after the United States.[361]\n\n\nAs part of its advocacy of cultural exception, a political concept of treating culture differently from other commercial products,[362] France succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993.[363] Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a vote by UNESCO in 2005: the principle of \"cultural exception\" won an overwhelming victory with 198 countries voting for it and only 2 countries, the United States and Israel, voting against it.[364]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French fashion\n\n![Chanel's headquarters storefront window at the Place Vendôme Paris with awning](image)Chanel's headquarters on Place Vendôme, Paris\nFashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern \"haute couture\" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.\n\n\nThe association of France with fashion and style (French: *la mode*) dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV[365] when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (French: *couture or haute couture*) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishment of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. The French perfume industry is the world leader in its sector and is centred on the town of Grasse.[366]\n\n\nAccording to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor.[367] Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH, Kering SA, L'Oréal), more than any other country in the world.[367]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in France\n\n![](image)*Le Figaro* was founded in 1826 and it is still considered a newspaper of record.[368]\nIn 2021, regional daily newspapers (like *Ouest-France*, *Sud Ouest*, *La Voix du Nord*, *Dauphiné Libéré*, *Le Télégramme*, and *Le Progrès*) more than doubled the sales of national newspapers (like *Le Monde*, *Le Figaro*, *L'Équipe* (sports), *Le Parisien*, and *Les Echos* (finance). Free dailies, distributed in metropolitan centers, continue to increase their market share.[369] The sector of weekly magazines includes more than 400 specialised weekly magazines published in the country.[370]\n\n\nThe most influential news magazines are the left-wing *Le Nouvel Observateur*, centrist *L'Express* and right-wing *Le Point* (in 2009 more than 400,000 copies),[371] but the highest circulation numbers for weeklies are attained by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them *Marie Claire* and *ELLE*, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers *Le Canard Enchaîné* and *Charlie Hebdo*, as well as *Paris Match*. As in most industrialised nations, the print media have been affected by a severe crisis with the rise of the internet. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent,[372][373] but in 2009 it had to give 600,000 euros to help the print media cope with the economic crisis, in addition to existing subsidies.[374]\nIn 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations[375][376] remained under state control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending the state monopoly on radio.[376]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French cuisine\n\n![](image)French wines are usually made to accompany French cuisine.\nFrench cuisine is renowned for being one of the finest in the world.[377][378] Different regions have different styles. In the North, butter and cream are common ingredients, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the South.[379] Each region of France has traditional specialties: cassoulet in the Southwest, choucroute in Alsace, quiche in the Lorraine region, beef bourguignon in Burgundy, provençal tapenade, etc. France is most famous for its wines,[380] and cheeses, which are often named for the territory where they are produced (AOC).[381][382] A meal typically consists of three courses, *entrée* (starter), *plat principal* (main course), and *fromage* (cheese) or *dessert*, sometimes with a salad served before the cheese or dessert.\n\n\nFrench cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the quality of life and the attractiveness of France. A French publication, the Michelin guide, awards *Michelin stars* for excellence to a select few establishments.[383][384] The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants.[385]\n\n\nIn addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine. French rum is made in distilleries located on islands in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.[386][387]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in France\n\n![The peloton in the streets of Nice during the 2nd stage of the Tour de France on 30 August 2020](image)Starting in 1903, the Tour de France is the oldest and most prestigious of Grands Tours, and the world's most famous cycling race.[388]\nFrance hosts \"the world's biggest annual sporting event\", the Tour de France.[389] Other popular sports played in France include: football, judo, tennis,[390] rugby union[391] and pétanque. France has hosted events such as the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups,[392] the 2007 Rugby World Cup,[393] and will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The country also hosted the 1960 European Nations' Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, UEFA Euro 2016 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1923, France is famous for its 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race.[394] Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including the Paris Masters and the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. French martial arts include Savate and Fencing.\n\n![](image)Zidane was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in a 2004 UEFA poll.[395]\nFrance has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games' revival, at the end of the 19th century.[396][397] After Athens was awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics' Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Games in 1900.[398] Paris was the first home of the International Olympic Committee, before it moved to Lausanne.[399] Since 1900, France has hosted the Olympics on 4 further occasions: the 1924 Summer Olympics, again in Paris[397] and three Winter Games (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble and 1992 in Albertville).[397] Similar to the Olympics, France introduced Olympics for the deaf people (Deaflympics) in 1924 with the idea of a French deaf car mechanic, Eugène Rubens-Alcais who paved the way to organise the inaugural edition of the Summer Deaflympics in Paris.[400]\n\n\nBoth the national football team and the national rugby union team are nicknamed \"*Les Bleus*\" in reference to the team's shirt colour as well as the national French tricolour flag. Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players and over 18,000 registered clubs.[401]\n\n\nThe French Open, also called Roland-Garros, is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments.[402]\n\n\nRugby union is popular, particularly in Paris and the southwest of France.[403] The national rugby union team has competed at every Rugby World Cup; it takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* Outline of France\n\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The current Constitution of France does not specify a national emblem.[1] The lictor's fasces is very often used to represent the French Republic, although today it holds no official status.[2] In addition to the coat of arms, France also uses a different emblem for diplomatic and consular purposes.\n2. **^** For information about regional languages, see Languages of France.\n3. **^** European Union since 1993\n4. **^** French National Geographic Institute data, which includes bodies of water\n5. **^** French Land Register data, which exclude lakes, ponds and glaciers larger than 1 km2 (0.386 sq mi or 247 acres) as well as the estuaries of rivers\n6. **^** Whole of the except the overseas territories in the Pacific Ocean\n7. **^** French overseas territories in the Pacific Ocean only\n8. **^** Time zones across the span from UTC−10 (French Polynesia) to UTC+12 (Wallis and Futuna)\n9. **^** Daylight saving time is observed in metropolitan France and Saint Pierre and Miquelon only.\n10. **^** The overseas regions and collectivities form part of the French telephone numbering plan, but have their own country calling codes: Guadeloupe +590; Martinique +596; French Guiana +594; Réunion and Mayotte +262; Saint Pierre and Miquelon +508.

Adding these give the total shown here for the entire French Republic. The World Factbook reports the total as 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi).\n |\n\n\n**France** (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ⓘ), officially the **French Republic** (French: *République française* [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛːz]),[14] is a country located primarily in Western Europe. It also includes overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans,[XII] giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the north east, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the south east, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the north west. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and have a total population of over 68 million as of January 2023[update].[5][8] France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Nice.\n\n\nMetropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Germanic Franks formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, the French Renaissance saw culture flourish and a French colonial empire rise.[15] Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.[16]\n\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars significantly shaped the course of European history. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allied powers of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied by the Axis in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.\n\n\nFrance retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science and philosophy. It hosts the fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018.[17] France is a developed country with a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world. It is a great power in global affairs,[18] being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the eurozone,[19] as well as a key member of the Group of Seven, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Francophonie.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and pronunciation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of France\n\nOriginally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name *France* comes from the Latin *Francia*, or \"realm of the Franks\".[20] Modern France is still named today *Francia* in Italian and Spanish, while *Frankreich* in German, *Frankrijk* in Dutch and *Frankrike* in Swedish and Norwegian all mean \"Land/realm of the Franks\".\n\n\nThe name of the Franks is related to the English word *frank* (\"free\"): the latter stems from the Old French *franc* (\"free, noble, sincere\"), ultimately from Medieval Latin *francus* (\"free, exempt from service; freeman, Frank\"), a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as a Late Latin borrowing of the reconstructed Frankish endonym \\**Frank*.[21][22] It has been suggested that the meaning \"free\" was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation,[23] or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves.[22]\n\n\nThe etymology of *\\*Frank* is uncertain. It is traditionally derived from the Proto-Germanic word \\**frankōn*, which translates as \"javelin\" or \"lance\" (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the *francisca*),[24] although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.[22]\n\n\nIn English, 'France' is pronounced /fræns/ *FRANSS* in American English and /frɑːns/ *FRAHNSS* or /fræns/ *FRANSS* in British English. The pronunciation with /ɑː/ is mostly confined to accents with the trap-bath split such as Received Pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as Cardiff English, in which /frɑːns/ is in free variation with /fræns/.[25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of France\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of French history.\n\n### Prehistory (before the 6th century BC)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistory of France\n\nThe oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.[26] Neanderthals occupied the region into the Upper Paleolithic era but were slowly replaced by *Homo sapiens* around 35,000 BCE.[27] This period witnessed the emergence of cave painting in the Dordogne and the Pyrenees, including at the famous Lascaux site, dated to c. 18,000 BC.[26] At the end of the Last Glacial Period (10,000 BC), the climate became milder;[26] from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era, and its inhabitants became sedentary.\n\n\nAfter strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, initially working gold, copper and bronze, then later iron.[28] France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic, including the exceptionally dense Carnac stones site (approximately 3,300 BC).\n\n\n\n### Antiquity (6th century BC – 5th century AD)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Gaul, Celts, and Roman Gaul\n\nIn 600 BC, Ionian Greeks from Phocaea founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This makes it France's oldest city.[29] At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern France, gradually spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC.[30]\n\n\n\n![Maison Carrée temple in Nemausus Corinthian columns and portico](image)The Maison Carrée was a temple of the Gallo-Roman city of Nemausus (present-day Nîmes) and is one of the best-preserved vestiges of the Roman Empire.\nAround 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Roman Italy through the Alps, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome.[31] The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome.[32] But the Romans and the Gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries, and the Gauls would continue to be a threat in Italy.[33]\n\n\nAround 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region *Provincia Nostra* (\"Our Province\"), which over time evolved into the name Provence in French.[34] Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC.[35] Gaul was divided by Augustus into Roman provinces.[36] Many cities were founded during the Gallo-Roman period, including Lugdunum (present-day Lyon), which is considered the capital of the Gauls.[36]\n\n\nFrom the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians.[37] Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.[38] In 312, Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity. Subsequently, Christians who had been persecuted increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire.[39] But from the beginning of the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed.[40] Teutonic tribes invaded the region from present-day Germany, the Visigoths settling in the southwest, the Burgundians along the Rhine River Valley, and the Franks in the north.[41]\n\n\n\n### Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Francia, Merovingian dynasty, and Carolingian dynasty\n\nSee also: List of French monarchs and France in the Middle Ages\n\nAt the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled in the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived, and independent petty kingdoms arose in the region.\n\n\nThe first leader to unite all Franks was Clovis I, who began his reign as king of the Salian Franks in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors of the province in 486. Clovis claimed that he would be baptised a Christian in the event of his victory against the Visigothic Kingdom, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis regained the southwest from the Visigoths, was baptised in 508 and made himself master of what is now western Germany.\n\n\nClovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title \"Eldest daughter of the Church\" (*French: *La fille aînée de l'Église**) by the papacy,[42] and French kings would be called \"the Most Christian Kings of France\" (**Rex Christianissimus**).\n\n\n\n![painting of Clovis I conversion to Catholicism in 498, a king being baptised in a tub in a cathedral surrounded by bishop and monks](image)With Clovis's conversion to Catholicism in 498, the Frankish monarchy, elective and secular until then, became hereditary and of divine right.\nThe Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture, and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed *Francia* (\"Land of the Franks\"). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages, except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Umayyad invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe.\n\n\nProclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church,[43] Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son, Louis I (r. 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald. West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was its precursor.[44]\n\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by Viking invasions, France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added \"King of England\" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions.\n\n\n\n### High and Late Middle Ages (10th–15th century)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: France in the Middle Ages\n\n![](image)Joan of Arc led the French Army to several important victories during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), which paved the way for the final victory.\nThe Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned king of the Franks.[45] This date is often used as the transtition between West Francia and the Kingdom of France. His descendants—the direct Capetians, the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon—progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance. Starting from 1190, during the reign of Philip II, the Capetian rulers began to be referred as \"kings of France\" (*rex Francie*) rather than \"kings of the Franks\" (*rex Francorum*).[46] Later kings would expand their directly possessed *domaine royal* to cover over half of modern continental France by the 15th century, including most of the north, centre and west of France. During this process, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners.\n\n\nThe French nobility played a prominent role in most Crusades to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the 200-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as *Franj* caring little whether they came from France.[47] The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the *lingua franca* (lit. \"Frankish language\") of the Crusader states.[47] French knights also made up the majority in both the Hospital and the Temple orders. The latter in particular held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, until Philip IV annihilated the order in 1307. The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of France.[48]\n\n\nFrom the 11th century, the House of Plantagenet, the rulers of the County of Anjou, succeeded in establishing its dominion over the surrounding provinces of Maine and Touraine, then progressively built an \"empire\" that spanned from England to the Pyrenees and covering half of modern France. Tensions between the kingdom of France and the Plantagenet empire would last a hundred years, until Philip II of France conquered, between 1202 and 1214, most of the continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and Aquitaine to the Plantagenets.\n\n\nCharles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.[49] Under Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.[49] Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, rather than through the female line to Edward of Plantagenet, who would soon become Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.[49] However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-on Hundred Years' War.[50] The boundaries changed greatly with time, but landholdings inside France by the English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, strong French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death, from which half of the 17 million population of France died.[51]\n\n\n\n### Early modern period (15th century–1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ancien Régime and France in the early modern period\n\nThe French Renaissance saw spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as the Italian Wars, between France and the House of Habsburg. French explorers such as Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.[52] The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. Spanish troops, the terror of Western Europe,[53] assisted the Catholic side from 1589 to 1594 and invaded northern France in 1597; after some skirmishing in the 1620s and 1630s, Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The war cost France 300,000 casualties.[54]\n\n\nUnder Louis XIII, Cardinal Richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s. He systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence (duelling, carrying weapons and maintaining private armies). By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established \"the royal monopoly of force\" as the doctrine.[55]\n\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th century, France was responsible for 11% of the transatlantic slave trade,[56] second only to Great Britain during the 18th century.[57] While the state began condoning the practice with letters patent in the 1630s, Louis XIII only formalized this authorization more generally in 1642 in the last year of his reign. By the mid-18th century, Nantes had become the principal French slave-trading port.[56]\n\n\n\n![Louis XIV of France standing in plate armour and blue sash facing left holding baton](image)Louis XIV, the \"Sun King\", was the absolute monarch of France and made France the leading European power.During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in France. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, his command of the military went unchallenged. Remembered for numerous wars, the so-called \"Sun King\" made France the leading European power. France became the most populous country in Europe and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.[58] During his reign, France took colonial control of many overseas territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. In 1685, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published the *Code Noir* providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jewish people from the French colonies.[59]\n\n\nUnder the wars of Louis XV (r. 1715–1774), France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). Its European territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions—as well as the decadence of his court—discredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for the French Revolution 15 years after his death.[60]\n\n\nLouis XVI (r. 1774–1793) actively supported the Americans with money, fleets and armies, helping them win independence from Great Britain. France gained revenge but spent so heavily that the government verged on bankruptcy—a factor that contributed to the French Revolution. Some of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the naming of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source of legitimacy, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and also was a factor in the French Revolution.\n\n\n\n### Revolutionary France (1789–1799)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of France § Revolutionary France (1789–1799)\n\n![drawing of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, smoke of gunfire enveloping stone castle](image)The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the French Revolution.\nFacing financial troubles, Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General (gathering the three Estates of the realm) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estate formed a National Assembly, signalling the outbreak of the French Revolution. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents stormed the Bastille on 14 July 1789, a date which would become France's National Day.\n\n\nIn early August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights. Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (27 August 1789), France established fundamental rights for men. The declaration affirms \"the natural and imprescriptible rights of man\" to \"liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression\". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests were outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth. In November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalise and sell all property of the Catholic Church which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a Civil Constitution of the Clergy reorganised the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes in June 1791 seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.\n\n\nIn the August 1791 Declaration of Pillnitz, the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia threatened to restore the French monarch by force. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced Louis XVI to accept the French Constitution of 1791, thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. In the newly established Legislative Assembly (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group later called the 'Girondins', who favoured war with Austria and Prussia, and a group later called 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins' who opposed such a war. A majority in the Assembly in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government and thought that such a war could be won and so declared war on Austria on 20 April 1792.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Le Serment du Jeu de paume* by Jacques-Louis David, 1791\nOn 10 August 1792, an angry crowd threatened the palace of Louis XVI, who took refuge in the Legislative Assembly.[61][62] A Prussian army invaded France later in August 1792. In early September, Parisians, infuriated by the Prussian Army capturing Verdun and counter-revolutionary uprisings in the west of France, murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners by raiding the Parisian prisons. The Assembly and the Paris City Council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed.[61][63] The National Convention, chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage,[61] on 20 September 1792 succeeded the Legislative Assembly and on 21 September abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the French First Republic. Louis XVI was convicted of treason and guillotined in January 1793. France had declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria and Prussia invaded France; in March, France created a \"sister republic\" in the \"Republic of Mainz\" and kept it under control.\n\n\nAlso in March 1793, a counter-revolution in Vendée began, evoked by both the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 and the nationwide army conscription in early 1793; elsewhere in France rebellion was brewing too. A factionalist feud in the National Convention, smouldering ever since October 1791, came to a climax on 2 June 1793 with the group of the Girondins being forced to resign and leave the convention. By July the counter-revolution had spread to Brittany, Normandy, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, and Lyon. Between October and December 1793, Paris' Convention government took brutal measures to subdue most internal uprisings at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives.[64] By the end of 1793, the allies had been driven from France. \n\n\nPolitical disagreements and enmity in the National Convention reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. Meanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were prospering, for example in Belgium. In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food. Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and royalism.\n\n\n\n### Napoleon and 19th century (1799–1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of France § Napoleonic France (1799–1815); and History of France § Long 19th century, 1815–1914\n\nSee also: France in the long nineteenth century and History of France (1900–present)\n\n![painting of Napoleon in 1806 standing with hand in vest attended by staff and Imperial guard regiment](image)Napoleon, Emperor of the French, built a vast empire across Europe.[65]\nGeneral Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the French Revolutionary Wars, changing sets of European coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt and Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.[66]\n\n\nThese victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. In June 1812 Napoleon attacked Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After the catastrophic Russian campaign and the ensuing uprising of European monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.[66] After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, and the Bourbon monarchy was restored with new constitutional limitations.\n\n\nThe discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy. In that year, French troops began the conquest of Algeria, establishing the first colonial presence in Africa since Napoleon's abortive invasion of Egypt in 1798. In 1848, general unrest led to the February Revolution and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage, which were briefly enacted during the French Revolution, was re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the president of the French Republic, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the Second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, Mexico and Italy which resulted in the annexation of the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and his regime was replaced by the Third Republic. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete, with approximately 825,000 Algerians killed from famine, disease, and violence.[67]\n\n\n\n![](image)The first (light blue) and second (dark blue) French colonial empire\nFrance had colonial possessions, in various forms since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second-largest in the world behind the British Empire.[15] Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under French sovereignty reached almost 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land. Known as the *Belle Époque*, the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, state secularism was officially established.\n\n\n\n### Early to mid-20th century (1914–1946)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of France (1900–present)\n\nFrance was invaded by Germany and defended by Great Britain to start World War I in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the northeast was occupied. France and the Allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at a tremendous human and material cost. World War I left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population.[68] Between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912 to 1915 were killed.[69] The interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (e.g., annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government).\n\n\n\n![](image)French Poilus posing with their war-torn flag in 1917, during World War IIn 1940, France was invaded and quickly defeated by Nazi Germany. France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north, an Italian occupation zone in the southeast and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of the southern French metropolitan territory (two-fifths of pre-war metropolitan France) and the French empire (including French Tunisia, French Morocco, and French Algeria); the Vichy government, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory. Free France, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London.[70]\n\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews,[71] were deported to death camps and concentration camps in Germany and occupied Poland.[72] In September 1943, Corsica was the first French metropolitan territory to liberate itself from the Axis powers. On 6 June 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy, and in August they invaded Provence. Over the following year, the Allies and the French Resistance emerged victorious, and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It also made several important reforms (e.g., suffrage extended to women and the creation of a social security system).\n\n\n\n### Contemporary period (1946–present)[edit]\n\n\n![Charles de Gaulle seated in uniform looking left with folded arms](image)Charles de Gaulle, a hero of World War I, leader of the Free French during World War II, and President of France\nThe GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the Fourth Republic (1946–1958), which saw spectacular economic growth (*les Trente Glorieuses*). France was one of the founding members of NATO. France attempted to regain control of French Indochina but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954 at the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria, then treated as an integral part of France and home to over one million European settlers (Pied-Noir). During the conflict, the French systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control of Algeria.[73] This conflict wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war in France.[74]\n\n\nDuring the May 1958 crisis, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened presidency.[75] In the latter role, de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the Algerian War. The war was concluded with the Évian Accords in 1962 which led to Algerian independence. Algerian independence came at a high price: it resulted in between half a million and one million deaths and over 2 million internally displaced Algerians.[76] Around one million Pied-Noirs and Harkis fled from Algeria to France upon independence.[77] A vestige of the colonial empire are the French overseas departments and territories.\n\n\nIn the context of the Cold War, de Gaulle pursued a policy of \"national independence\" towards the Western and Eastern blocs. To this end, he withdrew from NATO's military-integrated command (while remaining within the NATO alliance), launched a nuclear development programme and made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring a Europe of sovereign nations. In the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968, the revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact. It was the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (as the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle, who resigned shortly after.[78]\n\n\nIn the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed economies in the world but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational European Union, notably by signing the Maastricht Treaty (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the eurozone in 1999 and signing the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007.[79] France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO-sponsored wars.[80]\n\n\n\n![Place de la République statue column with large French flag](image)Republican marches were organised across France after the January 2015 attacks perpetrated by Islamist terrorists; they became the largest public rallies in French history.\nSince the 19th century, France has received many immigrants. These have been mostly male foreign workers from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed.[81] During the 1970s France faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the Maghreb)[81] to permanently settle in France with their families and acquire French citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims (especially in the larger cities) living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates.[82] Simultaneously France renounced the assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French traditional values and cultural norms. They were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate.[83]\n\n\nSince the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings, France has been sporadically targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the *Charlie Hebdo* attack in January 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in French history, gathering 4.4 million people,[84] the November 2015 Paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II[85] and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004,[86] as well as the 2016 Nice truck attack, which caused 87 deaths during Bastille Day celebrations. Opération Chammal, France's military efforts to contain ISIS, killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.[87]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of France\n\n### Location and borders[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chamonix valley with the Mont Blanc at background, the highest mountain in the Alps and Western Europe on the border with Italy\nThe vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called Metropolitan France, to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. Except for the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as **l'Hexagone** (\"The Hexagon\"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° N, and longitudes 6° W and 10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west.\n\n\nMetropolitan France covers 551,500 square kilometres (212,935 sq mi),[88] the largest among European Union members.[19] France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding Adélie Land), is 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi), 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south-central and Pyrenees in the southwest.\n\n\nDue to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2 (4,261,000 sq mi), just behind the EEZ of the United States, which covers 11,351,000 km2 (4,383,000 sq mi), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia, which covers 8,148,250 km2 (3,146,000 sq mi). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world.\n\n\n\n### Geology, topography and hydrography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Geological formations near Roussillon, Vaucluse\nMetropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône Valley, allow easy communication. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft)[89] above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate.\n\n\nThe coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the Côte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[90] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders. France has 11 million square kilometres (4.2×10~~^~~6 sq mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of national parks of France, Regional natural parks of France, and Climate change in France\n\nFrance was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in 1971.[91] Although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world, France is ranked only 19th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as Canada or Australia. This is due to the country's heavy investment in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis,[92] which now accounts for 75 per cent of its electricity production[93] and results in less pollution.[94][95] According to the 2020 Environmental Performance Index conducted by Yale and Columbia, France was the fifth most environmentally conscious country in the world (behind the United Kingdom).[96][97]\n\n\nLike all European Union state members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by 2020,[98] compared to the United States' plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels.[99] As of 2009[update], French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China.[100] The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted,[101] which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually.[102] However, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses.[103]\n\n\nForests account for 31 per cent of France's land area—the fourth-highest proportion in Europe—representing an increase of 7 per cent since 1990.[104][105][106] French forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees.[107] France had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.52/10, ranking it 123rd globally out of 172 countries.[108] There are nine national parks[109] and 46 natural parks in France,[110] with the government planning to convert 20% of its exclusive economic zone into a Marine protected area by 2020.[111] A regional nature park[112] (French: *parc naturel régional* or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area.[113] A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage. The parks foster ecological research programmes and public education in the natural sciences.[114] As of 2019[update] there are 54 PNRs in France.[115]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of France\n\nThe French Republic is divided into 18 regions (located in Europe and overseas), five overseas collectivities, one overseas territory, one special collectivity – New Caledonia and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France – Clipperton.\n\n\n\n#### Regions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Departments of France\n\n![](image) Hauts-de-  \nFrance\n\nNormandy\n\nÎle-de-  \nFrance\n\nGrand Est\n\nBourgogne-  \nFranche-  \nComté\n\nCentre-  \nVal de Loire\n\nPays de   \nla Loire\n\nBrittany\n\nNouvelle-  \nAquitaine\n\nAuvergne-  \nRhône-Alpes\n\nOccitania\n\nProvence-  \nAlpes-  \nCôte d'Azur\n\nCorsica\n\nFrench Guiana\n\nGuadeloupe\n\nMartinique\n\nMayotte\n\nRéunion\n*Belgium*\n\n*Luxembourg*\n\n*Germany*\n\n*Switzerland*\n\n*Liechtenstein*\n\n*Italy*\n\n*Monaco*\n\n*United Kingdom*\n\n*Andorra*\n\n*Brazil*\n\n*Suriname*\n\n*Spain*\n*Channel*\n\n*Bay of  \nBiscay*\n\n*Ligurian  \nSea*\n\n*Mediterranean  \nSea*\n\nSince 2016, France is divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in metropolitan France (including Corsica),[116] and five overseas.[88] The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments,[117] which are numbered mainly alphabetically. The department number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle registration plates. Among the 101 French departments, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs), enjoying the same status as metropolitan departments and are thereby included in the European Union.\n\n\nThe 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons.[118] These cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.[118] Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements.\n\n\n\n#### Overseas territories and collectivities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Overseas France\n\nFurther information: Overseas collectivity and Overseas territory (France)\nIn addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna), one *sui generis* collectivity (New Caledonia), one overseas territory (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island). Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (except for St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc[119] whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.[120]\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of France\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nCurrent leaders\n![](image)\nEmmanuel Macron  \nPresident\n![](image)\nÉlisabeth Borne  \nPrime Minister\n\nFrance is a representative democracy organised as a unitary, semi-presidential republic.[121] As one of the earliest republics of the modern world, democratic traditions and values are deeply rooted in French culture, identity and politics.[122] The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958, establishing a framework consisting of executive, legislative and judicial branches.[123] It sought to address the instability of the Third and Fourth Republics by combining elements of both parliamentary and presidential systems, while greatly strengthening the authority of the executive relative to the legislature.[122]\n\n\nThe executive branch has two leaders. The President of the Republic, currently Emmanuel Macron, is the head of state, elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a five-year term.[124] The Prime Minister, currently Élisabeth Borne, is the head of government, appointed by the President to lead the government. The President has the power to dissolve Parliament or circumvent it by submitting referendums directly to the people; the President also appoints judges and civil servants, negotiates and ratifies international agreements, as well as serves as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. The Prime Minister determines public policy and oversees the civil service, with an emphasis on domestic matters.[125] In the 2022 presidential election, president Macron was re-elected.[126] 2 months later, in the June 2022 legislative elections, Macron lost his parliamentary majority and had to form a minority government.[127]\n\n\n\n![](image)Palais Bourbon, the meeting place of the National Assembly, the lower legislative chamber of the French Parliament\nThe legislature consists of the French Parliament, a bicameral body made up of a lower house, the National Assembly (*Assemblée nationale*) and an upper house, the Senate.[128] Legislators in the National Assembly, known as *députés*, represent local constituencies and are directly elected for five-year terms.[129] The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government by majority vote. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for six-year terms, with half the seats submitted to election every three years.[130] The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.[131] The parliament is responsible for determining the rules and principles concerning most areas of law, political amnesty, and fiscal policy; however, the government may draft specific details concerning most laws.\n\n\nUntil World War II, Radicals were a strong political force in France, embodied by the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party which was the most important party of the Third Republic. From World War II until 2017, French politics was dominated by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, the French Section of the Workers' International, which was succeeded by the Socialist Party (in 1969); and the other right-wing, the Gaullist Party, whose name changed over time to the Rally of the French People (1947), the Union of Democrats for the Republic (1958), the Rally for the Republic (1976), the Union for a Popular Movement (2007) and The Republicans (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, the radical centrist party La République En Marche! (LREM) became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans. LREM's opponent in the second round of the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections was the growing far-right party National Rally (RN). Since 2020, Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV) have performed well in mayoral elections in major cities[132] while on a national level, an alliance of Left parties (the NUPES) was the second-largest voting block elected to the lower house in 2022.[133] Additionally, right-wing populist RN became the largest opposition party in the National Assembly in 2022.[134]\n\n\nThe electorate is constitutionally empowered to vote on amendments passed by the Parliament and bills submitted by the president. Referendums have played a key role in shaping French politics and even foreign policy; voters have decided on such matters as Algeria's independence, the election of the president by popular vote, the formation of the EU, and the reduction of presidential term limits.[135]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of France\n\nFrance uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes;[88] judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law in a common law system). Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation wrote about the management of prisons: \"Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.\" That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.\n\n\n\n![color drawing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from 1789](image)The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\nFrench law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law. Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal *ex post facto* laws are prohibited).[136] While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State. To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the *Journal officiel de la République française*.\n\n\nFrance does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions; it has long abolished blasphemy laws and sodomy laws (the latter in 1791). However, \"offences against public decency\" (*contraires aux bonnes mœurs*) or disturbing public order (*trouble à l'ordre public*) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution.\n\n\nFrance generally has a positive reputation regarding LGBT rights.[137] Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples have been permitted, and since 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal.[138] Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881. Some consider hate speech laws in France to be too broad or severe, undermining freedom of speech.[139]\nFrance has laws against racism and antisemitism,[140] while the 1990 Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial.\n\n\nFreedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the basis for *laïcité* (state secularism): the state does not formally recognise any religion, except in Alsace-Moselle, which was part of Germany in 1905, and continues to subsidize education and clergy of Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Judaism. Nonetheless, France does recognise religious associations. The Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995 and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public; human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims.[141][142] However, it is supported by most of the population.[143]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of France\n\nFrance is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights.[144] In 2015, it was described as \"the best networked state in the world\" due to its membership in more international institutions than any other country;[145] these include the G7, World Trade Organization (WTO),[146] the Pacific Community (SPC)[147] and the Indian Ocean Commission (COI).[148] It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS)[149] and a leading member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) of 84 French-speaking countries.[150]\n\n\n\n![La Francophonie map (dozens of countries in Africa, Europe, Asia and Latin America are members of this international organisation.](image)88 states and governments are part of *La Francophonie*,[151] which promotes values of democracy, multilingualism and cultural diversity.[152] France has been a key member of this global organisation since its inception in 1970.\n![European Parliament opening in Strasbourg with crowd and many countries' flags on flagpoles](image)The European Parliament in Strasbourg (near the border with Germany). France is a founding member of all EU institutions.\nAs a significant hub for international relations, France has the third-largest assembly of diplomatic missions, second only to China and the United States, which are far more populous. It also hosts the headquarters of several international organisations, including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the OIF.[153]\n\n\nFrench foreign policy after World War II has been largely shaped by membership in the European Union, of which it was a founding member. Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.[154] In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process,[155] seeking to build its standing in continental Europe. However, since 1904, France has maintained an \"Entente cordiale\" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily.\n\n\nFrance is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but under President de Gaulle excluded itself from the joint military command, in protest of the Special Relationship between the United States and Britain, and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. Under Nicolas Sarkozy, France rejoined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.[156][157][158]\n\n\nFrance retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (*Françafrique*)[159] and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.[160] From 2012 to 2021, France and other African states intervened in support of the Malian government in the Northern Mali conflict.\n\n\nIn 2017, France was the world's fourth-largest donor of development aid in absolute terms, behind the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.[161] This represents 0.43% of its GNP, the 12th highest among the OECD.[162] Aid is provided by the governmental French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub-Saharan Africa,[163] with an emphasis on \"developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy\".[163]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French Armed Forces\n\n![](image)\nDassault Rafale of the Armée de l'Air et de l'Espace\n![](image)\n*Charles de Gaulle* aircraft carrier of the Marine nationale\n![](image)\nAMX Leclerc tank of the Armée de terre\n\nThe French Armed Forces (*Forces armées françaises*) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the President of the Republic as supreme commander. They consist of the French Army (*Armée de Terre*), the French Navy (*Marine Nationale*, formerly called *Armée de Mer*), the French Air and Space Force (*Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace*), and the National Gendarmerie (*Gendarmerie nationale*), which serves as both military police and civil police in rural areas. Together they are among the largest armed forces in the world and the largest in the EU. According to a 2018 study by Crédit Suisse, the French Armed Forces ranked as the world's sixth-most powerful military, and the second most powerful in Europe after Russia.[164] France's annual military expenditure in 2022 was US$53.6 billion, or 1.9% of its GDP, making it the eighth biggest military spender in the world.[165] There has been no national conscription since 1997.[166]\n\n\nFrance has been a recognised nuclear state since 1960. It is a party to both the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)[167] and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The French nuclear force (formerly known as \"*Force de Frappe*\") consists of four *Triomphant* class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 *ASMP* medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads;[168] 50 are deployed by the Air and Space Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's *Super Étendard Modernisé* (SEM) attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier *Charles de Gaulle*. The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved *ASMP-A* missile with a nuclear warhead.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFrance has major military industries and one of the largest aerospace sectors in the world.[169] The country has produced such equipment as the Rafale fighter, the *Charles de Gaulle* aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile and the Leclerc tank among others. France is actively investing in European joint projects such as the Eurocopter Tiger, multipurpose frigates, the UCAV demonstrator nEUROn and the Airbus A400M.[*citation needed*] France is a major arms seller,[170][171] with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market, except for nuclear-powered devices.\n\n\nOne French intelligence unit, the Directorate-General for External Security (*Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure*), is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (*Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur*) is a division of the National Police Force (*Direction générale de la Police Nationale*).[*citation needed*] France's cybersecurity capabilities are regularly ranked as some of the most robust of any nation in the world.[172][173]\n\n\nFrench weapons exported totaled 27 billion euros in 2022, up from 11.7 billion euros the previous year 2021. Additionally, the UAE alone contributed more than 16 billion euros arms to the French total.[174] Among the largest French defence companies are Dassault, Thales and Safran.[175]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of France\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n![La Défense, seen from the Eiffel Tower](image)La Défense was in 2017 ranked by Ernst & Young as the leading central business district in continental Europe, and the fourth in the world.[176]France has a mixed market economy, characterised by sizeable government involvement, and economic diversity. For roughly two centuries, the French economy has consistently ranked among the ten largest globally; it is currently the world's ninth-largest by purchasing power parity, the seventh-largest by nominal GDP, and the second-largest in the European Union by both metrics.[177] France is considered an economic power, with membership in the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Group of Twenty largest economies.\n\n\nFrance's economy is highly diversified; services represent two-thirds of both the workforce and GDP,[178] while the industrial sector accounts for a fifth of GDP and a similar proportion of employment. France is the third-biggest manufacturing country in Europe, behind Germany and Italy, and ranks eighth in the world by share of global manufacturing output, at 1.9 per cent.[179] Less than 2 per cent of GDP is generated by the primary sector, namely agriculture;[180] however, France's agricultural sector is among the largest in value and leads the EU in terms of overall production.[181]\n\n\nIn 2018, France was the fifth-largest trading nation in the world and the second-largest in Europe, with the value of exports representing over a fifth of GDP.[182] Its membership in the eurozone and the broader European single market facilitates access to capital, goods, services, and skilled labour.[183] Despite protectionist policies over certain industries, particularly in agriculture, France has generally played a leading role in fostering free trade and commercial integration in Europe to enhance its economy.[184][185] In 2019, it ranked first in Europe and 13th in the world in foreign direct investment, with European countries and the United States being leading sources.[186] According to the Bank of France (founded in 1800),[187] the leading recipients of FDI were manufacturing, real estate, finance and insurance.[188] The Paris Region has the highest concentration of multinational firms in Europe.[188]\n\n\nUnder the doctrine of *Dirigisme*, the government historically played a major role in the economy; policies such as indicative planning and nationalisation are credited for contributing to three decades of unprecedented postwar economic growth known as *Trente Glorieuses*. At its peak in 1982, the public sector accounted for one-fifth of industrial employment and over four-fifths of the credit market. Beginning in the late 20th century, France loosened regulations and state involvement in the economy, with most leading companies now being privately owned; state ownership now dominates only transportation, defence and broadcasting.[189] Policies aimed at promoting economic dynamism and privatisation have improved France's economic standing globally: it is among the world's 10 most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index,[190] and the 15th most competitive, according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report (up two places from 2018).[191]\n\n\nThe Paris stock exchange (French: *La Bourse de Paris*) is one of the oldest in the world, created by Louis XV in 1724.[192] In 2000, it merged with counterparts in Amsterdam and Brussels to form Euronext,[193] which in 2007 merged with the New York stock exchange to form NYSE Euronext, the world's largest stock exchange.[193] Euronext Paris, the French branch of NYSE Euronext, is Europe's second-largest stock exchange market, behind the London Stock Exchange. Some examples of the most valuable French companies include LVMH, L'Oréal and Sociéte Générale.[194]\n\n\nFrance has historically been one of the world's major agricultural centres and remains a \"global agricultural powerhouse\"; France is the world's sixth-biggest exporter of agricultural products, generating a trade surplus of over €7.4 billion.[195][196] Nicknamed \"the granary of the old continent\",[197] over half its total land area is farmland, of which 45 per cent is devoted to permanent field crops such as cereals. The country's diverse climate, extensive arable land, modern farming technology, and EU subsidies have made it Europe's leading agricultural producer and exporter.[198]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in France\n\n![](image)\nThe Eiffel Tower is the world's most-visited paid monument, an icon of both Paris and France.\n![](image)\nNice on the French Riviera\n![](image)\nMont-Saint-Michel and its bay were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1979.\n\nWith 89 million international tourist arrivals in 2018,[199] France is the world's top tourist destination, ahead of Spain (83 million) and the United States (80 million). However, it ranks third in tourism-derived income due to the shorter duration of visits.[200] The most popular tourist sites include (annual visitors): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Château de Versailles (2.8 million), Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (2 million), Pont du Gard (1.5 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Mont Saint-Michel (1 million), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000), Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), and Carcassonne (362,000).[201]\n\n\nFrance, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and most renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world (7.7 million visitors in 2022), the Musée d'Orsay (3.3 million), mostly devoted to Impressionism, the Musée de l'Orangerie (1.02 million), which is home to eight large Water Lily murals by Claude Monet, as well as the Centre Georges Pompidou (3 million), dedicated to contemporary art. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009.[202]\n\n\nWith more than 10 million tourists a year, the French Riviera (French: *Côte d'Azur*), in Southeast France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris Region.[203] It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometres (71 mi) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.[204]: 31 Each year the *Côte d'Azur* hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet.[204]: 66\n\n\nWith 6 million tourists a year, the castles of the Loire Valley (French: *châteaux*) and the Loire Valley itself are the third leading tourist destination in France;[205][206] this World Heritage Site is noteworthy for its architectural heritage, in its historic towns but in particular its castles, such as the Châteaux d'Amboise, de Chambord, d'Ussé, de Villandry, Chenonceau and Montsoreau. The Château de Chantilly, Versailles and Vaux-le-Vicomte, all three located near Paris, are also visitor attractions.\n\n\nFrance has 37 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, as well as rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association *Les Plus Beaux Villages de France* (literally \"The Most Beautiful Villages of France\"). The \"Remarkable Gardens\" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year.\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Energy in France\n\n![Nuclear power plant in Cattenom, France four large cooling towers expelling white water vapour against a blue sky](image)Belleville Nuclear Power Plant. France derives most of its electricity from nuclear power, the highest percentage in the world.\nFrance is the world's tenth-largest producer of electricity.[207] Électricité de France (EDF), which is majority-owned by the French government, is the country's main producer and distributor of electricity, and one of the world's largest electric utility companies, ranking third in revenue globally.[208] In 2018, EDF produced around one-fifth of the European Union's electricity, primarily from nuclear power.[209] As of 2021, France was the biggest energy exporter in Europe, mostly to the U.K. and Italy,[210] and the largest net exporter of electricity in the world.[210]\n\n\nSince the 1973 oil crisis, France has pursued a strong policy of energy security,[210] namely through heavy investment in nuclear energy. It is one of 32 countries with nuclear power plants, ranking second in the world by the number of operational nuclear reactors, at 56.[211] Consequently, 70% of France's electricity is generated by nuclear power, the highest proportion in the world by a wide margin;[212] only Slovakia and Ukraine derive a majority of electricity from nuclear power, at roughly 53% and 51%, respectively.[213] France is considered a world leader in nuclear technology, with reactors and fuel products being major exports.[210]\n\n\nDue to its overwhelming reliance on nuclear power, renewable energies have seen relatively little growth compared to other Western countries. Nevertheless, between 2008 and 2019, France's production capacity from renewable energies rose consistently and nearly doubled.[214] Hydropower is by far the leading source, accounting for over half the country's renewable energy sources[215] and contributing 13% of its electricity,[214] the highest proportion in Europe after Norway and Turkey.[215] As with nuclear power, most hydroelectric plants, such as Eguzon, Étang de Soulcem, and Lac de Vouglans, are managed by EDF.[215] France aims to further expand hydropower into 2040.[214]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in France\n\n![](image)Millau Viaduct is the tallest bridge in the world.[216]\nFrance's railway network, which stretches 29,473 kilometres (18,314 mi) as of 2008,[217] is the second most extensive in Western Europe after Germany.[218] It is operated by the SNCF, and high-speed trains include the Thalys, the Eurostar and TGV, which travels at 320 km/h (199 mph).[219] The Eurostar, along with the Eurotunnel Shuttle, connects with the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighbouring countries in Europe except Andorra. Intra-urban connections are also well developed, with most major cities having underground or tramway services complementing bus services.\n\n\nThere are approximately 1,027,183 kilometres (638,262 mi) of serviceable roadway in France, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent.[220] The Paris Region is enveloped with the densest network of roads and highways, which connect it with virtually all parts of the country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighbouring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee or road tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault, Peugeot and Citroën.[221] France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge,[222] and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie. Diesel and petrol-driven cars and lorries cause a large part of the country's air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.[223][224]\n\n\nThere are 464 airports in France.[88] Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world. Air France is the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports in France, the largest of which is in Marseille,[225] which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea.[226]12,261 kilometres (7,619 mi) of waterways traverse France including the Canal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through the Garonne river.[88]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Science and technology in France and List of French inventions and discoveries\n\n![Ariane 5 rocket](image)France is in 2020 the biggest national financial contributor to the European Space Agency,[227] which conceived the Ariane rocket family, launched from French Guiana (Ariane 5 pictured).\nSince the Middle Ages, France has been a contributor to scientific and technological achievement. In the early 11th century, the French-born Pope Sylvester II reintroduced the abacus and armillary sphere and introduced Arabic numerals and clocks to much of Europe.[228] The University of Paris, founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important academic institutions in the Western world.[229] In the 17th century, mathematician and philosopher René Descartes pioneered rationalism as a method for acquiring scientific knowledge, while Blaise Pascal became famous for his work on probability and fluid mechanics; both were key figures of the Scientific Revolution, which blossomed in Europe during this period. The French Academy of Sciences, founded in the mid-17th century by Louis XIV to encourage and protect French scientific research, was one of the earliest national scientific institutions in history.\n\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment was marked by the work of biologist Buffon, one of the first naturalists to recognise ecological succession, and chemist Lavoisier, who discovered the role of oxygen in combustion. Diderot and D'Alembert published the *Encyclopédie*, which aimed to give the public access to \"useful knowledge\" that could be applied to everyday life.[230] The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France, with Augustin Fresnel founding modern optics, Sadi Carnot laying the foundations of thermodynamics, and Louis Pasteur pioneering microbiology. Other eminent French scientists of the period have their names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. \n\n\nFamous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré; physicists Henri Becquerel, Pierre and Marie Curie, who remain famous for their work on radioactivity; physicist Paul Langevin; and virologist Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of HIV AIDS. Hand transplantation was developed in Lyon in 1998 by an international team that included Jean-Michel Dubernard, who afterward performed the first successful double hand transplant.[231] Telesurgery was first performed by French surgeons led by Jacques Marescaux on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean.[232] A face transplant was first done on 27 November 2005 by Bernard Devauchelle.[233][234] France ranked 11th in the 2023 Global Innovation Index, compared to 16th in 2019.[235][236][237][238]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of France\n\n![](image)Population density in France by arrondissement\nWith an estimated January 2023 population of 68,042,591 people,[8] France is the 20th most populous country in the world, the third-most populous in Europe (after Russia and Germany), and the second most populous in the European Union (after Germany).\n\n\nFrance is an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate of natural population growth: By birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006.[239] Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second-highest overall increase in population in the EU and was one of only four EU countries where natural births accounted for the most population growth.[240] This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973 and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010.\n\n\nAs of January 2021[update], the fertility rate declined slightly to 1.84 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1, and considerably below the high of 4.41 in 1800.[241][242][243][244] France's fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain among the highest in the EU. However, like many developed nations, the French population is aging; the average age is 41.7 years, while about a fifth of French people are 65 or over.[245] The life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years, the 12th highest in the world.\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 per cent per year;[246] since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 per cent annually.[247] Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27 per cent of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and another 24 per cent had at least one parent born outside Europe (excluding French overseas territories).[248]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French people\n\nHistorically, French people were mainly of Celtic-Gallic origin, with a significant admixture of Italic (Romans) and Germanic (Franks) groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement.[249] Through the course of the Middle Ages, France incorporated various neighbouring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced by Breton elements in the west, Aquitanian in the southwest, Scandinavian in the northwest, Alemannic in the northeast, and Ligurian in the southeast.\n\n\nLarge-scale immigration over the last century and a half have led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the French Revolution, and further codified in the French Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004, the *Institut Montaign*e estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).[250][251]\n\n\nA 2008 poll conducted jointly by the Institut national d'études démographiques and the French National Institute of Statistics[252][253] estimated that the largest ancestry groups were Italian (5 million), followed by Northwest African (3–6 million),[254][255][256] Sub-Saharan African (2.5 million), Armenian (500,000), and Turkish (200,000).[257] There are also sizeable minorities of other European ethnic groups, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.[254][258][259] France has a significant Gitan (Romani) population, numbering between 20,000 and 400,000;[260] many foreign Roma are expelled back to Bulgaria and Romania frequently.[261]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to France\n\nIt is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early 20th century;[262] between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.[263] The next largest wave came in the 1960s when around 1.6 million *pieds noirs* returned to France following the independence of its Northwest African possessions, Algeria and Morocco.[264][265] They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Calais Jungle was a refugee and illegal migrant encampment in the vicinity of Calais, France, that existed from January 2015 to October 2016.\nFrance remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.[266] In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications (albeit a 15% decrease from 2004).[267] In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications—placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world[268] and in subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017.[269] The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration,[*citation needed*] and immigration remains a contentious political issue.\n\n\nIn 2008, the INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million were of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi ancestry.[270][271][272] In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.[273]\n\n\nIn 2014, the INSEE reported a significant increase in the number of immigrants coming from Spain, Portugal and Italy between 2009 and 2012. According to the French Institute, this increase resulted from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period.[274] Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 per cent between 2009 and 2012, with the population growing from 5,300 to 11,000.[274] Of the total of 229,000 foreigners who were in France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, 5% British, 5% Spanish, 4% Italian, 4% German, 3% Romanian, and 3% Belgian.[274]\n\n\n\n### Major cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Functional area (France) and Urban unit\n\nFrance is a highly urbanised country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population in 2019[275]) being Paris (13,114,718 inh.), Lyon (2,280,845), Marseille (1,873,270), Lille (1,510,079), Toulouse (1,454,158), Bordeaux (1,363,711), Nantes (1,011,020), Strasbourg (853,110), Montpellier (801,595), and Rennes (755,668). (Note: since its 2020 revision of metropolitan area borders, INSEE considers that Nice is a metropolitan area separate from the Cannes-Antibes metropolitan area; these two combined would have a population of 1,008,296, as of the 2019 census). Rural flight was a perennial political issue throughout most of the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in France2019 census\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |\n| ![Paris](image)Paris![Lyon](image)Lyon | 1 | Paris | Île-de-France | 13,114,718 | 11 | Grenoble | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 717,469\n |\n| 2 | Lyon | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 2,280,845 | 12 | Rouen | Normandy | 705,627\n |\n| 3 | Marseille | Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur | 1,873,270 | 13 | Nice | Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur | 615,126\n |\n| 4 | Lille | Hauts-de-France | 1,510,079 | 14 | Toulon | Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur | 573,230\n |\n| 5 | Toulouse | Occitania (administrative region) | 1,454,158 | 15 | Tours | Centre-Val de Loire | 519,778\n |\n| 6 | Bordeaux | Nouvelle-Aquitaine | 1,363,711 | 16 | Nancy | Grand Est | 510,306\n |\n| 7 | Nantes | Pays de la Loire | 1,011,020 | 17 | Clermont-Ferrand | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 507,479\n |\n| 8 | Strasbourg | Grand Est | 853,110 | 18 | Saint-Étienne | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 498,849\n |\n| 9 | Montpellier | Occitania (administrative region) | 801,595 | 19 | Caen | Normandy | 472,161\n |\n| 10 | Rennes | Brittany | 755,668 | 20 | Orléans | Centre-Val de Loire | 451,373\n |\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: French language, Languages of France, and Organisation internationale de la Francophonie\n\n![world map of French speaking countries](image)Map of the Francophone world: Native language\n Administrative language\n Secondary or cultural language\n\nThe official language of France is French,[276] a Romance language derived from Latin. Since 1635, the Académie française has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as Occitan, Breton, Catalan, Flemish (Dutch dialect), Alsatian (German dialect), Basque, and Corsican (Italian dialect). Italian was the official language of Corsica until 9 May 1859.[277]\n\n\nThe Government of France does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. The perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French overseas territories. It is estimated that between 300 million[278] and 500 million[279] people worldwide can speak French, either as a mother tongue or as a second language.\n\n\nAccording to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried out in France by the INSEE and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French was the native language of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000). Native speakers of other languages made up the remaining 5.2% of the population.[280]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in France\n\n![Notre-Dame de Reims façade, gothic stone cathedral against blue sky](image)Notre-Dame de Reims is the Roman Catholic cathedral where the Kings of France were crowned until 1825.[XIII]\nFrance is a secular country in which freedom of religion is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of *laïcité*, a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular. The exception to this is the region of Alsace and Moselle where Lutheranism, Catholicism and Judaism enjoy official status and state funding.\n\n\nAccording to a survey held in 2016 by Institut Montaigne and Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian, 39.6% had no religion (atheism or agnosticism), 5.6% were Muslims, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith.[281] Estimates of the number of Muslims in France vary widely. In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8–10%).[282][283] The current Jewish community in France is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world after Israel and the United States, ranging between 480,000 and 600,000, about 0.8% of the population as of 2016.[281]\n\n\nCatholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practised today as it was. Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic.[284] During the French Revolution, activists conducted a brutal campaign of de-Christianisation, ending the Catholic Church as the state religion. In some cases, clergy and churches were attacked, with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornaments. After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, in 1905 France passed the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which established the principle of *laïcité*.[285]\n\n\nTo this day, the government is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle). It recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policymaking.[286]\n\n\nCertain groups, such as Scientology, Children of God, the Unification Church, or the Order of the Solar Temple are considered cults (\"*sectes*\" in French); therefore they do not have the same status as recognised religions in France.[287] *Secte* is considered a pejorative term in France.[288]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in France\n\n![Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, stone building with slate dome](image)The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, a teaching hospital in Paris, is one of Europe's largest hospitals.[289]\nThe French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the \"close to best overall health care\" in the world.[290] The French health care system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997.[291][292] In 2011, France spent 11.6% of its GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,[293] a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but less than in the United States. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government-funded agencies.[294]\n\n\nCare is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases (*affections de longues durées*) such as cancer, AIDS or cystic fibrosis. The life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women, one of the highest in the European Union and the World.[295][296] There are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in France,[297] and average health care spending per capita was US$4,719 in 2008.[298]\nAs of 2007[update], approximately 140,000 inhabitants (0.4%) of France are living with HIV/AIDS.[88]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in France\n\n![](image)The ENS produces among the most Nobel Prize laureates per capita in the world.[299]\nIn 1802, Napoleon created the lycée, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession.[300] Nevertheless, Jules Ferry is considered the father of the French modern school, leading reforms in the late 19th century that established free, secular and compulsory education (currently mandatory until the age of 16).[301][302]\n\n\nFrench education is centralised and divided into three stages: Primary, secondary, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as near the OECD average in 2018.[303][304] France was one of the PISA-participating countries where school children perceived some of the lowest levels of support and feedback from their teachers.[304] Schoolchildren in France reported greater concern about the disciplinary climate and behaviour in classrooms compared to other OECD countries.[304]\n\n\nHigher education is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective *Grandes écoles*, such as Sciences Po Paris for Political studies, HEC Paris for Economics, Polytechnique, the École des hautes études en sciences sociales for Social studies and the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris that produce high-profile engineers, or the École nationale d'administration for careers in the Grands Corps of the state. The *Grandes écoles* have been criticised for alleged elitism, producing many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs and politicians.[305]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of France\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French art\n\n![](image)Claude Monet, founder of the Impressionist movement\nThe origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance firsthand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of the Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy. \n\n\nFrench artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of the old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism.\n\n\nIn the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting grew, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir.[306] The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,[307] as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.[308][309]\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Vincent van Gogh, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Wassily Kandinsky.\n\n\nThere are many art museums in France, the most famous of which being the state-owned Musée du Louvre, which collects artwork from the 18th century and earlier. The Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).[310][311] It was voted the best museum in the world in 2018.[312] Modern works are presented in the Musée National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou. These three state-owned museums are visited by close to 17 million people a year.[313]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French architecture\n\n![Sainte Chapelle interior showing painted stonework vaulting and stained glass](image)Saint Louis's Sainte-Chapelle represents the French impact on religious architecture.\nDuring the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Château d'Angers, the massive Château de Vincennes and the so-called Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe.\n\n\nGothic architecture, originally named *Opus Francigenum* meaning \"French work\",[314] was born in Île-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be imitated throughout Europe.[315] Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims.[316]\n\n\nThe final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley, from 1450 as a first reference the Château de Montsoreau.[317] Examples of such residential castles include the Château de Chambord, the Château de Chenonceau, or the Château d'Amboise.\n\n\nFollowing the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found greater success in the secular domain than in the religious one.[318] In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architects of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides.[319] Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.[320][321]\n\n\nAfter the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although it was introduced in France before the revolution with such buildings as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire-style architecture.[322] Under Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; most notably, Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated with this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as the Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\nIn the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 metres (121 ft).[323] France's largest financial district is La Défense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.[324] Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc and Paul Andreu.\n\n\n\n### Literature and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: French literature and French philosophy\n\nThe earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts, such as *Tristan and Iseult* and *Lancelot-Grail* are unknown. Three famous medieval authors are Chrétien de Troyes, Christine de Pizan (langue d'oïl), and Duke William IX of Aquitaine (langue d'oc). Much medieval French poetry and literature was inspired by the legends of the Carolingian cycle, such as *The Song of Roland* and the various chansons de geste. The *Roman de Renart*, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character Reynard ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was François Rabelais, who wrote five popular early picaresque novels. Rabelais was also in regular communication with Marguerite de Navarre, author of the *Heptameron*.[325] Another 16th-century author was Michel de Montaigne, whose most famous work, *Essais*, started a literary genre.[326]\n\n\nFrench literature and poetry flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot's best-known works are *Jacques the Fatalist* and *Rameau's Nephew*. He is best known, however, as the main editor of the *Encyclopédie*, whose aim was, to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, and philosophy) and to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of children's fairy tales including *Puss in Boots*, *Cinderella*, *Sleeping Beauty* and *Bluebeard*. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé.[327]\n\n\nThe 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as \"the greatest French writer of all time\"[328] for excelling in all literary genres. The preface of his play *Cromwell* is considered to be the manifesto of the Romantic movement. *Les Contemplations* and *La Légende des siècles* are considered \"poetic masterpieces\",[329] Hugo's verse has been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer.[329] His novel *Les Misérables* is widely seen as one of the greatest novels ever written[330] and *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* has remained immensely popular. Other major authors of that century include Alexandre Dumas (*The Three Musketeers* and *The Count of Monte-Cristo*), Jules Verne (*Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*), Émile Zola (*Les Rougon-Macquart*), Honoré de Balzac (*La Comédie humaine*), Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gautier and Stendhal (*The Red and the Black*, *The Charterhouse of Parma*), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world.\n\n\nIn the early 20th century France was a haven for literary freedom.[331] Works banned for obscenity in the US, the UK and other Anglophone nations were published in France decades before they were available in the respective authors' home countries.[331] The French were disinclined to punish literary figures for their writing, and prosecutions were rare.[331] Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Jean Cocteau, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint Exupéry wrote *The Little Prince*, which has remained popular for decades and is one of the best selling books in history.[332][333]\n\n\nMedieval philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism until the emergence of Humanism in the Renaissance. Modern philosophy began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of René Descartes, Blaise Pascal and Nicolas Malebranche. Descartes was the first Western philosopher since ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors.[334][335] France in the 18th Century saw major philipshocial contributions from Voltaire who came to embody the Enlightenment and Jean-Jacques Rousseau whose work highly influenced the French Revolution.[336][337] French philosophers made major contributions to the field in the 20th century including the existentialist works of Simone de Beauvoir, Camus, and Sartre.[338] Other influential contributions during this time include the moral and political works of Simone Weil, contributions to structuralism including from Claude Lévi-Strauss and the post-structuralist works by Michel Foucault.[339][340]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of France\n\n![](image)Claude Debussy\nFrance has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed many talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer of the harpsichord.[341][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nÉrik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his *Gymnopédies*.[*citation needed*] Francis Poulenc's best-known works are his piano suite *Trois mouvements perpétuels* (1919), the ballet *Les biches* (1923), the *Concert champêtre* (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera *Dialogues des Carmélites* (1957) and the *Gloria* (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.[342] Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms[343][344][345][346] and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as *Jeux d'eau*, *Miroirs*, *Le tombeau de Couperin* and *Gaspard de la nuit*, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the *Rapsodie espagnole*, *Daphnis et Chloé*, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's *Pictures at an Exhibition* and his orchestral work *Boléro* (1928). More recently, in the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolution of contemporary classical music.[347]\n\n\nFrench music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music in the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as *chanson française*, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg.[348] Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries,[349] bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira,[350] or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity.\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of France\n\n![Palme d'Or award in presentation case](image)A *Palme d'Or* from the Cannes Film Festival, one of the \"Big Three\" film festivals alongside the Venice Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival[351][352][353]\nFrance has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the Lumière Brothers) credited with creating cinema in 1895.[354] The world's first female filmmaker, Alice Guy-Blaché, was also from France.[355] Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the Government of France. France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2015[update] producing more films than any other European country.[356][357] The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.[358][359]\n\n\nApart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé, Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke) and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur or Francis Veber in the United States. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.[360] French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK.[360] In 2013 France was the second greatest exporter of films in the world, after the United States.[361]\n\n\nAs part of its advocacy of cultural exception, a political concept of treating culture differently from other commercial products,[362] France succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993.[363] Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a vote by UNESCO in 2005: the principle of \"cultural exception\" won an overwhelming victory with 198 countries voting for it and only 2 countries, the United States and Israel, voting against it.[364]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French fashion\n\n![Chanel's headquarters storefront window at the Place Vendôme Paris with awning](image)Chanel's headquarters on Place Vendôme, Paris\nFashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern \"haute couture\" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.\n\n\nThe association of France with fashion and style (French: *la mode*) dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV[365] when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (French: *couture or haute couture*) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishment of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. The French perfume industry is the world leader in its sector and is centred on the town of Grasse.[366]\n\n\nAccording to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor.[367] Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH, Kering SA, L'Oréal), more than any other country in the world.[367]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in France\n\n![](image)*Le Figaro* was founded in 1826 and it is still considered a newspaper of record.[368]\nIn 2021, regional daily newspapers (like *Ouest-France*, *Sud Ouest*, *La Voix du Nord*, *Dauphiné Libéré*, *Le Télégramme*, and *Le Progrès*) more than doubled the sales of national newspapers (like *Le Monde*, *Le Figaro*, *L'Équipe* (sports), *Le Parisien*, and *Les Echos* (finance). Free dailies, distributed in metropolitan centers, continue to increase their market share.[369] The sector of weekly magazines includes more than 400 specialised weekly magazines published in the country.[370]\n\n\nThe most influential news magazines are the left-wing *Le Nouvel Observateur*, centrist *L'Express* and right-wing *Le Point* (in 2009 more than 400,000 copies),[371] but the highest circulation numbers for weeklies are attained by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them *Marie Claire* and *ELLE*, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers *Le Canard Enchaîné* and *Charlie Hebdo*, as well as *Paris Match*. As in most industrialised nations, the print media have been affected by a severe crisis with the rise of the internet. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent,[372][373] but in 2009 it had to give 600,000 euros to help the print media cope with the economic crisis, in addition to existing subsidies.[374]\nIn 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations[375][376] remained under state control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending the state monopoly on radio.[376]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French cuisine\n\n![](image)French wines are usually made to accompany French cuisine.\nFrench cuisine is renowned for being one of the finest in the world.[377][378] Different regions have different styles. In the North, butter and cream are common ingredients, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the South.[379] Each region of France has traditional specialties: cassoulet in the Southwest, choucroute in Alsace, quiche in the Lorraine region, beef bourguignon in Burgundy, provençal tapenade, etc. France is most famous for its wines,[380] and cheeses, which are often named for the territory where they are produced (AOC).[381][382] A meal typically consists of three courses, *entrée* (starter), *plat principal* (main course), and *fromage* (cheese) or *dessert*, sometimes with a salad served before the cheese or dessert.\n\n\nFrench cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the quality of life and the attractiveness of France. A French publication, the Michelin guide, awards *Michelin stars* for excellence to a select few establishments.[383][384] The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants.[385]\n\n\nIn addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine. French rum is made in distilleries located on islands in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.[386][387]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in France\n\n![The peloton in the streets of Nice during the 2nd stage of the Tour de France on 30 August 2020](image)Starting in 1903, the Tour de France is the oldest and most prestigious of Grands Tours, and the world's most famous cycling race.[388]\nFrance hosts \"the world's biggest annual sporting event\", the Tour de France.[389] Other popular sports played in France include: football, judo, tennis,[390] rugby union[391] and pétanque. France has hosted events such as the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups,[392] the 2007 Rugby World Cup,[393] and will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The country also hosted the 1960 European Nations' Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, UEFA Euro 2016 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1923, France is famous for its 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race.[394] Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including the Paris Masters and the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. French martial arts include Savate and Fencing.\n\n![](image)Zidane was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in a 2004 UEFA poll.[395]\nFrance has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games' revival, at the end of the 19th century.[396][397] After Athens was awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics' Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Games in 1900.[398] Paris was the first home of the International Olympic Committee, before it moved to Lausanne.[399] Since 1900, France has hosted the Olympics on 4 further occasions: the 1924 Summer Olympics, again in Paris[397] and three Winter Games (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble and 1992 in Albertville).[397] Similar to the Olympics, France introduced Olympics for the deaf people (Deaflympics) in 1924 with the idea of a French deaf car mechanic, Eugène Rubens-Alcais who paved the way to organise the inaugural edition of the Summer Deaflympics in Paris.[400]\n\n\nBoth the national football team and the national rugby union team are nicknamed \"*Les Bleus*\" in reference to the team's shirt colour as well as the national French tricolour flag. Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players and over 18,000 registered clubs.[401]\n\n\nThe French Open, also called Roland-Garros, is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments.[402]\n\n\nRugby union is popular, particularly in Paris and the southwest of France.[403] The national rugby union team has competed at every Rugby World Cup; it takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* Outline of France\n\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The current Constitution of France does not specify a national emblem.[1] The lictor's fasces is very often used to represent the French Republic, although today it holds no official status.[2] In addition to the coat of arms, France also uses a different emblem for diplomatic and consular purposes.\n2. **^** For information about regional languages, see Languages of France.\n3. **^** European Union since 1993\n4. **^** French National Geographic Institute data, which includes bodies of water\n5. **^** French Land Register data, which exclude lakes, ponds and glaciers larger than 1 km2 (0.386 sq mi or 247 acres) as well as the estuaries of rivers\n6. **^** Whole of the except the overseas territories in the Pacific Ocean\n7. **^** French overseas territories in the Pacific Ocean only\n8. **^** Time zones across the span from UTC−10 (French Polynesia) to UTC+12 (Wallis and Futuna)\n9. **^** Daylight saving time is observed in metropolitan France and Saint Pierre and Miquelon only.\n10. **^** The overseas regions and collectivities form part of the French telephone numbering plan, but have their own country calling codes: Guadeloupe +590; Martinique +596; French Guiana +594; Réunion and Mayotte +262; Saint Pierre and Miquelon +508.

It is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the most populous member state of the European Union. Germany is situated between the Baltic and North seas to the north, and the Alps to the south. Its 16 constituent states are bordered by Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr.\n\n\nVarious Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.\n\n\nFormal unification of Germany into the modern nation-state was commenced on 18 August 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North German Confederation later transformed in 1871 into the German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was in turn transformed into the semi-presidential Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, in 1949, Germany as a whole was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, known as East Germany, while Berlin continued its *de jure* Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of communist led-government in East Germany, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990.\n\n\nGermany has been described as a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe, the world's third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer. As a developed country it offers social security, a universal health care system and a tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, European Union, NATO, Council of Europe, G7, G20, and OECD. It has the third-greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of Germany, Germani, and Germania\n\nThe English word *Germany* derives from the Latin *Germania*, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[12] The German term *Deutschland*, originally *diutisciu land* ('the German lands') is derived from *deutsch* (cf. *Dutch*), descended from Old High German *diutisc* 'of the people' (from *diot* or *diota* 'people'), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic \\**þiudiskaz* 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form *Theodiscus*), derived from \\**þeudō*, descended from Proto-Indo-European \\**tewtéh₂-* 'people', from which the word *Teutons* also originates.[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Germany\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of German history.\n\nPre-human ancestors, the *Danuvius guggenmosi*, who were present in Germany over 11 million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest ones to walk on two legs.[14] Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.[15] The first non-modern human fossil (the Neanderthal) was discovered in the Neander Valley.[16] Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the Swabian Jura, including 42,000-year-old flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[17] the 40,000-year-old Lion Man,[18] and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels.[19] The Nebra sky disk, created during the European Bronze Age, has been attributed to a German site.[20]\n\n\n\n### Germanic tribes and the Frankish Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Jastorf culture, Germanic peoples, Germania, Migration Period, and Frankish Realm\n\n![](image)A model of Augusta Treverorum, part of the Roman Empire in the 4th century\nThe Germanic peoples are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age, early Iron Age, or the Jastorf culture.[21][22] From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the Celtic, Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes.[23]\n\n\nUnder Augustus, the Roman Empire began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of Germania between the Rhine and Elbe rivers. In 9 AD, three Roman legions were defeated by Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.[24] The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania, and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history.[25] By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote *Germania*, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of modern Germany. However, Baden-Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been incorporated into Roman provinces.[26][27][28]\n\n\nAround 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[29] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria, and areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes.[26]\n\n\n\n\n### East Francia and the Holy Roman Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: East Francia and Holy Roman Empire\n\n![](image)East Francia in 843\n![](image)Martin Luther, born in Eisleben in 1483, challenged the indulgences of the Catholic Church, giving rise to the Reformation and Protestantism.\nCharlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843.[30] The eastern successor kingdom of East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[30] Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies.[31] In 996, Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture controversy.[32]\n\n\nUnder the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (*Ostsiedlung*).[33] Members of the Hanseatic League, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[34] The population declined starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–1350.[35] The Golden Bull issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors.[36]\n\n\nJohannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge.[37] In 1517, Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation and his translation of the Bible began the standardization of the language; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the \"Evangelical\" faith (Lutheranism), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects (*cuius regio, eius religio*).[38] From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.[39][40]\n\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates;[39] their mostly German-speaking rulers were able to choose Catholicism, Lutheranism, or Calvinism as their official religion.[41] The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet.[42] The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of the Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as empress consort when her husband, Francis I, became emperor.[43][44]\n\n\nFrom 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland.[45][46] During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the *Imperium* was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.[47]\n\n\n\n### German Confederation and Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German question, German Confederation, Unification of Germany, German Empire, and German colonial empire\n\n![](image)The German Confederation in 1815\nFollowing the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the emperor of Austria as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of Prussia's rising influence. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich.[48][49] The *Zollverein*, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[50] In light of revolutionary movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the German question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.[51]\n\n\nKing William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the war with Denmark in 1864; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austria. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser, and Berlin became its capital.[52][53]\n\n\nIn the *Gründerzeit* period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as chancellor of Germany secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[53] However, under Wilhelm II, Germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[54] A dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary; the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[55] At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.[56] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and China.[57] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), from 1904 to 1907, carried out the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples as punishment for an uprising;[58][59] this was the 20th century's first genocide.[59]\n\n\nThe assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[60] a general armistice ended the fighting. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Emperor Wilhelm II and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and Germany was declared a federal republic. Germany's new leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, accepting defeat by the Allies. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.[61] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific.[62]\n\n\n\n### Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany\n\n![](image)Adolf Hitler, dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945\n![](image)A map of German-occupied Europe in 1942 during World War II with areas controlled by the German Reich shown in bold black\nOn 11 August 1919, President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.[63] In the subsequent struggle for power, communists seized power in Bavaria, but conservative elements elsewhere attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putsch. Street fighting in the major industrial centres, the occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops, and a period of hyperinflation followed. A debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.[64][65][66]\n\n\nThe worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929. Chancellor Heinrich Brüning's government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused unemployment of nearly 30% by 1932.[67] The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after a special election in 1932 and Hindenburg appointed Hitler as chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.[68] After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights and the first Nazi concentration camp opened.[69][70] On 23 March 1933, the Enabling Act gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution,[71] and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations, and dramatically increased the country's rearmament.[72] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the *Autobahn*.[73]\n\n\nIn 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.[74] Germany also reacquired control of the Saarland in 1935,[75] remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement, and in violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939.[76] *Kristallnacht* (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.[77]\n\n\nIn August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.[78] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, beginning World War II in Europe;[79] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[80] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, forcing the French government to sign an armistice. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the Allied reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe; the Western allies landed in France and entered Germany despite a final German counteroffensive. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, Germany signed the surrender document on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe[79][81] and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.[82][83]\n\n\nIn what later became known as the Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across Europe. In total 17 million people were systematically murdered, including 6 million Jews, at least 130,000 Romani, 275,000 disabled people, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents.[84] Nazi policies in German-occupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7 million Poles,[85] 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and 3.5 million Soviet prisoners of war.[86][82] German military casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million,[87] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[88] Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.[89]\n\n\n\n### East and West Germany[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Germany (1945–1990), Allied-occupied Germany, West Germany, and East Germany\n\n![](image)A map of Germany in 1947, following the end of World War II, including American, Soviet, British, and French occupation zones and the French-controlled Saar Protectorate. Territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union under the terms of the Potsdam Conference.[90]\nAfter Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies *de jure* abolished German state and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (German: *Bundesrepublik Deutschland*); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (German: *Deutsche Demokratische Republik*; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[91] East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.[92]\n\n\nWest Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American Marshall Plan.[93] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor of Germany in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (*Wirtschaftswunder*) beginning in the early 1950s.[94] West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community.[95] On 1 January 1957, the Saarland joined West Germany.[96]\n\n\nEast Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the Soviet Union via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (*Politbüro*) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service.[97] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[98] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the Cold War.[99]\n\n\nTensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's *Ostpolitik*.[100] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open its border with Austria, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the *Wende* reform process culminating in the *Two Plus Four Treaty* under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.[101] The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, German reunification and *Die Wende* (\"the turning point\").[102]\n\n\n\n### Reunified Germany and the European Union[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German reunification and History of Germany since 1990\n\n![](image)The Berlin Wall during its fall in 1989 and the Brandenburg Gate (background) was one of the first developments in the end of the Cold War, leading ultimately to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nUnited Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of West Germany so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[103] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act (1994), Berlin again became the capital of Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a *Bundesstadt* (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.[104] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.[105][106]\n\n\nSince reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007,[107] and co-founding the eurozone.[108] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.[109][110]\n\n\nIn the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan.[111] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (*Energiewende*) for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.[112] During the 2015 European migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.[113]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Germany\n\n![](image)A physical map of Germany\nGermany is the seventh-largest country in Europe;[4] bordering Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria to the southeast, and Switzerland to the south-southwest. France, Luxembourg and Belgium are situated to the west, with the Netherlands to the northwest. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,022 km2 (137,847 sq mi), consisting of 348,672 km2 (134,623 sq mi) of land and 8,350 km2 (3,224 sq mi) of water.\n\n\nElevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (*Nordsee*) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (*Ostsee*) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[114]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.[4]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMost of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north and west to continental in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.[115]\n\n\nFrom February 2019–2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C (37.9 °F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in June 2019.[116] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[117] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[118]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Berchtesgaden National Park in Bavaria\nThe territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial ecoregions: Atlantic mixed forests, Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, Western European broadleaf forests, and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[119] As of 2016[update] 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.[120]\n\n\nPlants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are conifers, particularly spruce and pine.[121] There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.[122] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.[123]\n\n\nThe 16 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park.[124] In addition, there are 17 Biosphere Reserves,[125] and 105 nature parks.[126] More than 400 zoos and animal parks operate in Germany.[127] The Berlin Zoo, which opened in 1844, is the oldest in Germany, and claims the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.[128]\n\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Germany, Taxation in Germany, and Federal budget of Germany\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Frank-Walter SteinmeierPresident(representative head of state) | Olaf ScholzChancellor(head of government) |\n\n\nGermany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the *Bundestag* (Federal Diet) and *Bundesrat* (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The *Bundestag* is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the *Bundesrat* represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[4] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the *Grundgesetz* (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the *Bundestag* and the *Bundesrat*; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.[129]\n\n\nThe president, currently Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the *Bundesversammlung* (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the *Bundestag* and an equal number of state delegates.[4] The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the *Bundestagspräsident* (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the *Bundestag* and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[130] The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the *Bundespräsident* after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the *Bundestag*.[4] The chancellor, currently Olaf Scholz, is the head of government and exercises executive power through his Cabinet.[4]\n\n\nSince 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party The Left has been a staple in the German *Bundestag*, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### Constituent states[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: States of Germany, Federalism in Germany, and List of current Minister-presidents of the German federal states\n\nGermany is a federation and comprises sixteen constituent states which are collectively referred to as *Länder*.[133] Each state (*Land*) has its own constitution,[134] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.[133] As of 2017[update] Germany is divided into 401 districts (*Kreise*) at a municipal level; these consist of 294 rural districts and 107 urban districts.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![Lower Saxony](image) Lower Saxony\n\n![Free Hanseatic City of Bremen](image) Bremen\n\n![Hamburg](image) Hamburg\n\n![Mecklenburg-Vorpommern](image) Mecklenburg-  \nVorpommern\n\n![Saxony-Anhalt](image) Saxony-  \nAnhalt\n\n![Saxony](image) Saxony\n\n![Brandenburg](image) Brandenburg\n\n![Berlin](image) Berlin\n\n![Thuringia](image) Thuringia\n\n![Hesse](image) Hesse\n\n![North Rhine-Westphalia](image) North Rhine-  \nWestphalia\n\n![Rhineland-Palatinate](image) Rhineland-Palatinate\n\n![Bavaria](image) Bavaria\n\n![Baden-Württemberg](image) Baden-  \nWürttemberg\n\n![Saarland](image) Saarland\n\n![Schleswig-Holstein](image) Schleswig-Holstein\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| State | Capital | Area (km2)[136] | Population (2018)[137] | Nominal GDP billions EUR (2015)[138] | Nominal GDP per capita EUR (2015)[138] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baden-Württemberg | Stuttgart | 35,751 | 11,069,533 | 461 | 42,800\n |\n| Bavaria | Munich | 70,550 | 13,076,721 | 550 | 43,100\n |\n| Berlin | Berlin | 892 | 3,644,826 | 125 | 35,700\n |\n| Brandenburg | Potsdam | 29,654 | 2,511,917 | 66 | 26,500\n |\n| Bremen | Bremen | 420 | 682,986 | 32 | 47,600\n |\n| Hamburg | Hamburg | 755 | 1,841,179 | 110 | 61,800\n |\n| Hesse | Wiesbaden | 21,115 | 6,265,809 | 264 | 43,100\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | Schwerin | 23,214 | 1,609,675 | 40 | 25,000\n |\n| Lower Saxony | Hanover | 47,593 | 7,982,448 | 259 | 32,900\n |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | Düsseldorf | 34,113 | 17,932,651 | 646 | 36,500\n |\n| Rhineland-Palatinate | Mainz | 19,854 | 4,084,844 | 132 | 32,800\n |\n| Saarland | Saarbrücken | 2,569 | 990,509 | 35 | 35,400\n |\n| Saxony | Dresden | 18,416 | 4,077,937 | 113 | 27,800\n |\n| Saxony-Anhalt | Magdeburg | 20,452 | 2,208,321 | 57 | 25,200\n |\n| Schleswig-Holstein | Kiel | 15,802 | 2,896,712 | 86 | 31,200\n |\n| Thuringia | Erfurt | 16,202 | 2,143,145 | 57 | 26,400\n |\n| Germany | Berlin | 357,386 | 83,019,213 | 3025 | 37,100\n |\n\n |\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law of Germany, Judiciary of Germany, and Law enforcement in Germany\n\nGermany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law.[139] The *Bundesverfassungsgericht* (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.[140] Germany's supreme court system is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Fiscal Court and the Federal Administrative Court.[141]\n\n\nCriminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the *Strafgesetzbuch* and the *Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch* respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.[142] Except for petty crimes, which are tried before a single professional judge, and serious political crimes, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges (*Schöffen*) sit side by side with professional judges.[143][144]\n\n\nGermany has a low murder rate with 1.18 murders per 100,000 as of 2016[update].[145] In 2018, the overall crime rate fell to its lowest since 1992.[146]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage has been legal in Germany since 2017, and LGBT rights are generally protected in the nation.[147]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Germany\n\n![](image)Germany hosted the 2022 G7 summit at Schloss Elmau in Bavaria.\nGermany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad[148] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.[149] Germany is a member of NATO, the OECD, the G7, the G20, the World Bank and the IMF. It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[150][151][152] The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[153] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism.[154] After 1990, Germany and Russia worked together to establish a \"strategic partnership\" in which energy development became one of the most important factors. As a result of the cooperation, Germany imported most of its natural gas and crude oil from Russia.[155][156]\n\n\nThe development policy of Germany is an independent area of foreign policy. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[157] It was the world's second-biggest aid donor in 2019 after the United States.[158]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bundeswehr\n\n![](image)A German TPz Fuchs armoured personnel carrier\nGermany's military, the *Bundeswehr* (Federal Defence), is organised into the *Heer* (Army and special forces KSK), *Marine* (Navy), *Luftwaffe* (Air Force), *Zentraler Sanitätsdienst der Bundeswehr* (Joint Medical Service), *Streitkräftebasis* (Joint Support Service) and *Cyber- und Informationsraum* (Cyber and Information Domain Service) branches. In absolute terms, German military expenditure is the eighth-highest in the world.[159] In 2018, military spending was at $49.5 billion, about 1.2% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%.[160][161] However, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that German military expenditure would be increased past the NATO target of 2%, along with a one-time 2022 infusion of 100 billion euros, representing almost double the 53 billion euro military budget for 2021.[162][163]\n\n\nAs of January 2020[update], the *Bundeswehr* has a strength of 184,001 active soldiers and 80,947 civilians.[164] Reservists are available to the armed forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[165] Until 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, but this has been officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.[166][167] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.[168] According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Germany was the fourth-largest exporter of major arms in the world from 2014 to 2018.[169]\n\n\nIn peacetime, the *Bundeswehr* is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the *Bundeswehr*.[170] The role of the *Bundeswehr* is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994, the term \"defence\" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017,[update] the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against Daesh, 980 in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, and 800 in Kosovo.[171][172]\n\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Germany and Science and technology in Germany\n\n![](image)Frankfurt, a leading business centre in Europe and the seat of the European Central Bank[173]\n![](image)A Blockupy movement demonstration in front of the European Central Bank in 2014\nGermany has a social market economy with a highly skilled labour force, a low level of corruption, and a high level of innovation.[4][174][175] It is the world's third-largest exporter and third-largest importer,[4] and has the largest economy in Europe, which is also the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP,[176] and the fifth-largest by PPP.[177] Its GDP per capita measured in purchasing power standards amounts to 121% of the EU27 average.[178] The service sector contributes approximately 69% of the total GDP, industry 31%, and agriculture 1% as of 2017[update].[4] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat amounts to 3.2% as of January 2020[update], which is the fourth-lowest in the EU.[179]\n\n\nGermany is part of the European single market which represents more than 450 million consumers.[180] In 2017, the country accounted for 28% of the eurozone economy according to the International Monetary Fund.[181] Germany introduced the common European currency, the euro, in 2002.[182] Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is headquartered in Frankfurt.[183][173]\n\n\nBeing home to the modern car, the automotive industry in Germany is regarded as one of the most competitive and innovative in the world,[184] and is the sixth-largest by production as of 2021. Germany is home to Volkswagen Group, the world's second-largest automotive manufacturer in 2022 by both vehicle production[185] and sales,[186] and is the third-largest exporter of cars as of 2023.[187]\n\n\nThe top ten exports of Germany are vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical equipments, pharmaceuticals, transport equipments, basic metals, food products, and rubber and plastics.[188]\n\n\nOf the world's 500 largest stock-market-listed companies measured by revenue in 2019, the Fortune Global 500, 29 are headquartered in Germany.[189] 30 major Germany-based companies are included in the DAX, the German stock market index which is operated by Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[190] Well-known international brands include Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, Siemens, Allianz, Adidas, Porsche, Bosch and Deutsche Telekom.[191] Berlin is a hub for startup companies and has become the leading location for venture capital funded firms in the European Union.[192] Germany is recognised for its large portion of specialised small and medium enterprises, known as the *Mittelstand* model.[193] These companies represent 48% of the global market leaders in their segments, labelled hidden champions.[194]\n\n\nResearch and development efforts form an integral part of the German economy.[195] In 2018, Germany ranked fourth globally in terms of number of science and engineering research papers published.[196] Research institutions in Germany include the Max Planck Society, the Helmholtz Association, and the Fraunhofer Society and the Leibniz Association.[197] Germany is the largest contributor to the European Space Agency.[198] Germany was ranked 8th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[199]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in Germany, Energy in Germany, Telecommunications in Germany, and Water supply and sanitation in Germany\n\n![](image)An ICE 3 train on the Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line, with operating speed up to 300 km/h (190 mph)\nWith its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent.[200] Its road network is among the densest in Europe.[201] The motorway (Autobahn) is widely known for having no general federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[202] The Intercity Express or *ICE* train network serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph).[203] The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport.[204] The Port of Hamburg is one of the twenty largest container ports in the world.[205]\n\n\nIn 2019[update], Germany was the world's seventh-largest consumer of energy.[206] All nuclear power plants were phased out in 2023.[207] It meets the country's power demands using 40% renewable sources, and it has been called an \"early leader\" in solar and offshore wind.[208][209] Germany is committed to the Paris Agreement and several other treaties promoting biodiversity, low emission standards, and water management.[210][211][212] The country's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world—at around 65%.[213] The country's greenhouse gas emissions per capita were the ninth-highest in the EU in 2018[update], but these numbers have been trending downward.[214][215] The German energy transition (*Energiewende*) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy.[216][209]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Germany\n\n![](image)Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria\nGermany is the ninth-most visited country in the world as of 2017[update], with 37.4 million visits.[217] Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over €105.3 billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry supports 4.2 million jobs.[218]\n\n\nGermany's most visited and popular landmarks include Cologne Cathedral, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, the Dresden Frauenkirche, Neuschwanstein Castle, Heidelberg Castle, the Wartburg, and Sanssouci Palace.[219] The Europa-Park near Freiburg is Europe's second-most popular theme park resort.[220]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Germany and Germans\n\n![](image)A bilingual street sign in both German and Lower Sorbian in Cottbus in Brandenburg\nWith a population of 80.2 million according to the 2011 German Census,[221] rising to 83.7 million as of 2022[update],[222] Germany is the most populous country in the European Union, the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (590 inhabitants/sq mi). The fertility rate of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. Germany has the third oldest population in the world, with an average age of 47.4 years.[4]\n\n\nFour sizeable groups of people are referred to as national minorities because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries:[223] There is a Danish minority in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein;[223] the Sorbs, a Slavic population, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg; the Roma and Sinti live throughout the country; and the Frisians are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western coast and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.[223]\n\n\nAfter the United States, Germany is the second-most popular immigration destination in the world.[224] In 2015, following the 2015 refugee crisis, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.[225] Refugee crises have resulted in substantial population increases. For example, the major influx of Ukrainian immigrants following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, meaning over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[226] As of 2019[update], Germany ranks seventh among EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[227] In 2022 there were 23.8 million people, 28.7 percent of the total population, who had a migration background.[228]\n\n\nGermany has a number of large cities. There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions. The country's largest city is Berlin, while its largest urban area is the Ruhr.[229]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in GermanyStatistical offices in Germany (31 December 2018)\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. |\n| 1 | Berlin | Berlin | 3,644,826 | 11 | Bremen | Bremen | 569,352\n |\n| 2 | Hamburg | Hamburg | 1,841,179 | 12 | Dresden | Saxony | 554,649\n |\n| 3 | Munich | Bavaria | 1,471,508 | 13 | Hanover | Lower Saxony | 538,068\n |\n| 4 | Cologne | North Rhine-Westphalia | 1,085,664 | 14 | Nuremberg | Bavaria | 518,365\n |\n| 5 | Frankfurt | Hesse | 753,056 | 15 | Duisburg | North Rhine-Westphalia | 498,590\n |\n| 6 | Stuttgart | Baden-Württemberg | 634,830 | 16 | Bochum | North Rhine-Westphalia | 364,628\n |\n| 7 | Düsseldorf | North Rhine-Westphalia | 619,294 | 17 | Wuppertal | North Rhine-Westphalia | 354,382\n |\n| 8 | Leipzig | Saxony | 587,857 | 18 | Bielefeld | North Rhine-Westphalia | 333,786\n |\n| 9 | Dortmund | North Rhine-Westphalia | 587,010 | 19 | Bonn | North Rhine-Westphalia | 327,258\n |\n| 10 | Essen | North Rhine-Westphalia | 583,109 | 20 | Münster | North Rhine-Westphalia | 314,319\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Germany\n\n![](image)Cologne Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nChristianity was introduced to the area of modern Germany by 300 AD and became fully Christianized by the time of Charlemagne in the eighth and ninth century. After the Reformation started by Martin Luther in the early 16th century, many people left the Catholic Church and became Protestant, mainly Lutheran and Calvinist.[230]\n\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Christianity was the largest religion in Germany, with 66.8% of respondents identifying as Christian, of which 3.8% were not church members.[231] 31.7% declared themselves as Protestants, including members of the Protestant Church in Germany (which encompasses Lutheran, Reformed, and administrative or confessional unions of both traditions) and the free churches (*Evangelische Freikirchen*); 31.2% declared themselves as Roman Catholics, and Orthodox believers constituted 1.3%. According to data from 2016, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Church claimed 28.5% and 27.5%, respectively, of the population.[232][233] Islam is the second-largest religion in the country.[234]\n\n\nIn the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[235] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. Other religions comprise less than one per cent of Germany's population.[234]\n\n\nA study in 2018 estimated that 38% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination,[236] though up to a third may still consider themselves religious. Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.[237][238]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German language and Languages of Germany\n\nGerman is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.[239] It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three procedural languages of the European Commission.[240] German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.[241]\n\n\nRecognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, Sorbian, Romani, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Polish, Greek, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian and other Balkan languages, as well as Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.[239]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Germany\n\n![](image)Heidelberg University, Germany's oldest institution of higher learning and generally considered one of its most renowned\nResponsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[242] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.[243] A system of apprenticeship called *Duale Ausbildung* leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[242] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.[244]\n\n\nMost of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.[245] The general requirement for attending university is the *Abitur*. According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.[246] The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386), Leipzig University (established in 1409) and the University of Rostock (established in 1419) being the oldest.[247] The Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many Western universities.[248][249] In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Germany\n\n![](image)The Hospital of the Holy Spirit in Lübeck, established in 1286, is a precursor to modern hospitals.[250]\nGermany's system of hospitals, called *Krankenhäuser*, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s.[251] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013[update].[252] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.[253]\n\n\nGermany ranked 21st in the world in 2019 in life expectancy with 78.7 years for men and 84.8 years for women according to the WHO, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births). In 2019[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.[254] Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2014 study showed that 52 per cent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.[255]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Germany\n\nSee also: Science and technology in Germany\n\n![](image)A German Christmas market in Dresden\nCulture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular. Historically, Germany has been called *Das Land der Dichter und Denker* ('the land of poets and thinkers'),[256] because of the major role its scientists, writers and philosophers have played in the development of Western thought.[257] A global opinion poll for the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.[258][259]\n\n\nGermany is well known for such folk festival traditions as the Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.[260][261] As of 2016[update] UNESCO inscribed 41 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.[262] There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the *Tag der Deutschen Einheit* (German Unity Day).[263]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Germany\n\n![](image)Ludwig van Beethoven, one of the most famed composers of classical music, was born in Bonn in 1770.\nGerman classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel were influential composers of the Baroque period. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms were significant Romantic composers. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Wolfgang Rihm are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.[264]\n\n\nAs of 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe, and fourth-largest in the world.[265] German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie, Volksmusik (folk music), schlager pop and German hip hop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.[266] DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Paul van Dyk, Felix Jaehn, Paul Kalkbrenner, Robin Schulz and Scooter).[267]\n\n\n\n### Art, design and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German art, Architecture of Germany, and German fashion\n\n![](image)\nC.D. Friedrich, *Wanderer above the Sea of Fog* (1818)\n![](image)\nFranz Marc, *Roe Deer in the Forest* (1914)\n\nGerman painters have influenced Western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; *Die Brücke* (The Bridge) and *Der Blaue Reiter* (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic. After World War II, broad trends in German art include neo-expressionism and the New Leipzig School.[268]\n\n\nGerman designers became early leaders of modern product design.[269] The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.[270]\n\n\nArchitectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance).[268] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (*Fachwerk*) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[271] When industrialisation spread across Europe, classicism and a distinctive style of historicism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as *Gründerzeit* *style*. Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.[268] Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.[272] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto.[273]\n\n\n\n### Literature and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German literature and German philosophy\n\n![](image)Brothers Grimm, who collected and published popular German folk tales\nGerman literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.[274] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their *Deutsches Wörterbuch*, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.[275]\n\n\nInfluential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll, and Günter Grass.[276] The German book market is the third-largest in the world, after the United States and China.[277] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.[278] The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe.[279]\n\n\nGerman philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; and the development of the Frankfurt School have all been very influential.[280]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Media of Germany and Cinema of Germany\n\n![](image)Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam, the world's first large-scale film studio\nThe largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are the Bertelsmann enterprise, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with some 38 million TV households.[281] Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels.[282] There are more than 300 public and private radio stations in Germany; Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio and the public Deutsche Welle is the main German radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages.[282] Germany's print market of newspapers and magazines is the largest in Europe.[282] The papers with the highest circulation are *Bild*, *Süddeutsche Zeitung*, *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung* and *Die Welt*.[282] The largest magazines include *ADAC Motorwelt* and *Der Spiegel*.[282] Germany has a large video gaming market, with over 34 million players nationwide.[283] The Gamescom is the world's largest gaming convention.[284]\n\n\nGerman cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's *Metropolis* (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as *Trümmerfilm* (rubble film). East German film was dominated by state-owned film studio DEFA, while the dominant genre in West Germany was the *Heimatfilm* (\"homeland film\").[285] During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.\n\n\nThe Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (\"Oscar\") went to the German production *The Tin Drum* (*Die Blechtrommel*) in 1979, to *Nowhere in Africa* (*Nirgendwo in Afrika*) in 2002, and to *The Lives of Others* (*Das Leben der Anderen*) in 2007. Various Germans won an Oscar for their performances in other films. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as \"Berlinale\", awarding the \"Golden Bear\" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals. The \"Lolas\" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards.[286]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: German cuisine\n\n![](image)Bavarian Bratwurst with mustard, a pretzel, and German beer\nGerman cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities, including with the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia, Switzerland, and Austria. International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine, and doner kebab are popular.\n\n\nBread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 types of pastries and rolls (*Brötchen*).[287] German cheeses account for about 22% of all cheese produced in Europe.[288] In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts and Weisswursts.[289]\n\n\nThe national alcoholic drink is beer.[290] German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres (24 imp gal; 29 US gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.[291] German beer purity regulations date back to the 16th century.[292] Wine has become popular in many parts of the country, especially close to German wine regions.[293] In 2019, Germany was the ninth-largest wine producer in the world.[294]\n\n\nThe 2018 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, giving the country a cumulative total of 300 stars.[295]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Germany\n\n![](image)The German national football team after winning the FIFA World Cup for the fourth time in 2014\nFootball is the most popular sport in Germany. With more than 7 million official members, the German Football Association (*Deutscher Fußball-Bund*) is the largest single-sport organisation worldwide,[296] and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second-highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world.[297] The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014,[298] the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996,[299] and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017.[300]\n\n\nGermany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 19 times, and Audi 13 times (as of 2017[update]).[301] The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career, having won seven Formula One World Drivers' Championships.[302] Sebastian Vettel is also among the most successful Formula One drivers of all time.[303]\n\n\nGerman athletes historically have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count when combining East and West German medals prior to German reunification.[304] In 1936 Berlin hosted the Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Munich hosted the Summer Games of 1972.[305][306]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n\n\n* Outline of Germany\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** From 1952 to 1990, the entire \"Lied der Deutschen\" was the national anthem, but only the third verse was sung on official occasions.

It is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the most populous member state of the European Union. Germany is situated between the Baltic and North seas to the north, and the Alps to the south. Its 16 constituent states are bordered by Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr.\n\n\nVarious Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.\n\n\nFormal unification of Germany into the modern nation-state was commenced on 18 August 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North German Confederation later transformed in 1871 into the German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was in turn transformed into the semi-presidential Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, in 1949, Germany as a whole was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, known as East Germany, while Berlin continued its *de jure* Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of communist led-government in East Germany, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990.\n\n\nGermany has been described as a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe, the world's third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer. As a developed country it offers social security, a universal health care system and a tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, European Union, NATO, Council of Europe, G7, G20, and OECD. It has the third-greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of Germany, Germani, and Germania\n\nThe English word *Germany* derives from the Latin *Germania*, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[12] The German term *Deutschland*, originally *diutisciu land* ('the German lands') is derived from *deutsch* (cf. *Dutch*), descended from Old High German *diutisc* 'of the people' (from *diot* or *diota* 'people'), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic \\**þiudiskaz* 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form *Theodiscus*), derived from \\**þeudō*, descended from Proto-Indo-European \\**tewtéh₂-* 'people', from which the word *Teutons* also originates.[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Germany\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of German history.\n\nPre-human ancestors, the *Danuvius guggenmosi*, who were present in Germany over 11 million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest ones to walk on two legs.[14] Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.[15] The first non-modern human fossil (the Neanderthal) was discovered in the Neander Valley.[16] Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the Swabian Jura, including 42,000-year-old flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[17] the 40,000-year-old Lion Man,[18] and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels.[19] The Nebra sky disk, created during the European Bronze Age, has been attributed to a German site.[20]\n\n\n\n### Germanic tribes and the Frankish Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Jastorf culture, Germanic peoples, Germania, Migration Period, and Frankish Realm\n\n![](image)A model of Augusta Treverorum, part of the Roman Empire in the 4th century\nThe Germanic peoples are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age, early Iron Age, or the Jastorf culture.[21][22] From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the Celtic, Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes.[23]\n\n\nUnder Augustus, the Roman Empire began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of Germania between the Rhine and Elbe rivers. In 9 AD, three Roman legions were defeated by Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.[24] The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania, and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history.[25] By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote *Germania*, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of modern Germany. However, Baden-Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been incorporated into Roman provinces.[26][27][28]\n\n\nAround 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[29] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria, and areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes.[26]\n\n\n\n\n### East Francia and the Holy Roman Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: East Francia and Holy Roman Empire\n\n![](image)East Francia in 843\n![](image)Martin Luther, born in Eisleben in 1483, challenged the indulgences of the Catholic Church, giving rise to the Reformation and Protestantism.\nCharlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843.[30] The eastern successor kingdom of East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[30] Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies.[31] In 996, Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture controversy.[32]\n\n\nUnder the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (*Ostsiedlung*).[33] Members of the Hanseatic League, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[34] The population declined starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–1350.[35] The Golden Bull issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors.[36]\n\n\nJohannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge.[37] In 1517, Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation and his translation of the Bible began the standardization of the language; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the \"Evangelical\" faith (Lutheranism), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects (*cuius regio, eius religio*).[38] From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.[39][40]\n\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates;[39] their mostly German-speaking rulers were able to choose Catholicism, Lutheranism, or Calvinism as their official religion.[41] The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet.[42] The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of the Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as empress consort when her husband, Francis I, became emperor.[43][44]\n\n\nFrom 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland.[45][46] During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the *Imperium* was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.[47]\n\n\n\n### German Confederation and Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German question, German Confederation, Unification of Germany, German Empire, and German colonial empire\n\n![](image)The German Confederation in 1815\nFollowing the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the emperor of Austria as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of Prussia's rising influence. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich.[48][49] The *Zollverein*, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[50] In light of revolutionary movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the German question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.[51]\n\n\nKing William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the war with Denmark in 1864; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austria. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser, and Berlin became its capital.[52][53]\n\n\nIn the *Gründerzeit* period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as chancellor of Germany secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[53] However, under Wilhelm II, Germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[54] A dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary; the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[55] At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.[56] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and China.[57] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), from 1904 to 1907, carried out the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples as punishment for an uprising;[58][59] this was the 20th century's first genocide.[59]\n\n\nThe assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[60] a general armistice ended the fighting. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Emperor Wilhelm II and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and Germany was declared a federal republic. Germany's new leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, accepting defeat by the Allies. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.[61] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific.[62]\n\n\n\n### Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany\n\n![](image)Adolf Hitler, dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945\n![](image)A map of German-occupied Europe in 1942 during World War II with areas controlled by the German Reich shown in bold black\nOn 11 August 1919, President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.[63] In the subsequent struggle for power, communists seized power in Bavaria, but conservative elements elsewhere attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putsch. Street fighting in the major industrial centres, the occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops, and a period of hyperinflation followed. A debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.[64][65][66]\n\n\nThe worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929. Chancellor Heinrich Brüning's government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused unemployment of nearly 30% by 1932.[67] The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after a special election in 1932 and Hindenburg appointed Hitler as chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.[68] After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights and the first Nazi concentration camp opened.[69][70] On 23 March 1933, the Enabling Act gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution,[71] and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations, and dramatically increased the country's rearmament.[72] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the *Autobahn*.[73]\n\n\nIn 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.[74] Germany also reacquired control of the Saarland in 1935,[75] remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement, and in violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939.[76] *Kristallnacht* (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.[77]\n\n\nIn August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.[78] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, beginning World War II in Europe;[79] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[80] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, forcing the French government to sign an armistice. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the Allied reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe; the Western allies landed in France and entered Germany despite a final German counteroffensive. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, Germany signed the surrender document on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe[79][81] and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.[82][83]\n\n\nIn what later became known as the Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across Europe. In total 17 million people were systematically murdered, including 6 million Jews, at least 130,000 Romani, 275,000 disabled people, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents.[84] Nazi policies in German-occupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7 million Poles,[85] 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and 3.5 million Soviet prisoners of war.[86][82] German military casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million,[87] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[88] Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.[89]\n\n\n\n### East and West Germany[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Germany (1945–1990), Allied-occupied Germany, West Germany, and East Germany\n\n![](image)A map of Germany in 1947, following the end of World War II, including American, Soviet, British, and French occupation zones and the French-controlled Saar Protectorate. Territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union under the terms of the Potsdam Conference.[90]\nAfter Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies *de jure* abolished German state and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (German: *Bundesrepublik Deutschland*); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (German: *Deutsche Demokratische Republik*; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[91] East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.[92]\n\n\nWest Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American Marshall Plan.[93] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor of Germany in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (*Wirtschaftswunder*) beginning in the early 1950s.[94] West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community.[95] On 1 January 1957, the Saarland joined West Germany.[96]\n\n\nEast Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the Soviet Union via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (*Politbüro*) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service.[97] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[98] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the Cold War.[99]\n\n\nTensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's *Ostpolitik*.[100] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open its border with Austria, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the *Wende* reform process culminating in the *Two Plus Four Treaty* under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.[101] The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, German reunification and *Die Wende* (\"the turning point\").[102]\n\n\n\n### Reunified Germany and the European Union[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German reunification and History of Germany since 1990\n\n![](image)The Berlin Wall during its fall in 1989 and the Brandenburg Gate (background) was one of the first developments in the end of the Cold War, leading ultimately to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nUnited Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of West Germany so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[103] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act (1994), Berlin again became the capital of Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a *Bundesstadt* (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.[104] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.[105][106]\n\n\nSince reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007,[107] and co-founding the eurozone.[108] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.[109][110]\n\n\nIn the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan.[111] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (*Energiewende*) for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.[112] During the 2015 European migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.[113]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Germany\n\n![](image)A physical map of Germany\nGermany is the seventh-largest country in Europe;[4] bordering Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria to the southeast, and Switzerland to the south-southwest. France, Luxembourg and Belgium are situated to the west, with the Netherlands to the northwest. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,022 km2 (137,847 sq mi), consisting of 348,672 km2 (134,623 sq mi) of land and 8,350 km2 (3,224 sq mi) of water.\n\n\nElevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (*Nordsee*) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (*Ostsee*) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[114]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.[4]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMost of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north and west to continental in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.[115]\n\n\nFrom February 2019–2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C (37.9 °F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in June 2019.[116] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[117] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[118]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Berchtesgaden National Park in Bavaria\nThe territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial ecoregions: Atlantic mixed forests, Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, Western European broadleaf forests, and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[119] As of 2016[update] 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.[120]\n\n\nPlants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are conifers, particularly spruce and pine.[121] There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.[122] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.[123]\n\n\nThe 16 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park.[124] In addition, there are 17 Biosphere Reserves,[125] and 105 nature parks.[126] More than 400 zoos and animal parks operate in Germany.[127] The Berlin Zoo, which opened in 1844, is the oldest in Germany, and claims the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.[128]\n\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Germany, Taxation in Germany, and Federal budget of Germany\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Frank-Walter SteinmeierPresident(representative head of state) | Olaf ScholzChancellor(head of government) |\n\n\nGermany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the *Bundestag* (Federal Diet) and *Bundesrat* (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The *Bundestag* is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the *Bundesrat* represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[4] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the *Grundgesetz* (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the *Bundestag* and the *Bundesrat*; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.[129]\n\n\nThe president, currently Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the *Bundesversammlung* (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the *Bundestag* and an equal number of state delegates.[4] The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the *Bundestagspräsident* (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the *Bundestag* and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[130] The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the *Bundespräsident* after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the *Bundestag*.[4] The chancellor, currently Olaf Scholz, is the head of government and exercises executive power through his Cabinet.[4]\n\n\nSince 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party The Left has been a staple in the German *Bundestag*, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### Constituent states[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: States of Germany, Federalism in Germany, and List of current Minister-presidents of the German federal states\n\nGermany is a federation and comprises sixteen constituent states which are collectively referred to as *Länder*.[133] Each state (*Land*) has its own constitution,[134] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.[133] As of 2017[update] Germany is divided into 401 districts (*Kreise*) at a municipal level; these consist of 294 rural districts and 107 urban districts.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![Lower Saxony](image) Lower Saxony\n\n![Free Hanseatic City of Bremen](image) Bremen\n\n![Hamburg](image) Hamburg\n\n![Mecklenburg-Vorpommern](image) Mecklenburg-  \nVorpommern\n\n![Saxony-Anhalt](image) Saxony-  \nAnhalt\n\n![Saxony](image) Saxony\n\n![Brandenburg](image) Brandenburg\n\n![Berlin](image) Berlin\n\n![Thuringia](image) Thuringia\n\n![Hesse](image) Hesse\n\n![North Rhine-Westphalia](image) North Rhine-  \nWestphalia\n\n![Rhineland-Palatinate](image) Rhineland-Palatinate\n\n![Bavaria](image) Bavaria\n\n![Baden-Württemberg](image) Baden-  \nWürttemberg\n\n![Saarland](image) Saarland\n\n![Schleswig-Holstein](image) Schleswig-Holstein\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| State | Capital | Area (km2)[136] | Population (2018)[137] | Nominal GDP billions EUR (2015)[138] | Nominal GDP per capita EUR (2015)[138] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baden-Württemberg | Stuttgart | 35,751 | 11,069,533 | 461 | 42,800\n |\n| Bavaria | Munich | 70,550 | 13,076,721 | 550 | 43,100\n |\n| Berlin | Berlin | 892 | 3,644,826 | 125 | 35,700\n |\n| Brandenburg | Potsdam | 29,654 | 2,511,917 | 66 | 26,500\n |\n| Bremen | Bremen | 420 | 682,986 | 32 | 47,600\n |\n| Hamburg | Hamburg | 755 | 1,841,179 | 110 | 61,800\n |\n| Hesse | Wiesbaden | 21,115 | 6,265,809 | 264 | 43,100\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | Schwerin | 23,214 | 1,609,675 | 40 | 25,000\n |\n| Lower Saxony | Hanover | 47,593 | 7,982,448 | 259 | 32,900\n |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | Düsseldorf | 34,113 | 17,932,651 | 646 | 36,500\n |\n| Rhineland-Palatinate | Mainz | 19,854 | 4,084,844 | 132 | 32,800\n |\n| Saarland | Saarbrücken | 2,569 | 990,509 | 35 | 35,400\n |\n| Saxony | Dresden | 18,416 | 4,077,937 | 113 | 27,800\n |\n| Saxony-Anhalt | Magdeburg | 20,452 | 2,208,321 | 57 | 25,200\n |\n| Schleswig-Holstein | Kiel | 15,802 | 2,896,712 | 86 | 31,200\n |\n| Thuringia | Erfurt | 16,202 | 2,143,145 | 57 | 26,400\n |\n| Germany | Berlin | 357,386 | 83,019,213 | 3025 | 37,100\n |\n\n |\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law of Germany, Judiciary of Germany, and Law enforcement in Germany\n\nGermany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law.[139] The *Bundesverfassungsgericht* (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.[140] Germany's supreme court system is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Fiscal Court and the Federal Administrative Court.[141]\n\n\nCriminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the *Strafgesetzbuch* and the *Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch* respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.[142] Except for petty crimes, which are tried before a single professional judge, and serious political crimes, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges (*Schöffen*) sit side by side with professional judges.[143][144]\n\n\nGermany has a low murder rate with 1.18 murders per 100,000 as of 2016[update].[145] In 2018, the overall crime rate fell to its lowest since 1992.[146]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage has been legal in Germany since 2017, and LGBT rights are generally protected in the nation.[147]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Germany\n\n![](image)Germany hosted the 2022 G7 summit at Schloss Elmau in Bavaria.\nGermany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad[148] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.[149] Germany is a member of NATO, the OECD, the G7, the G20, the World Bank and the IMF. It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[150][151][152] The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[153] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism.[154] After 1990, Germany and Russia worked together to establish a \"strategic partnership\" in which energy development became one of the most important factors. As a result of the cooperation, Germany imported most of its natural gas and crude oil from Russia.[155][156]\n\n\nThe development policy of Germany is an independent area of foreign policy. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[157] It was the world's second-biggest aid donor in 2019 after the United States.[158]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bundeswehr\n\n![](image)A German TPz Fuchs armoured personnel carrier\nGermany's military, the *Bundeswehr* (Federal Defence), is organised into the *Heer* (Army and special forces KSK), *Marine* (Navy), *Luftwaffe* (Air Force), *Zentraler Sanitätsdienst der Bundeswehr* (Joint Medical Service), *Streitkräftebasis* (Joint Support Service) and *Cyber- und Informationsraum* (Cyber and Information Domain Service) branches. In absolute terms, German military expenditure is the eighth-highest in the world.[159] In 2018, military spending was at $49.5 billion, about 1.2% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%.[160][161] However, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that German military expenditure would be increased past the NATO target of 2%, along with a one-time 2022 infusion of 100 billion euros, representing almost double the 53 billion euro military budget for 2021.[162][163]\n\n\nAs of January 2020[update], the *Bundeswehr* has a strength of 184,001 active soldiers and 80,947 civilians.[164] Reservists are available to the armed forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[165] Until 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, but this has been officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.[166][167] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.[168] According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Germany was the fourth-largest exporter of major arms in the world from 2014 to 2018.[169]\n\n\nIn peacetime, the *Bundeswehr* is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the *Bundeswehr*.[170] The role of the *Bundeswehr* is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994, the term \"defence\" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017,[update] the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against Daesh, 980 in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, and 800 in Kosovo.[171][172]\n\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Germany and Science and technology in Germany\n\n![](image)Frankfurt, a leading business centre in Europe and the seat of the European Central Bank[173]\n![](image)A Blockupy movement demonstration in front of the European Central Bank in 2014\nGermany has a social market economy with a highly skilled labour force, a low level of corruption, and a high level of innovation.[4][174][175] It is the world's third-largest exporter and third-largest importer,[4] and has the largest economy in Europe, which is also the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP,[176] and the fifth-largest by PPP.[177] Its GDP per capita measured in purchasing power standards amounts to 121% of the EU27 average.[178] The service sector contributes approximately 69% of the total GDP, industry 31%, and agriculture 1% as of 2017[update].[4] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat amounts to 3.2% as of January 2020[update], which is the fourth-lowest in the EU.[179]\n\n\nGermany is part of the European single market which represents more than 450 million consumers.[180] In 2017, the country accounted for 28% of the eurozone economy according to the International Monetary Fund.[181] Germany introduced the common European currency, the euro, in 2002.[182] Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is headquartered in Frankfurt.[183][173]\n\n\nBeing home to the modern car, the automotive industry in Germany is regarded as one of the most competitive and innovative in the world,[184] and is the sixth-largest by production as of 2021. Germany is home to Volkswagen Group, the world's second-largest automotive manufacturer in 2022 by both vehicle production[185] and sales,[186] and is the third-largest exporter of cars as of 2023.[187]\n\n\nThe top ten exports of Germany are vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical equipments, pharmaceuticals, transport equipments, basic metals, food products, and rubber and plastics.[188]\n\n\nOf the world's 500 largest stock-market-listed companies measured by revenue in 2019, the Fortune Global 500, 29 are headquartered in Germany.[189] 30 major Germany-based companies are included in the DAX, the German stock market index which is operated by Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[190] Well-known international brands include Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, Siemens, Allianz, Adidas, Porsche, Bosch and Deutsche Telekom.[191] Berlin is a hub for startup companies and has become the leading location for venture capital funded firms in the European Union.[192] Germany is recognised for its large portion of specialised small and medium enterprises, known as the *Mittelstand* model.[193] These companies represent 48% of the global market leaders in their segments, labelled hidden champions.[194]\n\n\nResearch and development efforts form an integral part of the German economy.[195] In 2018, Germany ranked fourth globally in terms of number of science and engineering research papers published.[196] Research institutions in Germany include the Max Planck Society, the Helmholtz Association, and the Fraunhofer Society and the Leibniz Association.[197] Germany is the largest contributor to the European Space Agency.[198] Germany was ranked 8th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[199]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in Germany, Energy in Germany, Telecommunications in Germany, and Water supply and sanitation in Germany\n\n![](image)An ICE 3 train on the Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line, with operating speed up to 300 km/h (190 mph)\nWith its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent.[200] Its road network is among the densest in Europe.[201] The motorway (Autobahn) is widely known for having no general federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[202] The Intercity Express or *ICE* train network serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph).[203] The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport.[204] The Port of Hamburg is one of the twenty largest container ports in the world.[205]\n\n\nIn 2019[update], Germany was the world's seventh-largest consumer of energy.[206] All nuclear power plants were phased out in 2023.[207] It meets the country's power demands using 40% renewable sources, and it has been called an \"early leader\" in solar and offshore wind.[208][209] Germany is committed to the Paris Agreement and several other treaties promoting biodiversity, low emission standards, and water management.[210][211][212] The country's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world—at around 65%.[213] The country's greenhouse gas emissions per capita were the ninth-highest in the EU in 2018[update], but these numbers have been trending downward.[214][215] The German energy transition (*Energiewende*) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy.[216][209]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Germany\n\n![](image)Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria\nGermany is the ninth-most visited country in the world as of 2017[update], with 37.4 million visits.[217] Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over €105.3 billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry supports 4.2 million jobs.[218]\n\n\nGermany's most visited and popular landmarks include Cologne Cathedral, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, the Dresden Frauenkirche, Neuschwanstein Castle, Heidelberg Castle, the Wartburg, and Sanssouci Palace.[219] The Europa-Park near Freiburg is Europe's second-most popular theme park resort.[220]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Germany and Germans\n\n![](image)A bilingual street sign in both German and Lower Sorbian in Cottbus in Brandenburg\nWith a population of 80.2 million according to the 2011 German Census,[221] rising to 83.7 million as of 2022[update],[222] Germany is the most populous country in the European Union, the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (590 inhabitants/sq mi). The fertility rate of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. Germany has the third oldest population in the world, with an average age of 47.4 years.[4]\n\n\nFour sizeable groups of people are referred to as national minorities because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries:[223] There is a Danish minority in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein;[223] the Sorbs, a Slavic population, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg; the Roma and Sinti live throughout the country; and the Frisians are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western coast and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.[223]\n\n\nAfter the United States, Germany is the second-most popular immigration destination in the world.[224] In 2015, following the 2015 refugee crisis, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.[225] Refugee crises have resulted in substantial population increases. For example, the major influx of Ukrainian immigrants following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, meaning over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[226] As of 2019[update], Germany ranks seventh among EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[227] In 2022 there were 23.8 million people, 28.7 percent of the total population, who had a migration background.[228]\n\n\nGermany has a number of large cities. There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions. The country's largest city is Berlin, while its largest urban area is the Ruhr.[229]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in GermanyStatistical offices in Germany (31 December 2018)\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. |\n| 1 | Berlin | Berlin | 3,644,826 | 11 | Bremen | Bremen | 569,352\n |\n| 2 | Hamburg | Hamburg | 1,841,179 | 12 | Dresden | Saxony | 554,649\n |\n| 3 | Munich | Bavaria | 1,471,508 | 13 | Hanover | Lower Saxony | 538,068\n |\n| 4 | Cologne | North Rhine-Westphalia | 1,085,664 | 14 | Nuremberg | Bavaria | 518,365\n |\n| 5 | Frankfurt | Hesse | 753,056 | 15 | Duisburg | North Rhine-Westphalia | 498,590\n |\n| 6 | Stuttgart | Baden-Württemberg | 634,830 | 16 | Bochum | North Rhine-Westphalia | 364,628\n |\n| 7 | Düsseldorf | North Rhine-Westphalia | 619,294 | 17 | Wuppertal | North Rhine-Westphalia | 354,382\n |\n| 8 | Leipzig | Saxony | 587,857 | 18 | Bielefeld | North Rhine-Westphalia | 333,786\n |\n| 9 | Dortmund | North Rhine-Westphalia | 587,010 | 19 | Bonn | North Rhine-Westphalia | 327,258\n |\n| 10 | Essen | North Rhine-Westphalia | 583,109 | 20 | Münster | North Rhine-Westphalia | 314,319\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Germany\n\n![](image)Cologne Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nChristianity was introduced to the area of modern Germany by 300 AD and became fully Christianized by the time of Charlemagne in the eighth and ninth century. After the Reformation started by Martin Luther in the early 16th century, many people left the Catholic Church and became Protestant, mainly Lutheran and Calvinist.[230]\n\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Christianity was the largest religion in Germany, with 66.8% of respondents identifying as Christian, of which 3.8% were not church members.[231] 31.7% declared themselves as Protestants, including members of the Protestant Church in Germany (which encompasses Lutheran, Reformed, and administrative or confessional unions of both traditions) and the free churches (*Evangelische Freikirchen*); 31.2% declared themselves as Roman Catholics, and Orthodox believers constituted 1.3%. According to data from 2016, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Church claimed 28.5% and 27.5%, respectively, of the population.[232][233] Islam is the second-largest religion in the country.[234]\n\n\nIn the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[235] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. Other religions comprise less than one per cent of Germany's population.[234]\n\n\nA study in 2018 estimated that 38% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination,[236] though up to a third may still consider themselves religious. Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.[237][238]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German language and Languages of Germany\n\nGerman is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.[239] It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three procedural languages of the European Commission.[240] German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.[241]\n\n\nRecognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, Sorbian, Romani, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Polish, Greek, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian and other Balkan languages, as well as Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.[239]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Germany\n\n![](image)Heidelberg University, Germany's oldest institution of higher learning and generally considered one of its most renowned\nResponsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[242] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.[243] A system of apprenticeship called *Duale Ausbildung* leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[242] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.[244]\n\n\nMost of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.[245] The general requirement for attending university is the *Abitur*. According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.[246] The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386), Leipzig University (established in 1409) and the University of Rostock (established in 1419) being the oldest.[247] The Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many Western universities.[248][249] In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Germany\n\n![](image)The Hospital of the Holy Spirit in Lübeck, established in 1286, is a precursor to modern hospitals.[250]\nGermany's system of hospitals, called *Krankenhäuser*, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s.[251] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013[update].[252] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.[253]\n\n\nGermany ranked 21st in the world in 2019 in life expectancy with 78.7 years for men and 84.8 years for women according to the WHO, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births). In 2019[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.[254] Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2014 study showed that 52 per cent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.[255]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Germany\n\nSee also: Science and technology in Germany\n\n![](image)A German Christmas market in Dresden\nCulture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular. Historically, Germany has been called *Das Land der Dichter und Denker* ('the land of poets and thinkers'),[256] because of the major role its scientists, writers and philosophers have played in the development of Western thought.[257] A global opinion poll for the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.[258][259]\n\n\nGermany is well known for such folk festival traditions as the Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.[260][261] As of 2016[update] UNESCO inscribed 41 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.[262] There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the *Tag der Deutschen Einheit* (German Unity Day).[263]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Germany\n\n![](image)Ludwig van Beethoven, one of the most famed composers of classical music, was born in Bonn in 1770.\nGerman classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel were influential composers of the Baroque period. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms were significant Romantic composers. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Wolfgang Rihm are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.[264]\n\n\nAs of 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe, and fourth-largest in the world.[265] German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie, Volksmusik (folk music), schlager pop and German hip hop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.[266] DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Paul van Dyk, Felix Jaehn, Paul Kalkbrenner, Robin Schulz and Scooter).[267]\n\n\n\n### Art, design and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German art, Architecture of Germany, and German fashion\n\n![](image)\nC.D. Friedrich, *Wanderer above the Sea of Fog* (1818)\n![](image)\nFranz Marc, *Roe Deer in the Forest* (1914)\n\nGerman painters have influenced Western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; *Die Brücke* (The Bridge) and *Der Blaue Reiter* (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic. After World War II, broad trends in German art include neo-expressionism and the New Leipzig School.[268]\n\n\nGerman designers became early leaders of modern product design.[269] The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.[270]\n\n\nArchitectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance).[268] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (*Fachwerk*) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[271] When industrialisation spread across Europe, classicism and a distinctive style of historicism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as *Gründerzeit* *style*. Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.[268] Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.[272] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto.[273]\n\n\n\n### Literature and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German literature and German philosophy\n\n![](image)Brothers Grimm, who collected and published popular German folk tales\nGerman literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.[274] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their *Deutsches Wörterbuch*, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.[275]\n\n\nInfluential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll, and Günter Grass.[276] The German book market is the third-largest in the world, after the United States and China.[277] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.[278] The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe.[279]\n\n\nGerman philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; and the development of the Frankfurt School have all been very influential.[280]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Media of Germany and Cinema of Germany\n\n![](image)Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam, the world's first large-scale film studio\nThe largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are the Bertelsmann enterprise, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with some 38 million TV households.[281] Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels.[282] There are more than 300 public and private radio stations in Germany; Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio and the public Deutsche Welle is the main German radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages.[282] Germany's print market of newspapers and magazines is the largest in Europe.[282] The papers with the highest circulation are *Bild*, *Süddeutsche Zeitung*, *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung* and *Die Welt*.[282] The largest magazines include *ADAC Motorwelt* and *Der Spiegel*.[282] Germany has a large video gaming market, with over 34 million players nationwide.[283] The Gamescom is the world's largest gaming convention.[284]\n\n\nGerman cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's *Metropolis* (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as *Trümmerfilm* (rubble film). East German film was dominated by state-owned film studio DEFA, while the dominant genre in West Germany was the *Heimatfilm* (\"homeland film\").[285] During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.\n\n\nThe Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (\"Oscar\") went to the German production *The Tin Drum* (*Die Blechtrommel*) in 1979, to *Nowhere in Africa* (*Nirgendwo in Afrika*) in 2002, and to *The Lives of Others* (*Das Leben der Anderen*) in 2007. Various Germans won an Oscar for their performances in other films. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as \"Berlinale\", awarding the \"Golden Bear\" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals. The \"Lolas\" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards.[286]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: German cuisine\n\n![](image)Bavarian Bratwurst with mustard, a pretzel, and German beer\nGerman cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities, including with the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia, Switzerland, and Austria. International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine, and doner kebab are popular.\n\n\nBread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 types of pastries and rolls (*Brötchen*).[287] German cheeses account for about 22% of all cheese produced in Europe.[288] In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts and Weisswursts.[289]\n\n\nThe national alcoholic drink is beer.[290] German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres (24 imp gal; 29 US gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.[291] German beer purity regulations date back to the 16th century.[292] Wine has become popular in many parts of the country, especially close to German wine regions.[293] In 2019, Germany was the ninth-largest wine producer in the world.[294]\n\n\nThe 2018 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, giving the country a cumulative total of 300 stars.[295]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Germany\n\n![](image)The German national football team after winning the FIFA World Cup for the fourth time in 2014\nFootball is the most popular sport in Germany. With more than 7 million official members, the German Football Association (*Deutscher Fußball-Bund*) is the largest single-sport organisation worldwide,[296] and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second-highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world.[297] The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014,[298] the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996,[299] and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017.[300]\n\n\nGermany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 19 times, and Audi 13 times (as of 2017[update]).[301] The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career, having won seven Formula One World Drivers' Championships.[302] Sebastian Vettel is also among the most successful Formula One drivers of all time.[303]\n\n\nGerman athletes historically have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count when combining East and West German medals prior to German reunification.[304] In 1936 Berlin hosted the Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Munich hosted the Summer Games of 1972.[305][306]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n\n\n* Outline of Germany\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** From 1952 to 1990, the entire \"Lied der Deutschen\" was the national anthem, but only the third verse was sung on official occasions.

This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products, that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity, on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from China and other emerging Asian economies based on lower labour costs, with higher quality products.[276] Italy was the world's tenth-largest exporter in 2019.

The parliament is perfectly bicameral: the two houses, the Chamber of Deputies that meets in Palazzo Montecitorio, and the Senate of the Republic that meets in Palazzo Madama, have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially President of the Council of Ministers (*Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri*), is Italy's head of government. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister has to pass also eventual further votes of confidence or no confidence in Parliament.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nItaly has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by a constitutional referendum. The President of Italy (*Presidente della Repubblica*), currently Sergio Mattarella since 2015, is Italy's head of state. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the Parliament of Italy and some regional voters in joint session. Italy has a written democratic constitution, resulting from the work of a Constituent Assembly formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the Italian Civil War.[238]\n\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Italy\n\n![](image)\nSergio Mattarella  \nPresident of Italy  \nsince 2015\n![](image)\nGiorgia Meloni  \nPrime Minister of Italy  \nsince 2022\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSee also: Italians, Italian diaspora, Genetic history of Italy, List of cities in Italy, and Racism in Italy\n\n![](image)Map of Italy's population density at the 2011 census\nAt the beginning of 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants.[367] The resulting population density, at 202 inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nItaly has probably the highest level of faunal biodiversity in Europe, with over 57,000 species recorded, representing more than a third of all European fauna,[214] and the highest level of biodiversity of both animal and plant species within the European Union.[215] Italy's varied geological structure contributes to its high climate and habitat diversity. The Italian peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, forming a corridor between central Europe and North Africa, and has 8,000 km (5,000 mi) of coastline. Italy also receives species from the Balkans, Eurasia, and the Middle East. Italy's varied geological structure, including the Alps and the Apennines, Central Italian woodlands, and Southern Italian Garigue and Maquis shrubland, also contribute to high climate and habitat diversity.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights\n* Commissioner on National Minorities\n* Representative on Freedom of the Media\n* Contact Point for Roma and Sinti Issues\n* OSCE Minsk Group\n |\n| Relations | * Armenia–OSCE relations\n* Azerbaijan–OSCE relations\n* List of ambassadors of Italy to OSCE\n* List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to the OSCE\n* United States Mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n |\n| Active field missions | * Presence in Albania\n* Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Mission in Kosovo\n* Mission to Montenegro\n* Mission to Moldova\n* Mission to Serbia\n* Mission to Skopje\n* Centre in Ashgabat\n* Programme Office in Astana\n* Programme Office in Bishkek\n* Programme Office in Dushanbe\n* Project Co-ordinator in Uzbekistan\n* Personal Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office on the Conflict Dealt with by the OSCE Minsk Conference\n |\n| Former field missions | * Needs Assessment Team in Armenia\n* Mission to Croatia\n* Kosovo Verification Mission\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAn autonomous corps of the military, the Carabinieri are the gendarmerie and military police of Italy, policing the military and civilian population alongside Italy's other police forces.

These seas constitute a reservoir of heat and humidity for Italy. Within the southern temperate zone, they determine a Mediterranean climate with local differences due to the geomorphology of the territory, which tends to make its mitigating effects felt, especially in high pressure conditions.[234]\n\n\nBecause of the length of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous hinterland, the climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic. The climate of the Po valley geographical region is mostly humid subtropical, with cool winters and hot summers.[235][236] The coastal areas of Liguria, Tuscany and most of the South generally fit the Mediterranean climate stereotype (Köppen climate classification).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Gran Paradiso, established in 1922, is the oldest Italian national park.\nMany watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity, while because of rising water levels, Venice has been regularly flooded throughout recent years. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas, as in the case of the Seveso disaster.\nThe country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but, after the Chernobyl disaster and a referendum on the issue the nuclear programme was terminated, a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008, planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with French technology. This was in turn struck down by a referendum following the Fukushima nuclear accident.[211]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most visited regions of Italy, measured by nights spent in tourist accommodation establishments, are Veneto, Tuscany, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Lazio.[362] Rome is the 3rd most visited city in Europe and the 12th in the world, with 9.4 million arrivals in 2017 while Milan is the 27th worldwide with 6.8 million tourists.[363] In addition, Venice and Florence are also among the world's top 100 destinations.\n\n\nItaly is also the country with the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world (58).[364] Out of Italy's 58 heritage sites, 53 are cultural and 5 are natural.[365] In Italy there is a broad variety of hotels, going from 1–5 stars. According to ISTAT, in 2017, there were 32,988 hotels with 1,133,452 rooms and 2,239,446 beds.[366] As for non-hotel facilities (campsites, tourist villages, accommodations for rent, agritourism, etc.), in 2017 their number was 171,915 with 2,798,352 beds.[366]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Exhausted nurse takes a break in an Italian hospital during the COVID-19 emergency\nIn the European migrant crisis of the 2010s, Italy was the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU. From 2013 to 2018, the country took in over 700,000 migrants and refugees,[170] mainly from sub-Saharan Africa,[171] which caused strain on the public purse and a surge in the support for far-right or euro-sceptic political parties.[172][173] The 2018 general election was characterised by a strong showing of the Five Star Movement and the League and the university professor Giuseppe Conte became the Prime Minister at the head of a populist coalition between these two parties.[174] However, after only fourteen months the League withdrew its support to Conte, who formed a new unprecedented government coalition between the Five Star Movement and the centre-left.[175][176]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwelve \"historical minority languages\" (*minoranze linguistiche storiche*) are formally recognised: Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian.[394] Four of these also enjoy a co-official status in their respective region: French in the Aosta Valley;[402] German in South Tyrol, and Ladin as well in some parts of the same province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino;[403] and Slovene in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine.[404] A number of other Ethnologue, ISO and UNESCO languages are not recognised by Italian law.

Other examples of large PV plants in Italy are San Bellino (70.6 MW), Cellino san Marco (42.7 MW) and Sant' Alberto (34.6 MW).[323] Italy was the first country in the world to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity.[324] Italy had managed four nuclear reactors until the 1980s. However, nuclear power in Italy has been abandoned following a 1987 referendum (in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Soviet Ukraine), though Italy still imports nuclear energy from Italy-owned reactors in foreign territories.\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe flora of Italy was traditionally estimated to comprise about 5,500 vascular plant species.[223] However, as of 2005[update], 6,759 species are recorded in the *Data bank of Italian vascular flora*.[224] Italy has 1,371 endemic plant species and subspecies,[225] which include Sicilian Fir, Barbaricina columbine, Sea marigold, Lavender cotton and Ucriana violet. Italy is a signatory to the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and the Habitats Directive both affording protection to Italian fauna and flora.\n\n\nItaly has many botanical gardens and historic gardens, some of which are known outside the country.[226][227] The Italian garden is stylistically based on symmetry, axial geometry and on the principle of imposing order over nature.

During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a number of courts competed to attract architects, artists and scholars, thus producing a legacy of monuments, paintings, music and literature. Despite the political and social isolation of these courts, Italy has made a substantial contribution to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe.[445]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Italy\n\n![](image)\nThe city of Venice, built on 117 islands\n![](image)\nThe Duomo and the Leaning Tower of Pisa\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince their appearance in the middle of the 19th century, Italian organised crime and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in Southern Italy, the most notorious of which being the Sicilian Mafia, which would later expand into some foreign countries including the United States.

Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London (1915), so this outcome was denounced as a \"mutilated victory\". The rhetoric of \"mutilated victory\" was adopted by Benito Mussolini and led to the rise of Italian fascism, becoming a key point in the propaganda of Fascist Italy. Historians regard \"mutilated victory\" as a \"political myth\", used by fascists to fuel Italian imperialism and obscure the successes of liberal Italy in the aftermath of World War I.[128] Italy also gained a permanent seat in the League of Nations's executive council.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Olive oil and vegetables are central to the Mediterranean diet.[431]\nLife expectancy in the country is 80 for males and 85 for females, placing the country 5th in the world.[432] In comparison to other Western countries, Italy has a relatively low rate of adult obesity (below 10%[433]), as there are several health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.[434] The proportion of daily smokers was 22% in 2012, down from 24.4% in 2000 but still slightly above the OECD average.[435] Smoking in public places including bars, restaurants, night clubs and offices has been restricted to specially ventilated rooms since 2005.[436] In 2013, UNESCO added the Mediterranean diet to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of Italy (promoter), Morocco, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Croatia.[437][438]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n223. **^** Pignatti, S.

Healthcare spending accounted for 9.7% of GDP in 2020.[440] Italy's healthcare system is consistently ranked among the best in the world.[441][442] In 2018 Italy's healthcare is ranked 20th in Europe in the Euro Health Consumer Index.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom the late 19th century until the 1960s Italy was a country of mass emigration.

Nevertheless, by his time the larger concept of Oenotria and \"Italy\" had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of Lucania as well. According to Strabo's *Geographica*, before the expansion of the Roman Republic, the name was used by ancient Greeks to indicate the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto, corresponding roughly to the current region of Calabria. The ancient Greeks gradually came to apply the name \"Italia\" to a larger region[42] In addition to the \"Greek Italy\" in the south, historians have suggested the existence of an \"Etruscan Italy\" covering variable areas of central Italy.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStarting in the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing under its rule Eritrea and Somalia in East Africa, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica in North Africa (later unified in the colony of Libya) and the Dodecanese islands.[120] From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance forces during the Boxer Rebellion in China; on 7 September 1901, a concession in Tientsin was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a consul. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by Giovanni Giolitti, Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterised by the economic, industrial, and political-cultural modernization of Italian society.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Aristocracy\n* Censorship\n* Corruption\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Education\n* Emigration and diaspora\n* Gambling\n* Health\n* Healthcare\n* Immigration\n* Inventions and discoveries\n* Italians\n\t+ People\n* Languages\n\t+ Italian\n\t\t- Regional\n* Life expectancy\n* Orders, decorations, and medals\n* Poverty\n* Prostitution\n* Public administration\n* Racism\n* Religion\n* Social class\n* Terrorism\n* Water supply and sanitation\n* Women\n |\n| Culture | * Duecento\n* Trecento\n* Quattrocento\n* Cinquecento\n* Seicento\n* Settecento\n* Ottocento\n* Anthem\n* Architecture\n* Art\n* Castles\n* Cathedrals\n* Cinema\n* Coat of arm\n* Cuisine\n* Design\n* Fashion\n* Flag\n* Folklore\n* Gardens\n* Internet\n* Italophilia\n* Libraries\n* Literature\n* Media\n* Museums\n* Music\n* Mythology\n* National symbols\n* Palaces\n* Philosophy\n* Public holidays\n* Sport\n* Television\n* Theatre\n* Traditions\n* World Heritage Sites\n |\n\n |\n| * ![flag](image) Italy portal\n* ![](image) Category\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nItalian Fascism is based upon Italian nationalism and imperialism, and in particular seeks to complete what it considers as the incomplete project of the unification of Italy by incorporating *Italia Irredenta* (unredeemed Italy) into the state of Italy.[131][132] To the east of Italy, the Fascists claimed that Dalmatia was a land of Italian culture whose Italians, including those of Italianized South Slavic descent, had been driven out of Dalmatia and into exile in Italy, and supported the return of Italians of Dalmatian heritage.[133] Mussolini identified Dalmatia as having strong Italian cultural roots for centuries, similarly to Istria, via the Roman Empire and the Republic of Venice.[134] To the south of Italy, the Fascists claimed Malta, which belonged to the United Kingdom, and Corfu, which instead belonged to Greece; to the north claimed Italian Switzerland, while to the west claimed Corsica, Nice, and Savoy, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n152. **^** Adrian Lyttelton (editor), *\"Liberal and fascist Italy, 1900–1945\"*, Oxford University Press, 2002. p. 13\n153. **^** \"Italia\", *Dizionario enciclopedico italiano* (in Italian), vol. VI, Treccani, 1970, p. 456\n154. **^** *Damage Foreshadows A-Bomb Test, 1946/06/06 (1946)*.

The most famous Italian wines are probably the Tuscan Chianti and the Piedmontese Barolo. Other famous wines are Barbaresco, Barbera d'Asti, Brunello di Montalcino, Frascati, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Morellino di Scansano, and the sparkling wines Franciacorta and Prosecco.\n\n\nQuality goods in which Italy specialises, particularly the already mentioned wines and regional cheeses, are often protected under the quality assurance labels DOC/DOP.

The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the \"Big Four\" top Allied powers. The war on the Italian Front was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long attrition war in the Alps, making little progress and suffering heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '*99 Boys* (*Ragazzi del '99*, all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian victories in major battles, such as on Monte Grappa and in a series of battles on the Piave river.

However, the Northern Italy monarchy of the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Sardinia, whose government was led by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. In the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful first war of independence was declared on Austria. In 1855, the Kingdom of Sardinia became an ally of Britain and France in the Crimean War, giving Cavour's diplomacy legitimacy in the eyes of the great powers.[115][116] The Kingdom of Sardinia again attacked the Austrian Empire in the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859, with the aid of France, resulting in liberating Lombardy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Victor Emmanuel II Monument in Rome, a national symbol of Italy celebrating the first king of the unified country, and resting place of the Italian Unknown Soldier since the end of World War I.

Teano was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860 between Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II, last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.[119] Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.

In propaganda, Fascists used the ancient Roman motto \"*Mare Nostrum*\" (Latin for \"Our Sea\") to describe the Mediterranean. For this reason the Fascist regime engaged in interventionist foreign policy. In 1923, the Greek island of Corfu was briefly occupied by Italy, after the assassination of General Tellini in Greek territory. In 1925, Italy forced Albania to become a *de facto* protectorate. In 1935, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and founded Italian East Africa, resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations; Italy allied with Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan and strongly supported Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war. In 1939, Italy formally annexed Albania. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the north, the Germans set up the Italian Social Republic (RSI), a Nazi puppet state with Mussolini installed as leader after he was rescued by German paratroopers. Some Italian troops in the south were organised into the Italian Co-belligerent Army, which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army. Also, the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the *Resistenza*.[145] As result, the country descended into civil war;[146][147] the Italian resistance fought a guerrilla war against the Nazi German occupiers and Italian Fascist forces,[145] while clashes between the Fascist RSI Army and the Royalist Italian Co-Belligerent Army were rare.[148] In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north,[149] but was captured and summarily executed near Lake Como by Italian partisans. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIntroduced in the early 1920s, jazz took a particularly strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the progressive rock and pop movement of the 1970s, with bands like PFM, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Le Orme, Goblin, and Pooh.[506] The same period saw diversification in the cinema of Italy, and Cinecittà films included complex scores by composers including Ennio Morricone, Armando Trovaioli, Piero Piccioni and Piero Umiliani. In the early 1980s, the first star to emerge from the Italian hip hop scene was singer Jovanotti.[507] Italian metal bands include Rhapsody of Fire, Lacuna Coil, Elvenking, Forgotten Tomb, and Fleshgod Apocalypse.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Italian Peninsula, named Italia, was consolidated into a single entity during the Roman expansion and conquest of new lands at the expense of the other Italic tribes, Etruscans, Celts, and Greeks. A permanent association with most of the local tribes and cities was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. In the wake of Julius Caesar's rise and death in the first century BC, Rome grew over the course of centuries into a massive empire stretching from Britain to the borders of Persia, and engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin, in which Greek and Roman and many other cultures merged into a unique civilisation. The long and triumphant reign of the first emperor, Augustus, began a golden age of peace and prosperity. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"La riorganizzazione amministrativa dell'Italia.

More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, of which 90 received an Academy Award nomination and 47 of these won it, from some cinema classics to recent rewarded features (such as *Roman Holiday*, *Ben-Hur*, *Cleopatra*, *Romeo and Juliet*, *The English Patient*, *The Passion of the Christ*, and *Gangs of New York*).[533]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Prehistoric Italy, Italic peoples, Etruscan civilisation, Greek colonisation, Magna Graecia, and Nuragic civilisation\n\nSee also: List of ancient peoples of Italy\n\n![](image)\nThe *Sassi* cave houses of Matera are believed to be among the first human settlements in Italy dating back to the Paleolithic.[58]\n![](image)\nEtruscan fresco in the Monterozzi necropolis, 5th century BC\n\nThousands of Lower Paleolithic artefacts have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo, dating as far back as 850,000 years.[59]\nExcavations throughout Italy revealed a Neanderthal presence dating back to the Middle Palaeolithic period some 200,000 years ago,[60] while modern humans appeared about 40,000 years ago at Riparo Mochi.[61] Archaeological sites from this period include Addaura cave, Altamura, Ceprano, and Gravina in Puglia.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Napoleonic era, in 1797, the first official adoption of the Italian tricolour as a national flag by a sovereign Italian state, the Cispadane Republic, a Napoleonic sister republic of Revolutionary France, took place, on the basis of the events following the French Revolution (1789–1799) which, among its ideals, advocated the national self-determination.[104][105] This event is celebrated by the Tricolour Day.[106] The Italian national colours appeared for the first time on a tricolour cockade in 1789,[107] anticipating by seven years the first green, white and red Italian military war flag, which was adopted by the Lombard Legion in 1796.[108]\n\n\n\n### Unification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Unification of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter centuries of political and territorial divisions, Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861 following Wars of independence and the Expedition of the Thousand, establishing the Kingdom of Italy.[27] From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly industrialised, mainly in the north, and acquired a colonial empire,[28] while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large immigrant diaspora.[29] From 1915 to 1918, Italy took part in World War I on the side of the Entente and against the Central Powers. In 1922, following a period of crisis and turmoil, the Italian fascist dictatorship was established. During World War II, Italy was first part of the Axis until it surrendered to the Allied powers (1940-1943) and then, as part of its territory was occupied by Nazi Germany with fascist collaboration, a co-belligerent of the Allies during the Italian resistance and the liberation of Italy (1943-1945). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s. Following the European wars of succession of the 18th century, the North fell under the influence of the Habsburg-Lorraine of Austria, while the south passed to a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons. During the Coalition Wars, northern and central Italy was reorganised by Napoleon in a number of Sister Republics of France and later as a Kingdom of Italy in personal union with the French Empire.[103] The southern half of the peninsula was administered by Joachim Murat, Napoleon's brother-in-law, who was crowned as King of Naples. The 1814 Congress of Vienna restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the French Revolution could not be eradicated, and soon re-surfaced during the political upheavals that characterised the first part of the 19th century.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItalian meal structure is typical of the European Mediterranean region and differs from North, Central, and Eastern European meal structure, though it still often consists of breakfast (*colazione*), lunch (*pranzo*), and dinner (*cena*).[579] However, much less emphasis is placed on breakfast, and breakfast itself is often skipped or involves lighter meal portions than are seen in non-Mediterranean Western countries.[580] Late-morning and mid-afternoon snacks, called *merenda* (plural *merende*), are also often included in this meal structure.[581]\n\n\nThe marketing phenomenon consisting of words and images, colour combinations (the Italian tricolour) and geographical references for brands that are evocative of Italy to promote and market agri-food products that have nothing to do with Italian cuisine is known by the name of *Italian Sounding*.[582]\n\n\n\n### Public holidays, festivals and folklore[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Public holidays in Italy, Traditions of Italy, and Folklore of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes Leo X (1513–1521) and Clement VII (1523–1534) opposed the Protestant reformation and advanced the interests of their family. In 1559, at the end of the French invasions of Italy and of the Italian wars, the many states of northern Italy remained part of the Holy Roman Empire, indirectly subject to the Austrian Habsburgs, while all of Southern Italy (Naples, Sicily, Sardinia) and Milan were under Spanish Habsburg rule.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** Ferorelli, Nicola (1925). \"La vera origine del tricolore italiano\". *Rassegna Storica del Risorgimento* (in Italian). **XII** (fasc.

Another source of immigration is neighbouring North Africa (in particular, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia), with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the Arab Spring. Furthermore, in recent years, growing migration fluxes from Asia-Pacific (notably China[389] and the Philippines) and Latin America have been recorded.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Latin term *Italicus* was used to describe \"a man of Italy\" as opposed to a provincial.

After the Lombard invasions, \"Italia\" was retained as the name for their kingdom, and for its successor kingdom within the Holy Roman Empire, which nominally lasted until 1806, although it had *de facto* disintegrated due to factional politics pitting the empire against the ascendant city republics in the 13th century.[57]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Italy\n\n### Prehistory and antiquity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n135. **^** Aristotle A.

In Italy artists like Paolo Uccello, Fra Angelico, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna, Filippo Lippi, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Titian took painting to a higher level through the use of perspective, the study of human anatomy and proportion, and through their development of refined drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was active as a sculptor from about 1500 to 1520; his works include his *David*, *Pietà*, *Moses*. Other Renaissance sculptors include Lorenzo Ghiberti, Luca Della Robbia, Donatello, Filippo Brunelleschi and Andrea del Verrocchio.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther astronomers such as Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625–1712) and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835–1910) made discoveries about the Solar System. In mathematics, Joseph Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736–1813) was active before leaving Italy. Fibonacci (c. 1170 – c. 1250), and Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576) made fundamental advances in mathematics.[332] Luca Pacioli established accounting to the world. Physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–1954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the first nuclear reactor. He is considered the \"architect of the nuclear age\"[330] and the \"architect of the atomic bomb\".[331] He, Emilio G. Segrè (1905–1989) who discovered the elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton), Bruno Rossi (1905–1993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by Fascist laws against Jews.[333]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families such as the Medici in Florence, the Visconti and Sforza in the Duchy of Milan, the Doria in the Republic of Genoa, the Loredan, Mocenigo and Barbarigo in the Republic of Venice, the Este in Ferrara, and the Gonzaga in Mantua.[93][94] The Renaissance was therefore a result of the wealth accumulated by Italian merchant cities combined with the patronage of its dominant families.[93] Italian Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards, with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto, Donatello, and Titian, and architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi, Leon Battista Alberti, Andrea Palladio, and Donato Bramante.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe birth of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula. By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism, along with other social, economic, and military events, led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval.[111] Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the political and social Italian unification movement, or *Risorgimento*, emerged to unite Italy consolidating the different states of the peninsula and liberate it from foreign control. A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist Giuseppe Mazzini, member of the secret revolutionary society *Carbonari* and founder of the influential political movement Young Italy in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement. His prolific output of propaganda helped the unification movement stay active.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Fascist regime[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Italian fascism, Fascist Italy (1922–1943), Italian irredentism, Military history of Italy during World War II, Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, and Italian Civil War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Flag of the Cispadane Republic, which was the first Italian tricolour adopted by a sovereign Italian state (1797)\nThe Papacy remained a powerful force and launched the Counter-reformation.

The main historic peoples of possible non-Indo-European or pre-Indo-European heritage include the Etruscans of central and northern Italy, the Elymians and the Sicani in Sicily, and the prehistoric Sardinians, who gave birth to the Nuragic civilisation. Other ancient populations being of undetermined language families and of possible non-Indo-European origin include the Rhaetian people and Cammuni, known for their rock carvings in Valcamonica, the largest collections of prehistoric petroglyphs in the world.[63] A well-preserved natural mummy known as Ötzi the Iceman, determined to be 5,000 years old (between 3400 and 3100 BCE, Copper Age), was discovered in the Similaun glacier of South Tyrol in 1991.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nItaly was the birthplace and heart of the Renaissance during the 1400s and 1500s. The Italian Renaissance marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age as Europe recovered, economically and culturally, from the crises of the Late Middle Ages and entered the Early Modern Period. The Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by Princes, *de facto* monarchs in control of trade and administration, and their courts became major centres of the arts and sciences. The Italian princedoms represented a first form of modern states as opposed to feudal monarchies and multinational empires. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe most notable among them were: Christopher Columbus (Italian: *Cristoforo Colombo*), colonizer in the name of Spain, who is credited with discovering the New World and the opening of the Americas for conquest and settlement by Europeans;[99] John Cabot (Italian: *Giovanni Caboto*), sailing for England, who was the first European to set foot in \"New Found Land\" and explore parts of the North American continent in 1497;[100] Amerigo Vespucci, sailing for Portugal, who first demonstrated in about 1501 that the New World (in particular Brazil) was not Asia as initially conjectured, but a fourth continent previously unknown to people of the Old World (America is named after him);[101] and Giovanni da Verrazzano, at the service of France, renowned as the first European to explore the Atlantic coast of North America between Florida and New Brunswick in 1524.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the fall of Constantinople, the wars in Lombardy came to an end and a defensive alliance known as Italic League was formed between Venice, Naples, Florence, Milan, and the Papacy. Lorenzo *the Magnificent* de Medici was the greatest Florentine patron of the Renaissance and supporter of the Italic League. He notably avoided the collapse of the League in the aftermath of the Pazzi Conspiracy and during the aborted invasion of Italy by the Turks. However, the military campaign of Charles VIII of France in Italy caused the end of the Italic League and initiated the Italian Wars between the Valois and the Habsburgs. During the High Renaissance of the 1500s, Italy was therefore both the main European battleground and the cultural-economic centre of the continent. Popes such as Julius II (1503–1513) fought for the control of Italy against foreign monarchs, others such as Paul III (1534–1549) preferred to mediate between the European powers in order to secure peace in Italy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** J.P.

Also, Andrea Palladio influenced architects throughout Western Europe with the villas and palaces he designed in the middle and late 16th century; the city of Vicenza, with its twenty-three buildings designed by Palladio, and twenty-four Palladian Villas of the Veneto are listed by UNESCO as part of a World Heritage Site named City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto.[451]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n445. **^** Cole, Alison (1995). *Virtue and magnificence: art of the Italian Renaissance courts*.

They were independent thalassocratic city-states, though most of them originated from territories once belonging to the Byzantine Empire. All these cities during the time of their independence had similar systems of government in which the merchant class had considerable power. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther prominent physicists include: Amedeo Avogadro (most noted for his contributions to molecular theory, in particular, the Avogadro's law and the Avogadro constant), Evangelista Torricelli (inventor of barometer), Alessandro Volta (inventor of electric battery), Guglielmo Marconi (inventor of radio), Galileo Ferraris and Antonio Pacinotti, pioneers of the induction motor, Alessandro Cruto, pioneer of light bulb and Innocenzo Manzetti, eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, Ettore Majorana (who discovered the Majorana fermions), Carlo Rubbia (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the W and Z particles at CERN). Antonio Meucci is known for developing a voice-communication device which is often credited as the first telephone.[334][335] Pier Giorgio Perotto in 1964 designed one of the first desktop programmable calculators, the Programma 101.[336][337][338]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)*The Last Supper* (1494–1499), Leonardo da Vinci, Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan\nThe history of Italian visual arts is significant to the history of Western painting. Roman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. Roman painting does have its own unique characteristics. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy. Such paintings can be grouped into four main \"styles\" or periods[456] and may contain the first examples of trompe-l'œil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.[457]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the Russian Revolution, led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small National Fascist Party, led by Benito Mussolini. In October 1922 the Blackshirts of the National Fascist Party attempted a mass demonstration and a coup named the \"March on Rome\" which failed but at the last minute, King Victor Emmanuel III refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister, thereby transferring political power to the fascists without armed conflict.[129][130] Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a dictatorship.

In Sardinia, the former Byzantine provinces became independent states known in Italian as Judicates, although some parts of the island fell under Genoese or Pisan rule until eventual Aragonese annexation in the 15th century. The Black Death pandemic of 1348 left its mark on Italy by killing perhaps one third of the population.[91][92]\n\n\n\n### Early Modern[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Italian Renaissance, Italian Wars, and History of Italy (1559–1814)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Italian victory,[124][125][126] which was announced by the *Bollettino della Vittoria* and the *Bollettino della Vittoria Navale*, marked the end of the war on the Italian Front, secured the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was chiefly instrumental in ending the First World War less than two weeks later.

Italian philosophers were also influential in the development of the non-Marxist liberal socialism philosophy, including Carlo Rosselli, Norberto Bobbio, Piero Gobetti and Aldo Capitini.

The Christian concept of a Basilica, a style of church architecture that came to dominate the early Middle Ages, was invented in Rome. They were known for being long, rectangular buildings, which were built in an almost ancient Roman style, often rich in mosaics and decorations.

In 1992, two major dynamite attacks killed the judges Giovanni Falcone (23 May in the Capaci bombing) and Paolo Borsellino (19 July in the Via D'Amelio bombing).[163] One year later (May–July 1993), tourist spots were attacked, such as the Via dei Georgofili in Florence, Via Palestro in Milan, and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano and Via San Teodoro in Rome, leaving 10 dead and 93 injured and causing severe damage to cultural heritage such as the Uffizi Gallery.

During the course of this voyage, the Medici Bank was made the official credit institution of the Papacy, and several significant ties were established between the Church and the new political dynasties of the peninsula. The Popes' status as elective monarchs turned the conclaves and consistories of the Renaissance into political battles between the courts of Italy for primacy in the peninsula and access to the immense resources of the Catholic Church.

The tradition handed down seven kings: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius and Tarquinius Superbus. In 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city, favouring a government of the Senate and the People (SPQR) and establishing an oligarchic republic.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Italian peninsula was historically the native place and destination of numerous ancient peoples.[19] The Latin city of Rome in central Italy, founded as a Kingdom, became a Republic that conquered the Mediterranean world and ruled it for centuries as an Empire.[20][21] With the spread of Christianity, Rome became the seat of the Catholic Church and of the Papacy. During the Early Middle Ages, Italy experienced the fall of the Western Roman Empire and inward migration from Germanic tribes. By the 11th century, Italian city-states and maritime republics expanded, bringing renewed prosperity through commerce and laying the groundwork for modern capitalism.[22][23] The Italian Renaissance flourished in Florence during the 15th and 16th centuries and spread to the rest of Europe.

The main Sensist Italian philosophers were Melchiorre Gioja and Gian Domenico Romagnosi.[482] Criticism of the Sensist movement came from other philosophers such as Pasquale Galluppi (1770–1846), who affirmed that *a priori* relationships were synthetic.[482] Antonio Rosmini, instead, was the founder of Italian idealism. During the late 19th and 20th centuries, there were also several other movements which gained some form of popularity in Italy, such as Ontologism (whose main philosopher was Vincenzo Gioberti),[483] anarchism, communism, socialism, futurism, fascism and Christian democracy. Giovanni Gentile and Benedetto Croce were two of the most significant 20th-century Idealist philosophers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n453. **^** Hersey, George (2001). *Architecture and Geometry in the Age of the Baroque*.

The most original work of all late Baroque and Rococo architecture is the Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi, dating back to the 18th century.[452] Luigi Vanvitelli began in 1752 the construction of the Royal Palace of Caserta. In this large complex, the grandiose Baroque-style interiors and gardens are opposed to a more sober building envelope.[453] In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Italy was affected by the Neoclassical architectural movement. Villas, palaces, gardens, interiors and art began to be based on Roman and Greek themes.[454]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 19th century, major Italian Romantic painters were Francesco Hayez, Giuseppe Bezzuoli and Francesco Podesti. Impressionism was brought from France to Italy by the *Macchiaioli*, led by Giovanni Fattori, and Giovanni Boldini; Realism by Gioacchino Toma and Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo. In the 20th century, with Futurism, primarily through the works of Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla, Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico, who exerted a strong influence on the Surrealists and generations of artists to follow like Bruno Caruso and Renato Guttuso.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian literature\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n460. **^** Brand, Peter; Pertile, Lino, eds.

The lyric poet Torquato Tasso in *Jerusalem Delivered* wrote a Christian epic in *ottava rima*, with attention to the Aristotelian canons of unity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Ballet dance genre also originated in Italy. It began during the Italian Renaissance court as an outgrowth of court pageantry,[499] where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations. Court musicians and dancers collaborated to provide elaborate entertainment for them.[500] At first, ballets were woven into the midst of an opera to allow the audience a moment of relief from the dramatic intensity. By the mid-seventeenth century, Italian ballets in their entirety were performed in between the acts of an opera. Over time, Italian ballets became part of theatrical life: ballet companies in Italy's major opera houses employed an average of four to twelve dancers; in 1815 many companies employed anywhere from eighty to one hundred dancers.[501]\n\n\nThe Teatro di San Carlo in Naples is the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world, opening in 1737, decades before both Milan's La Scala and Venice's La Fenice theatres.[486]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Dante Alighieri, one of the greatest poets of the Middle Ages.

One of these poets was the notary Giacomo da Lentini, inventor of the sonnet form, though the most famous early sonneteer was Petrarch.[462]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_W7dG3BdyBYVURuPKQMy8WfDw","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

To the north, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia (the two biggest islands of the Mediterranean), in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy,[189][190] while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.[191]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Articles related to Italy\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and dependencies of Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia2\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan1\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus2\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia1\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland3\n* Ireland\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan1\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia1\n* San Marino\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey1\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n* Vatican City4\n | ![](image)\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition\n | * Abkhazia2\n* Kosovo\n* Northern Cyprus2\n* South Ossetia2\n* Transnistria\n |\n| Dependentterritories\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Denmark | * Faroe Islands3\n\t+ autonomous country of the Kingdom of Denmark\n |\n| United Kingdom | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly is the world's sixth-largest manufacturing country,[275] characterised by a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size and many dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises, notoriously clustered in several industrial districts, which are the backbone of the Italian industry. This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products, that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity, on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from China and other emerging Asian economies based on lower labour costs, with higher quality products.[276] Italy was the world's tenth-largest exporter in 2019. Its closest trade ties are with the other countries of the European Union. Its largest export partners in 2019 were Germany (12%), France (11%), and the United States (10%).[277]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the country includes the Italian peninsula, adjacent islands, and most of the southern Alpine basin, some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the Eurasian continental shelf.

Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union, and it is in numerous international institutions including NATO, the G7, the Mediterranean Union, the Latin Union, and many more.

Italy has a written democratic constitution, resulting from the work of a Constituent Assembly formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the Italian Civil War.[238]\n\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Italy\n\n![](image)\nSergio Mattarella  \nPresident of Italy  \nsince 2015\n![](image)\nGiorgia Meloni  \nPrime Minister of Italy  \nsince 2022\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSee also: Italians, Italian diaspora, Genetic history of Italy, List of cities in Italy, and Racism in Italy\n\n![](image)Map of Italy's population density at the 2011 census\nAt the beginning of 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants.[367] The resulting population density, at 202 inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nItaly has probably the highest level of faunal biodiversity in Europe, with over 57,000 species recorded, representing more than a third of all European fauna,[214] and the highest level of biodiversity of both animal and plant species within the European Union.[215] Italy's varied geological structure contributes to its high climate and habitat diversity. The Italian peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, forming a corridor between central Europe and North Africa, and has 8,000 km (5,000 mi) of coastline. Italy also receives species from the Balkans, Eurasia, and the Middle East. Italy's varied geological structure, including the Alps and the Apennines, Central Italian woodlands, and Southern Italian Garigue and Maquis shrubland, also contribute to high climate and habitat diversity.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights\n* Commissioner on National Minorities\n* Representative on Freedom of the Media\n* Contact Point for Roma and Sinti Issues\n* OSCE Minsk Group\n |\n| Relations | * Armenia–OSCE relations\n* Azerbaijan–OSCE relations\n* List of ambassadors of Italy to OSCE\n* List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to the OSCE\n* United States Mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n |\n| Active field missions | * Presence in Albania\n* Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Mission in Kosovo\n* Mission to Montenegro\n* Mission to Moldova\n* Mission to Serbia\n* Mission to Skopje\n* Centre in Ashgabat\n* Programme Office in Astana\n* Programme Office in Bishkek\n* Programme Office in Dushanbe\n* Project Co-ordinator in Uzbekistan\n* Personal Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office on the Conflict Dealt with by the OSCE Minsk Conference\n |\n| Former field missions | * Needs Assessment Team in Armenia\n* Mission to Croatia\n* Kosovo Verification Mission\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAn autonomous corps of the military, the Carabinieri are the gendarmerie and military police of Italy, policing the military and civilian population alongside Italy's other police forces.

In 2014, challenged by the new Secretary of the PD Matteo Renzi, Letta resigned and was replaced by Renzi. The new government started constitutional reforms such as the abolition of the Senate and a new electoral law. On 4 December the constitutional reform was rejected in a referendum and Renzi resigned; the Foreign Affairs Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed new Prime Minister.[169]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFears of a possible Communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on 18 April 1948, when the Christian Democrats, under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi, obtained a landslide victory.[158][159] Consequently, in 1949 Italy became a member of NATO. The Marshall Plan helped to revive the Italian economy which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the \"Economic Miracle\". In the 1950s, Italy became one of the six founding countries of the European Communities, following the 1952 establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, and subsequent 1958 creations of the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community.

These seas constitute a reservoir of heat and humidity for Italy. Within the southern temperate zone, they determine a Mediterranean climate with local differences due to the geomorphology of the territory, which tends to make its mitigating effects felt, especially in high pressure conditions.[234]\n\n\nBecause of the length of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous hinterland, the climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic. The climate of the Po valley geographical region is mostly humid subtropical, with cool winters and hot summers.[235][236] The coastal areas of Liguria, Tuscany and most of the South generally fit the Mediterranean climate stereotype (Köppen climate classification).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Gran Paradiso, established in 1922, is the oldest Italian national park.\nMany watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity, while because of rising water levels, Venice has been regularly flooded throughout recent years. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas, as in the case of the Seveso disaster.\nThe country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but, after the Chernobyl disaster and a referendum on the issue the nuclear programme was terminated, a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008, planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with French technology. This was in turn struck down by a referendum following the Fukushima nuclear accident.[211]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most visited regions of Italy, measured by nights spent in tourist accommodation establishments, are Veneto, Tuscany, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Lazio.[362] Rome is the 3rd most visited city in Europe and the 12th in the world, with 9.4 million arrivals in 2017 while Milan is the 27th worldwide with 6.8 million tourists.[363] In addition, Venice and Florence are also among the world's top 100 destinations.\n\n\nItaly is also the country with the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world (58).[364] Out of Italy's 58 heritage sites, 53 are cultural and 5 are natural.[365] In Italy there is a broad variety of hotels, going from 1–5 stars. According to ISTAT, in 2017, there were 32,988 hotels with 1,133,452 rooms and 2,239,446 beds.[366] As for non-hotel facilities (campsites, tourist villages, accommodations for rent, agritourism, etc.), in 2017 their number was 171,915 with 2,798,352 beds.[366]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Exhausted nurse takes a break in an Italian hospital during the COVID-19 emergency\nIn the European migrant crisis of the 2010s, Italy was the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU. From 2013 to 2018, the country took in over 700,000 migrants and refugees,[170] mainly from sub-Saharan Africa,[171] which caused strain on the public purse and a surge in the support for far-right or euro-sceptic political parties.[172][173] The 2018 general election was characterised by a strong showing of the Five Star Movement and the League and the university professor Giuseppe Conte became the Prime Minister at the head of a populist coalition between these two parties.[174] However, after only fourteen months the League withdrew its support to Conte, who formed a new unprecedented government coalition between the Five Star Movement and the centre-left.[175][176]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwelve \"historical minority languages\" (*minoranze linguistiche storiche*) are formally recognised: Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian.[394] Four of these also enjoy a co-official status in their respective region: French in the Aosta Valley;[402] German in South Tyrol, and Ladin as well in some parts of the same province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino;[403] and Slovene in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine.[404] A number of other Ethnologue, ISO and UNESCO languages are not recognised by Italian law. Like France, Italy has signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, but has not ratified it.[405]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly is part of a monetary union, the eurozone, and of the European single market, which represents more than 500 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Italy introduced the common European currency, the euro in 2002.[287][288] It is a member of the eurozone which represents around 330 million citizens. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** The Holy See's sovereignty has been recognized explicitly in many international agreements and is particularly emphasized in article 2 of the Lateran Treaty of 11 February 1929, in which \"Italy recognizes the sovereignty of the Holy See in international matters as an inherent attribute in conformity with its traditions and the requirements of its mission to the world\" (Lateran Treaty, English translation).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A Ferrari SF21 by Scuderia Ferrari, the most successful Formula One team\nMotorsports are also extremely popular in Italy.[543] Italy has won, by far, the most MotoGP World Championships. Italian Scuderia Ferrari is the oldest surviving team in Grand Prix racing,[550] having competed since 1948, and statistically the most successful Formula One team in history with a record of 232 wins. The Italian Grand Prix of Formula 1 is the fifth oldest surviving Grand Prix, having been held since 1921.[551] It is also one of the two Grand Prix present in every championship since the first one in 1950.[552] Every Formula 1 Grand Prix (except for the 1980) has been held at Autodromo Nazionale Monza.[553] Formula 1 was also held at Imola (1980–2006, 2020) and Mugello (2020). Other successful Italian car manufacturers in motorsports are Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Maserati and Fiat.[554]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Italian Army is the national ground defence force. Its best-known combat vehicles are the Dardo infantry fighting vehicle, the Centauro tank destroyer and the Ariete tank, and among its aircraft the Mangusta attack helicopter, in the last years deployed in EU, NATO and UN missions. It also has at its disposal many Leopard 1 and M113 armoured vehicles. It was formed in 1946 from what remained of the *Regio Esercito* (\"Royal Army\", which was established on the occasion of the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, 1861) after World War II, when Italy became a republic following a referendum.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.[85] The four best known maritime republics were Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Amalfi; the others were Ancona, Gaeta, Noli, and Ragusa.[86][87][88] Each of the maritime republics had dominion over different overseas lands, including many Mediterranean islands (especially Sardinia and Corsica), lands on the Adriatic, Aegean, and Black Sea (Crimea), and commercial colonies in the Near East and in North Africa. Venice maintained enormous tracts of land in Greece, Cyprus, Istria, and Dalmatia until as late as the mid-17th century.[89]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![Map](image)\n*Left*: flag of the modern Italian Navy, displaying the coat of arms of Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Amalfi, the most prominent maritime republics  \n*Right*: trade routes and colonies of the Genoese (red) and Venetian (green) empires\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena is the world's oldest or second oldest bank in continuous operation, depending on the definition, and the fourth-largest Italian commercial and retail bank.[283] Italy has a strong cooperative sector, with the largest share of the population (4.5%) employed by a cooperative in the EU.[284] The Val d'Agri area, Basilicata, hosts the largest onshore hydrocarbon field in Europe.[285] Moderate natural gas reserves, mainly in the Po Valley and offshore Adriatic Sea, have been discovered in recent years and constitute the country's most important mineral resource. Italy is one of the world's leading producers of pumice, pozzolana, and feldspar.[286] Another notable mineral resource is marble, especially the world-famous white Carrara marble from the Massa and Carrara quarries in Tuscany.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTrieste has the highest percentage of researchers in Europe in relation to the population.[341] Italy was ranked 26th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[342] There are numerous technology parks in Italy such as the Science and Technology Parks Kilometro Rosso (Bergamo), the AREA Science Park (Trieste), The VEGA-Venice Gateway for Science and Technology (Venezia), the Toscana Life Sciences (Siena), the Technology Park of Lodi Cluster (Lodi), and the Technology Park of Navacchio (Pisa),[343] as well as science museums such as the Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci in Milan, the Città della Scienza in Naples and the Institute and Museum of the History of Science in Florence.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSolar energy production alone accounted for almost 9% of the total electric production in the country in 2014, making Italy the country with the highest contribution from solar energy in the world.[320] The Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station, completed in 2010, is the largest photovoltaic power station in Italy with 85 MW. Other examples of large PV plants in Italy are San Bellino (70.6 MW), Cellino san Marco (42.7 MW) and Sant' Alberto (34.6 MW).[323] Italy was the first country in the world to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity.[324] Italy had managed four nuclear reactors until the 1980s. However, nuclear power in Italy has been abandoned following a 1987 referendum (in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Soviet Ukraine), though Italy still imports nuclear energy from Italy-owned reactors in foreign territories.\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe flora of Italy was traditionally estimated to comprise about 5,500 vascular plant species.[223] However, as of 2005[update], 6,759 species are recorded in the *Data bank of Italian vascular flora*.[224] Italy has 1,371 endemic plant species and subspecies,[225] which include Sicilian Fir, Barbaricina columbine, Sea marigold, Lavender cotton and Ucriana violet. Italy is a signatory to the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and the Habitats Directive both affording protection to Italian fauna and flora.\n\n\nItaly has many botanical gardens and historic gardens, some of which are known outside the country.[226][227] The Italian garden is stylistically based on symmetry, axial geometry and on the principle of imposing order over nature. It influenced the history of gardening, especially French gardens and English gardens.[228] The Italian garden was influenced by Roman gardens and Italian Renaissance gardens.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Italian law enforcement system is complex, with multiple police forces.[249] The national policing agencies are the Polizia di Stato (State Police), the Arma dei Carabinieri, the Guardia di Finanza (Financial Guard), and the Polizia Penitenziaria (Prison Police),[250] as well as the Guardia Costiera (coast guard police).[249] Although policing in Italy is primarily provided on a national basis,[250] there also exists *Polizia Provinciale* (provincial police) and *Polizia Municipale* (municipal police).[249]\n\n\nItaly is regarded as being behind other Western European nations with regards to LGBT rights.[251] Additionally, Italy's law prohibiting torture is considered behind international standards.[252]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n274. **^** \"Italy fashion industry back to growth in 2014\". *Reuters*. 10 January 2014.

During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a number of courts competed to attract architects, artists and scholars, thus producing a legacy of monuments, paintings, music and literature. Despite the political and social isolation of these courts, Italy has made a substantial contribution to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe.[445]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Italy\n\n![](image)\nThe city of Venice, built on 117 islands\n![](image)\nThe Duomo and the Leaning Tower of Pisa\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince their appearance in the middle of the 19th century, Italian organised crime and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in Southern Italy, the most notorious of which being the Sicilian Mafia, which would later expand into some foreign countries including the United States. Mafia receipts may reach 9%[242][243] of Italy's GDP.[244]\n\n\nA 2009 report identified 610 *comuni* which have a strong Mafia presence, where 13 million Italians live and 14.6% of the Italian GDP is produced.[245][246] The Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, nowadays probably the most powerful crime syndicate of Italy, accounts alone for 3% of the country's GDP.[247] However, at 0.013 per 1,000 people, Italy has only the 47th highest murder rate[248] compared to 61 countries and the 43rd highest number of rapes per 1,000 people compared to 64 countries in the world.

During Craxi's government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth-largest industrial nation after it gained entry into the Group of Seven in the 1970s. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the country's GDP.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n405. **^** \"Ready for Ratification\".

The long history of this divided peninsula, now a unified nation-state, details the complex problems of underdeveloped areas in the South.[344] As expected, these problems of underdevelopment and poverty still linger today, also reflected in the concept of the digital divide between the North and South. The Global digital divide is broadly described as the technological differences between underdeveloped and developed countries. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Cushman-Roisin, Benoit; Gačić, Miroslav; Poulain, Pierre-Marie (2001). *Physical oceanography of the Adriatic Sea*.

The country has produced some well-known furniture designers, such as Gio Ponti and Ettore Sottsass, and Italian phrases such as *\"Bel Disegno\"* and *\"Linea Italiana\"* have entered the vocabulary of furniture design.[559] Examples of classic pieces of Italian white goods and pieces of furniture include Zanussi's washing machines and fridges,[560] the \"New Tone\" sofas by Atrium,[560] and the post-modern bookcase by Ettore Sottsass, inspired by Bob Dylan's song \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\".[560] Today, Milan and Turin are the nation's leaders in architectural design and industrial design. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers and as many civilians died,[127] and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy. The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) and the Treaty of Rapallo (1920) allowed the annexation of Trentino Alto-Adige, the Julian March, Istria and the Kvarner Gulf, as well as the Dalmatian city of Zara. The subsequent Treaty of Rome (1924) led to the annexation of the city of Fiume by Italy. Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London (1915), so this outcome was denounced as a \"mutilated victory\". The rhetoric of \"mutilated victory\" was adopted by Benito Mussolini and led to the rise of Italian fascism, becoming a key point in the propaganda of Fascist Italy. Historians regard \"mutilated victory\" as a \"political myth\", used by fascists to fuel Italian imperialism and obscure the successes of liberal Italy in the aftermath of World War I.[128] Italy also gained a permanent seat in the League of Nations's executive council.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Olive oil and vegetables are central to the Mediterranean diet.[431]\nLife expectancy in the country is 80 for males and 85 for females, placing the country 5th in the world.[432] In comparison to other Western countries, Italy has a relatively low rate of adult obesity (below 10%[433]), as there are several health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.[434] The proportion of daily smokers was 22% in 2012, down from 24.4% in 2000 but still slightly above the OECD average.[435] Smoking in public places including bars, restaurants, night clubs and offices has been restricted to specially ventilated rooms since 2005.[436] In 2013, UNESCO added the Mediterranean diet to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of Italy (promoter), Morocco, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Croatia.[437][438]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n223. **^** Pignatti, S.

Nevertheless, by his time the larger concept of Oenotria and \"Italy\" had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of Lucania as well. According to Strabo's *Geographica*, before the expansion of the Roman Republic, the name was used by ancient Greeks to indicate the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto, corresponding roughly to the current region of Calabria. The ancient Greeks gradually came to apply the name \"Italia\" to a larger region[42] In addition to the \"Greek Italy\" in the south, historians have suggested the existence of an \"Etruscan Italy\" covering variable areas of central Italy.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStarting in the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing under its rule Eritrea and Somalia in East Africa, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica in North Africa (later unified in the colony of Libya) and the Dodecanese islands.[120] From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance forces during the Boxer Rebellion in China; on 7 September 1901, a concession in Tientsin was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a consul. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by Giovanni Giolitti, Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterised by the economic, industrial, and political-cultural modernization of Italian society.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Aristocracy\n* Censorship\n* Corruption\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Education\n* Emigration and diaspora\n* Gambling\n* Health\n* Healthcare\n* Immigration\n* Inventions and discoveries\n* Italians\n\t+ People\n* Languages\n\t+ Italian\n\t\t- Regional\n* Life expectancy\n* Orders, decorations, and medals\n* Poverty\n* Prostitution\n* Public administration\n* Racism\n* Religion\n* Social class\n* Terrorism\n* Water supply and sanitation\n* Women\n |\n| Culture | * Duecento\n* Trecento\n* Quattrocento\n* Cinquecento\n* Seicento\n* Settecento\n* Ottocento\n* Anthem\n* Architecture\n* Art\n* Castles\n* Cathedrals\n* Cinema\n* Coat of arm\n* Cuisine\n* Design\n* Fashion\n* Flag\n* Folklore\n* Gardens\n* Internet\n* Italophilia\n* Libraries\n* Literature\n* Media\n* Museums\n* Music\n* Mythology\n* National symbols\n* Palaces\n* Philosophy\n* Public holidays\n* Sport\n* Television\n* Theatre\n* Traditions\n* World Heritage Sites\n |\n\n |\n| * ![flag](image) Italy portal\n* ![](image) Category\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nItalian Fascism is based upon Italian nationalism and imperialism, and in particular seeks to complete what it considers as the incomplete project of the unification of Italy by incorporating *Italia Irredenta* (unredeemed Italy) into the state of Italy.[131][132] To the east of Italy, the Fascists claimed that Dalmatia was a land of Italian culture whose Italians, including those of Italianized South Slavic descent, had been driven out of Dalmatia and into exile in Italy, and supported the return of Italians of Dalmatian heritage.[133] Mussolini identified Dalmatia as having strong Italian cultural roots for centuries, similarly to Istria, via the Roman Empire and the Republic of Venice.[134] To the south of Italy, the Fascists claimed Malta, which belonged to the United Kingdom, and Corfu, which instead belonged to Greece; to the north claimed Italian Switzerland, while to the west claimed Corsica, Nice, and Savoy, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n152. **^** Adrian Lyttelton (editor), *\"Liberal and fascist Italy, 1900–1945\"*, Oxford University Press, 2002. p. 13\n153. **^** \"Italia\", *Dizionario enciclopedico italiano* (in Italian), vol. VI, Treccani, 1970, p. 456\n154. **^** *Damage Foreshadows A-Bomb Test, 1946/06/06 (1946)*.

Milan, Florence and Rome are Italy's main fashion capitals. According to *Top Global Fashion Capital Rankings* 2013 by Global Language Monitor, Rome ranked sixth worldwide while Milan was twelfth. Previously, in 2009, Milan was declared the \"fashion capital of the world\" by Global Language Monitor itself.[556] Major Italian fashion labels, such as Gucci, Armani, Prada, Versace, Valentino, Dolce & Gabbana, Missoni, Fendi, Moschino, Max Mara, Trussardi, and Ferragamo, to name a few, are regarded as among the finest fashion houses in the world. Jewellers like Bvlgari, Damiani and Buccellati have been founded in Italy. Also, the fashion magazine Vogue Italia, is considered one of the most prestigious fashion magazines in the world.[557] The talent of young, creative fashion is also promoted, as in the ITS young fashion designer competition in Trieste.[558]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly is the world's largest wine producer,[306] and one of the leading in olive oil, fruits (apples, olives, grapes, oranges, lemons, pears, apricots, hazelnuts, peaches, cherries, plums, strawberries and kiwifruits), and vegetables (especially artichokes and tomatoes). The most famous Italian wines are probably the Tuscan Chianti and the Piedmontese Barolo. Other famous wines are Barbaresco, Barbera d'Asti, Brunello di Montalcino, Frascati, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Morellino di Scansano, and the sparkling wines Franciacorta and Prosecco.\n\n\nQuality goods in which Italy specialises, particularly the already mentioned wines and regional cheeses, are often protected under the quality assurance labels DOC/DOP. This geographical indication certificate, which is attributed by the European Union, is considered important in order to avoid confusion with low-quality mass-produced ersatz products.\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Italy\n\nSee also: Railway stations in Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n378. **^** \"Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Uruguay, provinces and territories – 20% sample data\".

The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the \"Big Four\" top Allied powers. The war on the Italian Front was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long attrition war in the Alps, making little progress and suffering heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '*99 Boys* (*Ragazzi del '99*, all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian victories in major battles, such as on Monte Grappa and in a series of battles on the Piave river. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of Vittorio Veneto. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The signing ceremony of the Treaty of Rome on 25 March 1957, creating the European Economic Community, forerunner of the present-day European Union\nFrom the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the Years of Lead, a period characterised by economic crisis, especially after the 1973 oil crisis, widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups, with the alleged involvement of US and Soviet intelligence.[160][161][162] The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro in 1978 and the Bologna railway station massacre in 1980, where 85 people died.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Trieste, the main port of the northern Adriatic and starting point of the Transalpine Pipeline\nThe national railway network, state-owned and operated by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (FSI), in 2008 totalled 16,529 km (10,271 mi) of which 11,727 km (7,287 mi) is electrified, and on which 4,802 locomotives and railcars run.

However, the Northern Italy monarchy of the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Sardinia, whose government was led by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. In the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful first war of independence was declared on Austria. In 1855, the Kingdom of Sardinia became an ally of Britain and France in the Crimean War, giving Cavour's diplomacy legitimacy in the eyes of the great powers.[115][116] The Kingdom of Sardinia again attacked the Austrian Empire in the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859, with the aid of France, resulting in liberating Lombardy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Victor Emmanuel II Monument in Rome, a national symbol of Italy celebrating the first king of the unified country, and resting place of the Italian Unknown Soldier since the end of World War I.

The Lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the Frankish Empire by Charlemagne in the late 8th century and became the Kingdom of Italy.[80] The Franks also helped the formation of the Papal States in central Italy. Until the 13th century, Italian politics was dominated by the relations between the Holy Roman Emperors and the Papacy, with most of the Italian city-states siding with the former (Ghibellines) or with the latter (Guelphs) for momentary convenience.[81]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly is the most awarded country at the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, with 14 awards won, 3 Special Awards and 28 nominations.[534] As of 2016[update], Italian films have also won 12 Palmes d'Or,[535] 11 Golden Lions[536] and 7 Golden Bears.[537] The list of the 100 Italian films to be saved was created with the aim to report \"100 films that have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978\".[538]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Italy\n\n![](image)The *Azzurri* in 2012.

The peninsula was therefore divided as follows: northern Italy and Tuscany formed the Lombard kingdom, with its capital in Pavia, while in central-southern Italy the Lombards controlled the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** Carlà-Uhink, Filippo (25 September 2017). *The \"Birth\" of Italy: The Institutionalization of Italy as a Region, 3rd–1st Century BCE*.

In propaganda, Fascists used the ancient Roman motto \"*Mare Nostrum*\" (Latin for \"Our Sea\") to describe the Mediterranean. For this reason the Fascist regime engaged in interventionist foreign policy. In 1923, the Greek island of Corfu was briefly occupied by Italy, after the assassination of General Tellini in Greek territory. In 1925, Italy forced Albania to become a *de facto* protectorate. In 1935, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and founded Italian East Africa, resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations; Italy allied with Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan and strongly supported Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war. In 1939, Italy formally annexed Albania. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the north, the Germans set up the Italian Social Republic (RSI), a Nazi puppet state with Mussolini installed as leader after he was rescued by German paratroopers. Some Italian troops in the south were organised into the Italian Co-belligerent Army, which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army. Also, the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the *Resistenza*.[145] As result, the country descended into civil war;[146][147] the Italian resistance fought a guerrilla war against the Nazi German occupiers and Italian Fascist forces,[145] while clashes between the Fascist RSI Army and the Royalist Italian Co-Belligerent Army were rare.[148] In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north,[149] but was captured and summarily executed near Lake Como by Italian partisans. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIntroduced in the early 1920s, jazz took a particularly strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the progressive rock and pop movement of the 1970s, with bands like PFM, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Le Orme, Goblin, and Pooh.[506] The same period saw diversification in the cinema of Italy, and Cinecittà films included complex scores by composers including Ennio Morricone, Armando Trovaioli, Piero Piccioni and Piero Umiliani. In the early 1980s, the first star to emerge from the Italian hip hop scene was singer Jovanotti.[507] Italian metal bands include Rhapsody of Fire, Lacuna Coil, Elvenking, Forgotten Tomb, and Fleshgod Apocalypse.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Italian Peninsula, named Italia, was consolidated into a single entity during the Roman expansion and conquest of new lands at the expense of the other Italic tribes, Etruscans, Celts, and Greeks. A permanent association with most of the local tribes and cities was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. In the wake of Julius Caesar's rise and death in the first century BC, Rome grew over the course of centuries into a massive empire stretching from Britain to the borders of Persia, and engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin, in which Greek and Roman and many other cultures merged into a unique civilisation. The long and triumphant reign of the first emperor, Augustus, began a golden age of peace and prosperity. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"La riorganizzazione amministrativa dell'Italia.

In 1922, following a period of crisis and turmoil, the Italian fascist dictatorship was established. During World War II, Italy was first part of the Axis until it surrendered to the Allied powers (1940-1943) and then, as part of its territory was occupied by Nazi Germany with fascist collaboration, a co-belligerent of the Allies during the Italian resistance and the liberation of Italy (1943-1945). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s. Following the European wars of succession of the 18th century, the North fell under the influence of the Habsburg-Lorraine of Austria, while the south passed to a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons. During the Coalition Wars, northern and central Italy was reorganised by Napoleon in a number of Sister Republics of France and later as a Kingdom of Italy in personal union with the French Empire.[103] The southern half of the peninsula was administered by Joachim Murat, Napoleon's brother-in-law, who was crowned as King of Naples. The 1814 Congress of Vienna restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the French Revolution could not be eradicated, and soon re-surfaced during the political upheavals that characterised the first part of the 19th century.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItalian meal structure is typical of the European Mediterranean region and differs from North, Central, and Eastern European meal structure, though it still often consists of breakfast (*colazione*), lunch (*pranzo*), and dinner (*cena*).[579] However, much less emphasis is placed on breakfast, and breakfast itself is often skipped or involves lighter meal portions than are seen in non-Mediterranean Western countries.[580] Late-morning and mid-afternoon snacks, called *merenda* (plural *merende*), are also often included in this meal structure.[581]\n\n\nThe marketing phenomenon consisting of words and images, colour combinations (the Italian tricolour) and geographical references for brands that are evocative of Italy to promote and market agri-food products that have nothing to do with Italian cuisine is known by the name of *Italian Sounding*.[582]\n\n\n\n### Public holidays, festivals and folklore[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Public holidays in Italy, Traditions of Italy, and Folklore of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes Leo X (1513–1521) and Clement VII (1523–1534) opposed the Protestant reformation and advanced the interests of their family.

Another source of immigration is neighbouring North Africa (in particular, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia), with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the Arab Spring.

After the Lombard invasions, \"Italia\" was retained as the name for their kingdom, and for its successor kingdom within the Holy Roman Empire, which nominally lasted until 1806, although it had *de facto* disintegrated due to factional politics pitting the empire against the ascendant city republics in the 13th century.[57]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Italy\n\n### Prehistory and antiquity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n135. **^** Aristotle A.

In Italy artists like Paolo Uccello, Fra Angelico, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna, Filippo Lippi, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Titian took painting to a higher level through the use of perspective, the study of human anatomy and proportion, and through their development of refined drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was active as a sculptor from about 1500 to 1520; his works include his *David*, *Pietà*, *Moses*. Other Renaissance sculptors include Lorenzo Ghiberti, Luca Della Robbia, Donatello, Filippo Brunelleschi and Andrea del Verrocchio.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther astronomers such as Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625–1712) and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835–1910) made discoveries about the Solar System. In mathematics, Joseph Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736–1813) was active before leaving Italy. Fibonacci (c. 1170 – c. 1250), and Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576) made fundamental advances in mathematics.[332] Luca Pacioli established accounting to the world. Physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–1954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the first nuclear reactor. He is considered the \"architect of the nuclear age\"[330] and the \"architect of the atomic bomb\".[331] He, Emilio G. Segrè (1905–1989) who discovered the elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton), Bruno Rossi (1905–1993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by Fascist laws against Jews.[333]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families such as the Medici in Florence, the Visconti and Sforza in the Duchy of Milan, the Doria in the Republic of Genoa, the Loredan, Mocenigo and Barbarigo in the Republic of Venice, the Este in Ferrara, and the Gonzaga in Mantua.[93][94] The Renaissance was therefore a result of the wealth accumulated by Italian merchant cities combined with the patronage of its dominant families.[93] Italian Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards, with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto, Donatello, and Titian, and architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi, Leon Battista Alberti, Andrea Palladio, and Donato Bramante.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe birth of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula. By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism, along with other social, economic, and military events, led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval.[111] Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the political and social Italian unification movement, or *Risorgimento*, emerged to unite Italy consolidating the different states of the peninsula and liberate it from foreign control. A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist Giuseppe Mazzini, member of the secret revolutionary society *Carbonari* and founder of the influential political movement Young Italy in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement. His prolific output of propaganda helped the unification movement stay active.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Fascist regime[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Italian fascism, Fascist Italy (1922–1943), Italian irredentism, Military history of Italy during World War II, Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, and Italian Civil War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Flag of the Cispadane Republic, which was the first Italian tricolour adopted by a sovereign Italian state (1797)\nThe Papacy remained a powerful force and launched the Counter-reformation.

The main historic peoples of possible non-Indo-European or pre-Indo-European heritage include the Etruscans of central and northern Italy, the Elymians and the Sicani in Sicily, and the prehistoric Sardinians, who gave birth to the Nuragic civilisation. Other ancient populations being of undetermined language families and of possible non-Indo-European origin include the Rhaetian people and Cammuni, known for their rock carvings in Valcamonica, the largest collections of prehistoric petroglyphs in the world.[63] A well-preserved natural mummy known as Ötzi the Iceman, determined to be 5,000 years old (between 3400 and 3100 BCE, Copper Age), was discovered in the Similaun glacier of South Tyrol in 1991.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nItaly was the birthplace and heart of the Renaissance during the 1400s and 1500s. The Italian Renaissance marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age as Europe recovered, economically and culturally, from the crises of the Late Middle Ages and entered the Early Modern Period. The Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by Princes, *de facto* monarchs in control of trade and administration, and their courts became major centres of the arts and sciences. The Italian princedoms represented a first form of modern states as opposed to feudal monarchies and multinational empires. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe most notable among them were: Christopher Columbus (Italian: *Cristoforo Colombo*), colonizer in the name of Spain, who is credited with discovering the New World and the opening of the Americas for conquest and settlement by Europeans;[99] John Cabot (Italian: *Giovanni Caboto*), sailing for England, who was the first European to set foot in \"New Found Land\" and explore parts of the North American continent in 1497;[100] Amerigo Vespucci, sailing for Portugal, who first demonstrated in about 1501 that the New World (in particular Brazil) was not Asia as initially conjectured, but a fourth continent previously unknown to people of the Old World (America is named after him);[101] and Giovanni da Verrazzano, at the service of France, renowned as the first European to explore the Atlantic coast of North America between Florida and New Brunswick in 1524.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the fall of Constantinople, the wars in Lombardy came to an end and a defensive alliance known as Italic League was formed between Venice, Naples, Florence, Milan, and the Papacy. Lorenzo *the Magnificent* de Medici was the greatest Florentine patron of the Renaissance and supporter of the Italic League. He notably avoided the collapse of the League in the aftermath of the Pazzi Conspiracy and during the aborted invasion of Italy by the Turks. However, the military campaign of Charles VIII of France in Italy caused the end of the Italic League and initiated the Italian Wars between the Valois and the Habsburgs. During the High Renaissance of the 1500s, Italy was therefore both the main European battleground and the cultural-economic centre of the continent. Popes such as Julius II (1503–1513) fought for the control of Italy against foreign monarchs, others such as Paul III (1534–1549) preferred to mediate between the European powers in order to secure peace in Italy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** J.P.

They were independent thalassocratic city-states, though most of them originated from territories once belonging to the Byzantine Empire. All these cities during the time of their independence had similar systems of government in which the merchant class had considerable power. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther prominent physicists include: Amedeo Avogadro (most noted for his contributions to molecular theory, in particular, the Avogadro's law and the Avogadro constant), Evangelista Torricelli (inventor of barometer), Alessandro Volta (inventor of electric battery), Guglielmo Marconi (inventor of radio), Galileo Ferraris and Antonio Pacinotti, pioneers of the induction motor, Alessandro Cruto, pioneer of light bulb and Innocenzo Manzetti, eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, Ettore Majorana (who discovered the Majorana fermions), Carlo Rubbia (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the W and Z particles at CERN).

The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy.

In October 1922 the Blackshirts of the National Fascist Party attempted a mass demonstration and a coup named the \"March on Rome\" which failed but at the last minute, King Victor Emmanuel III refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister, thereby transferring political power to the fascists without armed conflict.[129][130] Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a dictatorship.

In Sardinia, the former Byzantine provinces became independent states known in Italian as Judicates, although some parts of the island fell under Genoese or Pisan rule until eventual Aragonese annexation in the 15th century. The Black Death pandemic of 1348 left its mark on Italy by killing perhaps one third of the population.[91][92]\n\n\n\n### Early Modern[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Italian Renaissance, Italian Wars, and History of Italy (1559–1814)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Italian victory,[124][125][126] which was announced by the *Bollettino della Vittoria* and the *Bollettino della Vittoria Navale*, marked the end of the war on the Italian Front, secured the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was chiefly instrumental in ending the First World War less than two weeks later. Italian armed forces were also involved in the African theatre, the Balkan theatre, the Middle Eastern theatre, and then took part in the Occupation of Constantinople.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnarcho-communism first fully formed into its modern strain within the Italian section of the First International.[484] Antonio Gramsci remains a relevant philosopher within Marxist and communist theory, credited with creating the theory of cultural hegemony. Italian philosophers were also influential in the development of the non-Marxist liberal socialism philosophy, including Carlo Rosselli, Norberto Bobbio, Piero Gobetti and Aldo Capitini. In the 1960s, many Italian left-wing activists adopted the anti-authoritarian pro-working class leftist theories that would become known as autonomism and *operaismo*.[485]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Luciano Pavarotti, considered one of the finest tenors of the 20th century and the \"King of the High Cs\"[504]\nItaly is widely known for being the birthplace of opera.[505] Italian opera was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century, in cities such as Mantua and Venice.[505] Later, works and pieces composed by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are among the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. La Scala opera house in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include Enrico Caruso and Alessandro Bonci.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlong with pre-historic architecture, the first people in Italy to truly begin a sequence of designs were the Greeks and the Etruscans, progressing to classical Roman,[447] then to the revival of the classical Roman era during the Renaissance and evolving into the Baroque era. The Christian concept of a Basilica, a style of church architecture that came to dominate the early Middle Ages, was invented in Rome. They were known for being long, rectangular buildings, which were built in an almost ancient Roman style, often rich in mosaics and decorations. The early Christians' art and architecture were also widely inspired by that of the pagan Romans; statues, mosaics and paintings decorated all their churches.[448]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nCastel del Monte, Apulia\n![](image)\nThe Royal Palace of Caserta\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Fascist period, the so-called \"Novecento movement\" flourished, based on the rediscovery of imperial Rome, with figures such as Gio Ponti and Giovanni Muzio. Marcello Piacentini, responsible for the urban transformations of several cities in Italy and remembered for the disputed Via della Conciliazione in Rome, devised a form of simplified Neoclassicism.[455]\n\n\n\n### Visual art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian art\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n333. **^** Lucia Orlando, \"Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the\" New Tasks\" of Physics in Italy.\" *Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences* (1998): 141–181.

Italian physician and educator Maria Montessori is credited with the creation of the philosophy of education that bears her name, an educational philosophy now practised throughout the world.[478] Giuseppe Peano was one of the founders of analytic philosophy and the contemporary philosophy of mathematics. Recent analytic philosophers include Carlo Penco, Gloria Origgi, Pieranna Garavaso and Luciano Floridi.[473]\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theatre of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Funerals of the victims of the Bologna bombing of 2 August 1980, the deadliest attack ever perpetrated in Italy during the Years of Lead\nItaly faced several terror attacks between 1992 and 1993 perpetrated by the Sicilian Mafia as a consequence of several life sentences pronounced during the \"Maxi Trial\", and of the new anti-mafia measures launched by the government. In 1992, two major dynamite attacks killed the judges Giovanni Falcone (23 May in the Capaci bombing) and Paolo Borsellino (19 July in the Via D'Amelio bombing).[163] One year later (May–July 1993), tourist spots were attacked, such as the Via dei Georgofili in Florence, Via Palestro in Milan, and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano and Via San Teodoro in Rome, leaving 10 dead and 93 injured and causing severe damage to cultural heritage such as the Uffizi Gallery. The Catholic Church openly condemned the Mafia, and two churches were bombed and an anti-Mafia priest shot dead in Rome.[164][165][166]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the conclusion of the western schism in favour of Rome at the Council of Constance (1415–1417), the new Pope Martin V returned to the Papal States after a three years-long journey that touched many Italian cities and restored Italy as the sole centre of Western Christianity. During the course of this voyage, the Medici Bank was made the official credit institution of the Papacy, and several significant ties were established between the Church and the new political dynasties of the peninsula. The Popes' status as elective monarchs turned the conclaves and consistories of the Renaissance into political battles between the courts of Italy for primacy in the peninsula and access to the immense resources of the Catholic Church. In 1439, Pope Eugenius IV and the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos signed a reconciliation agreement between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church at the Council of Florence hosted by Cosimo *the old* de Medici. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Venice Film Festival is the oldest film festival in the world.[588]\nThe Italian national patronal day, on 4 October, celebrates Saints Francis and Catherine. Each city or town also celebrates a public holiday on the occasion of the festival of the local patron saint,[584] for example: Rome on 29 June (Saints Peter and Paul), Milan on 7 December (Saint Ambrose), Naples on 19 September (Saint Januarius), Venice on 25 April (Saint Mark the Evangelist) and Florence on 24 June (Saint John the Baptist).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first foreign colonisers were the Phoenicians, who initially established colonies and founded various emporiums on the coasts of Sicily and Sardinia. Some of these soon became small urban centres and were developed parallel to the ancient Greek colonies; among the main centres there were the cities of Motya, Zyz (modern Palermo), Soluntum in Sicily, and Nora, Sulci, and Tharros in Sardinia.[65]\n\n\nBetween the 17th and the 11th centuries BC Mycenaean Greeks established contacts with Italy.[66][67][68] In the 8th and 7th centuries BC a number of Greek colonies were established starting at Pithecusae and eventually extending all along the southern part of the Italian Peninsula and the coast of Sicily, an area that later became known as Magna Graecia.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRome, a settlement around a ford on the river Tiber in central Italy conventionally founded in 753 BC, was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system, initially with sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin, later by Etruscan kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius and Tarquinius Superbus. In 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city, favouring a government of the Senate and the People (SPQR) and establishing an oligarchic republic.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Italian peninsula was historically the native place and destination of numerous ancient peoples.[19] The Latin city of Rome in central Italy, founded as a Kingdom, became a Republic that conquered the Mediterranean world and ruled it for centuries as an Empire.[20][21] With the spread of Christianity, Rome became the seat of the Catholic Church and of the Papacy. During the Early Middle Ages, Italy experienced the fall of the Western Roman Empire and inward migration from Germanic tribes. By the 11th century, Italian city-states and maritime republics expanded, bringing renewed prosperity through commerce and laying the groundwork for modern capitalism.[22][23] The Italian Renaissance flourished in Florence during the 15th and 16th centuries and spread to the rest of Europe. Italian explorers also discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGigliola Cinquetti, Toto Cutugno, and Måneskin won the Eurovision Song Contest, in 1964, 1990, and 2021 respectively.\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n523. **^** Katz, Ephraim (2001), \"Italy\", *The Film Encyclopedia*, HarperResource, pp. 682–685, ISBN 978-0060742140\n524. **^** Brunetta, Gian Piero (2002). *Storia del cinema mondiale* (in Italian).

The main Sensist Italian philosophers were Melchiorre Gioja and Gian Domenico Romagnosi.[482] Criticism of the Sensist movement came from other philosophers such as Pasquale Galluppi (1770–1846), who affirmed that *a priori* relationships were synthetic.[482] Antonio Rosmini, instead, was the founder of Italian idealism. During the late 19th and 20th centuries, there were also several other movements which gained some form of popularity in Italy, such as Ontologism (whose main philosopher was Vincenzo Gioberti),[483] anarchism, communism, socialism, futurism, fascism and Christian democracy. Giovanni Gentile and Benedetto Croce were two of the most significant 20th-century Idealist philosophers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n453. **^** Hersey, George (2001). *Architecture and Geometry in the Age of the Baroque*.

The most original work of all late Baroque and Rococo architecture is the Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi, dating back to the 18th century.[452] Luigi Vanvitelli began in 1752 the construction of the Royal Palace of Caserta. In this large complex, the grandiose Baroque-style interiors and gardens are opposed to a more sober building envelope.[453] In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Italy was affected by the Neoclassical architectural movement. Villas, palaces, gardens, interiors and art began to be based on Roman and Greek themes.[454]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 19th century, major Italian Romantic painters were Francesco Hayez, Giuseppe Bezzuoli and Francesco Podesti. Impressionism was brought from France to Italy by the *Macchiaioli*, led by Giovanni Fattori, and Giovanni Boldini; Realism by Gioacchino Toma and Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo. In the 20th century, with Futurism, primarily through the works of Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla, Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico, who exerted a strong influence on the Surrealists and generations of artists to follow like Bruno Caruso and Renato Guttuso.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian literature\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n460. **^** Brand, Peter; Pertile, Lino, eds.

The lyric poet Torquato Tasso in *Jerusalem Delivered* wrote a Christian epic in *ottava rima*, with attention to the Aristotelian canons of unity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Ballet dance genre also originated in Italy. It began during the Italian Renaissance court as an outgrowth of court pageantry,[499] where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations. Court musicians and dancers collaborated to provide elaborate entertainment for them.[500] At first, ballets were woven into the midst of an opera to allow the audience a moment of relief from the dramatic intensity. By the mid-seventeenth century, Italian ballets in their entirety were performed in between the acts of an opera. Over time, Italian ballets became part of theatrical life: ballet companies in Italy's major opera houses employed an average of four to twelve dancers; in 1815 many companies employed anywhere from eighty to one hundred dancers.[501]\n\n\nThe Teatro di San Carlo in Naples is the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world, opening in 1737, decades before both Milan's La Scala and Venice's La Fenice theatres.[486]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Dante Alighieri, one of the greatest poets of the Middle Ages.

One of these poets was the notary Giacomo da Lentini, inventor of the sonnet form, though the most famous early sonneteer was Petrarch.[462]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_W7dG3BdyBYVURuPKQMy8WfDw","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It is in the northwest Pacific Ocean and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 14,125 islands, with the five main islands being Hokkaido, Honshu (the \"mainland\"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.\n\n\nJapan has over 125 million inhabitants and is the 11th most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its highly urbanized population on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Japan has the world's highest life expectancy, though it is experiencing a population decline due to its very low birth rate.\n\n\nJapan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC). Between the fourth and ninth centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and the imperial court based in Heian-kyō. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (*shōgun*) and feudal lords (*daimyō*), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (*samurai*). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-modeled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. Amidst a rise in militarism and overseas colonization, Japan invaded China in 1937 and entered World War II as an Axis power in 1941. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution.\n\n\nUnder the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. Japan is a developed country and a great power, with one of the largest economies by nominal GDP. Japan has renounced its right to declare war, though it maintains a Self-Defense Force that ranks as one of the world's strongest militaries. A global leader in the automotive, robotics, and electronics industries, the country has made significant contributions to science and technology, and is one of the world's largest exporters and importers. It is part of multiple major international and intergovernmental institutions.\n\n\nJapan is considered a cultural superpower as the culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, film, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent manga, anime, and video game industries.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Japan\n\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji 日本 and is pronounced *Nippon* or *Nihon*.[12] Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as *Wa* (倭, changed in Japan around 757 to 和) and in Japan by the endonym *Yamato*.[13] *Nippon*, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on Japanese banknotes and postage stamps.[12] *Nihon* is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period.[13] The characters 日本 mean \"sun origin\",[12] which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".[14]\n\n\nThe name \"Japan\" is based on Chinese pronunciations of 日本 and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters 日本國 as *Cipangu*.[15] The old Malay name for Japan, *Japang* or *Japun*, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.[16] The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as *Giapan* in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Japan\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Japanese history.\n\n### Prehistoric to classical history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Legendary Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇, *Jinmu-tennō*)\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan.[19] This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.[20] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery.[21] From around 700 BC, the Japonic-speaking Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula,[22][23][24] intermingling with the Jōmon;[24] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming,[25] a new style of pottery,[26] and metallurgy from China and Korea.[27] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.[28]\n\n\nJapan first appears in written history in the Chinese *Book of Han*, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[29] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Shōtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).[30]\n\n\nIn 645, the government led by Prince Naka no Ōe and Fujiwara no Kamatari devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China.[31] It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[32] The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of China. Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn about Chinese writing, politics, art, and religion.[31] The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince Ōama and his nephew Prince Ōtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[33] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taihō Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments.[32] These legal reforms created the *ritsuryō* state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[33]\n\n\nThe Nara period (710–784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the *Kojiki* (712) and *Nihon Shoki* (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture.[34][35] A smallpox epidemic in 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[35][36] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyoto) in 794.[35] This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's *The Tale of Genji* and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem *\"Kimigayo\"* were written during this time.[37]\n\n\n\n### Feudal era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japanese samurai boarding a Mongol vessel during the Mongol invasions of Japan, depicted in the *Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba*, 1293\n![](image)Three unifiers of Japan. Left to right: Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai.[38] In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan by the Minamoto clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura.[39] After Yoritomo's death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the *shōgun*.[35] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class.[40] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo.[35] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336–1573).[41] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (*daimyō*) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").[42]\n\n\nDuring the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.[35][43] Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other *daimyō*;[44] his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi–Momoyama period.[45] After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.[35]\n\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support.[46] When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed *shōgun* by Emperor Go-Yōzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo).[47] The shogunate enacted measures including *buke shohatto*, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous *daimyō*,[48] and in 1639 the isolationist *sakoku* (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603–1868).[47][49] Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.[50] The study of Western sciences (*rangaku*) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki.[47] The Edo period gave rise to *kokugaku* (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.[51]\n\n\n\n### Modern era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nEmperor Meiji (明治天皇, *Meiji-tennō*); 1852–1912\n![](image)\nThe Japanese Empire in 1942\n\nThe United States Navy sent Commodore Matthew C. Perry to force the opening of Japan to the outside world. Arriving at Uraga with four \"Black Ships\" in July 1853, the Perry Expedition resulted in the March 1854 Convention of Kanagawa.[47] Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises.[47] The resignation of the *shōgun* led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration).[52] Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution (November 29, 1890), and assembled the Imperial Diet.[53] During the Meiji period (1868–1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.[54][55][56] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin.[57][53] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.[58][59]\n\n\nThe early 20th century saw a period of Taishō democracy (1912–1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization.[60][61] World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China.[61] The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups.[59][62][63] This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning several radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later.[64] In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Japan's imperial ambitions ended on September 2, 1945, with the country's surrender to the Allies.\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).[65] In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.[59][66] On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific.[67] Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery.[68] After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender.[69] The war cost Japan its colonies and millions of lives.[59] The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese Empire and its influence over the territories it conquered.[70][71] The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.[71]\n\n\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices.[71] The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952,[72] and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956.[71] A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world;[71] this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\".[73] In 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[74] On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the *Reiwa* era.[75]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Japan and Geology of Japan\n\n![](image)A topographic map of Japan\nJapan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia.[76] It stretches over 3000 km (1900 mi) northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.[77][78] The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa.[79] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.[80] As of 2019[update], Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi).[4] Japan has the sixth-longest coastline in the world at 29,751 km (18,486 mi). Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the eighth-largest exclusive economic zone in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).[81][82]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago is 67% forests and 14% agricultural.[83] The primarily rugged and mountainous terrain is restricted for habitation.[84] Thus the habitable zones, mainly in the coastal areas, have very high population densities: Japan is the 40th most densely populated country.[85][86] Honshu has the highest population density at 450 persons/km2 (1200/sq mi) as of 2010[update], while Hokkaido has the lowest density of 64.5 persons/km2 as of 2016[update].[87] As of 2014[update], approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (*umetatechi*).[88] Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and the country's largest freshwater lake.[89]\n\n\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic eruptions because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[90] It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index.[91] Japan has 111 active volcanoes.[92] Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century;[93] the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.[94] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.[74]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Japan § Climate\n\n![](image)Mount Fuji in Spring, view from Arakurayama Sengen Park\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.[95]\n\n\nIn the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn.[96] The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.[95]\n\n\nThe Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.[95] The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.[97] According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.[98] The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1 °C (106.0 °F), was recorded on July 23, 2018,[99] and repeated on August 17, 2020.[100]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Japan\n\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.[101] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019[update],[102] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.[103]\n\n\nA large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 52 Ramsar wetland sites.[104][105] Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.[106]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Japan and Climate change in Japan\n\n![](image)Autumn maple leaves (*momiji*) at Kongōbu-ji on Mount Kōya, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concerns, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970.[107] The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.[108]\n\n\nJapan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.[109] Japan is the world's fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide.[98] As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.[110] In 2020 the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050.[111] Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.[112]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Emperor of Japan, Government of Japan, Politics of Japan, and Law of Japan\n\n![](image)Emperor Naruhito, current head of state, and Empress Masako participated in the Imperial Procession by motorcar after the Ceremony of the Enthronement in Tokyo on November 10, 2019.\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role.[113] Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.[114] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)The National Diet Building\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament.[113] It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms.[115] There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age,[116] with a secret ballot for all elected offices.[114] The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet.[115] Fumio Kishida is Japan's prime minister; he took office after winning the 2021 Liberal Democratic Party leadership election.[117] The right-wing big tent Liberal Democratic Party has been the dominant party in the country since the 1950s, often called the 1955 System.[118]\n\n\nHistorically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as *Kujikata Osadamegaki*.[119] Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post–World War II modifications.[120] The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world.[121] Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[119] Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.[122]\n\n\nAccording to data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the majority of members of the Japanese parliament are male and range in age from 50 to 70. In April 2023, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, Ryosuke Takashima, 26, is Japan's youngest-ever mayor.[123]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Administrative divisions of Japan and Prefectures of Japan\n\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature.[113] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:[124]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Prefectures of Japan with colored regions | **Hokkaido**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1. Hokkaido\n | **Tōhoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n2. Aomori\n3. Iwate\n4. Miyagi\n5. Akita\n6. Yamagata\n7. Fukushima\n | **Kantō**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n8. Ibaraki\n9. Tochigi\n10. Gunma\n11. Saitama\n12. Chiba\n13. Tokyo\n14. Kanagawa\n | **Chūbu**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15. Niigata\n16. Toyama\n17. Ishikawa\n18. Fukui\n19. Yamanashi\n20. Nagano\n21. Gifu\n22. Shizuoka\n23. Aichi\n |\n| **Kansai**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n24. Mie\n25. Shiga\n26. Kyoto\n27. Osaka\n28. Hyōgo\n29. Nara\n30. Wakayama\n | **Chūgoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n31. Tottori\n32. Shimane\n33. Okayama\n34. Hiroshima\n35. Yamaguchi\n | **Shikoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n36. Tokushima\n37. Kagawa\n38. Ehime\n39. Kōchi\n | **Kyūshū**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n40. Fukuoka\n41. Saga\n42. Nagasaki\n43. Kumamoto\n44. Ōita\n45. Miyazaki\n46. Kagoshima\n47. Okinawa\n |\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Japan\n\n![](image)Japan is a member of both the G7 and the G20.\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 nations seeking reform of the Security Council.[125] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit.[126] It is the world's fifth-largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.[127] In 2021, Japan had the fourth-largest diplomatic network in the world.[128]\n\n\nJapan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance.[129] The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan.[129] Japan is also a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (more commonly \"the Quad\"), a multilateral security dialogue reformed in 2017 aiming to limit Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region, along with the United States, Australia, and India, reflecting existing relations and patterns of cooperation.[130][131]\n\n\nJapan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[132] South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan.[133] Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.[134]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japan Self-Defense Forces\n\n![](image)JMSDF *Kongō* class destroyer\nJapan is the second-highest-ranked Asian country in the 2022 Global Peace Index, after Singapore.[135] It spent 1% of its total GDP on its defence budget in 2020,[136] and maintained the tenth-largest military budget in the world in 2022.[137] The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.[138] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.[139]\n\n\nThe Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines.[140] In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.[141] In December 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida further confirmed this trend, instructing the government to increase spending by 65% until 2027.[142] Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.[143][144]\n\n\n\n### Domestic law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in Japan and Crime in Japan\n\n![](image)The headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency.[145] As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission.[146] The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.[147] The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.[148]\n\n\nThe Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords, and other weaponry.[149][150] According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018[update], the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence, and robbery are very low in Japan.[151][152][153][154]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Japan and LGBT rights in Japan\n\nJapan has faced criticism for not allowing same-sex marriages, despite a majority of Japanese people supporting marriage equality.[155] It is considered to be the least developed out of the G7 nations in terms of LGBT equality.[156][157] Japan does not explicitly legally ban racial or religious discrimination.[158]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Japan\n\n![](image)Skyscrapers in Nakanoshima, Osaka; a major financial center in Japan\nJapan has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States, China and Germany; and the fourth-largest economy by PPP.[159] As of 2021[update], Japan's labor force is the world's eighth-largest, consisting of over 68.6 million workers.[81] As of 2022[update], Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.6%.[160] Its poverty rate is the second highest among the G7 nations,[161] and exceeds 15.7% of the population.[162] Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies,[163] with national debt estimated at 248% relative to GDP as of 2022[update].[164] The Japanese yen is the world's third-largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro.[165]\n\n\nJapan was the world's fifth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer in 2022.[166][167] Its exports amounted to 18.2% of its total GDP in 2021.[168] As of 2022[update], Japan's main export markets were China (23.9 percent, including Hong Kong) and the United States (18.5 percent).[169] Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors, and auto parts.[81] Japan's main import markets as of 2022[update] were China (21.1 percent), the United States (9.9 percent), and Australia (9.8 percent).[169] Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.[169]\n\n\nThe Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment.[170][171] Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the world's ten largest cooperatives, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative as of 2018[update].[172] It ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. Japan ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019.[173] It attracted 31.9 million international tourists in 2019,[174] and was ranked eleventh in the world in 2019 for inbound tourism.[175] The 2021 *Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report* ranked Japan first in the world out of 117 countries.[176] Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $46.1 billion.[175]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture and fishery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan\n\n![](image)A rice paddy in Aizu, Fukushima Prefecture\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the total country's GDP as of 2018[update].[115] Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.[177] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.[178] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018[update].[179] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected.[180] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.[181]\n\n\nJapan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade.[182] Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch,[81] prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.[183] Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.[184]\n\n\n\n### Industry and services[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Manufacturing in Japan, Trade and services in Japan, Electronics industry in Japan, and Automotive industry in Japan\n\n![](image)A hybrid car manufactured by Toyota. Japan is the third-largest maker of motor vehicles in the world.[185]\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the \"largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods\".[81] Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP.[81] The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world as of 2019[update].[186]\n\n\nJapan is the third-largest automobile producer in the world as of 2022[update] and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company by vehicle production.[185][187] Quantitatively, Japan was the world's largest exporter of cars in 2021,[188] though it was overtaken by China in early 2023.[189][190] The Japanese shipbuilding industry faces increasing competition from its East Asian neighbors, South Korea and China; as a 2020 government initiative identified this sector as a target for increasing exports.[191]\n\n\nJapan's service sector accounts for about 69.5% of its total economic output as of 2021[update].[192] Banking, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Toyota, Mitsubishi UFJ, -NTT, ÆON, Softbank, Hitachi, and Itochu listed as among the largest in the world.[193][194]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of science and technology in Japan, Science and technology in Japan, Video gaming in Japan, and List of Japanese inventions and discoveries\n\n![](image)The Japanese Experiment Module (Kibō) at the International Space Station\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranked 13th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[195] Relative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world,[196] with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017[update].[197] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,[198] and three Fields medalists.[199]\n\n\nJapan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 45% of the world's 2020 total;[200] down from 55% in 2017.[201] Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees.[202]\n\n\nOnce considered the strongest in the world, the Japanese consumer electronics industry is in a state of decline as regional competition arises in neighboring East Asian countries such as South Korea and China.[203] However, Japan's video game sector remains a major industry. In 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.[204] By 2015, Japan had become the world's fourth-largest PC game market, behind only China, the United States, and South Korea.[205]\n\n\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites.[206] It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibō) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.[207] The space probe *Akatsuki* was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015.[208] Japan's plans in space exploration include building a Moon base and landing astronauts by 2030.[209] In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the Moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007,[210][211] and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.[212]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Japan\n\n![](image)Japan Airlines, the flag carrier of Japan\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure.[213] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017[update].[214]\n\n\nSince privatization in 1987,[215] dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.[216]\n\n\nThere are 175 airports in Japan as of 2013[update].[81] The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second-busiest airport in 2019.[217] The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively as of 2017[update].[218]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Japan\n\n![](image)Part of the Seto Hill Windfarm\nAs of 2019[update], 37.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25.1% from coal, 22.4% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 2.8% from nuclear power, among other sources. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010.[219] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service.[220] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015,[221] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted.[222] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy.[223] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[224]\n\n\n\n### Water supply and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in Japan\n\nResponsibility for the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment, in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.[225] Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. About 98% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities.[226]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Japan, Japanese people, Ethnic groups of Japan, List of metropolitan areas in Japan, and List of cities in Japan\n\n![](image)View of Tokyo from the top of the Tokyo Skytree. The Greater Tokyo Area is ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\nJapan has a population of almost 125 million, of which nearly 122 million are Japanese nationals (2022 estimates).[227] A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder.[228] \nJapan is the world's fastest aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one-third of its total population;[229] this is the result of a post–World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates.[230] Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.4, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world's lowest;[231] it has a median age of 48.4, the highest in the world.[232] As of 2020[update], over 28.7 percent of the population is over 65, or more than one in four out of the Japanese population.[229] As a growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remaining childless,[233][234] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 88 million by 2065.[229]\n\n\nThe changes in demographic structure have created several social issues, particularly a decline in the workforce population and an increase in the cost of social security benefits.[233] The Government of Japan projects that there will be almost one elderly person for each person of working age by 2060.[232] Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.[235][236] On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.[237]\n\n\nIn 2019, 92% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.[238] The capital city, Tokyo, has a population of 13.9 million (2022).[239] It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).[240] Japan is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society,[241] with the Japanese people forming 98.1% of the country's population.[242] Minority ethnic groups in the country include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people.[243] Zainichi Koreans,[244] Chinese,[245] Filipinos,[246] Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[247] and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are also among Japan's small minority groups.[248] *Burakumin* make up a social minority group.[249]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in Japan2015 Census\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | Prefecture | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Prefecture | Pop. |\n| 1 | Tokyo | Tokyo | 9,272,740 | 11 | Hiroshima | Hiroshima | 1,194,034\n |\n| 2 | Yokohama | Kanagawa | 3,724,844 | 12 | Sendai | Miyagi | 1,082,159\n |\n| 3 | Osaka | Osaka | 2,691,185 | 13 | Chiba | Chiba | 971,882\n |\n| 4 | Nagoya | Aichi | 2,295,638 | 14 | Kitakyushu | Fukuoka | 961,286\n |\n| 5 | Sapporo | Hokkaido | 1,952,356 | 15 | Sakai | Osaka | 839,310\n |\n| 6 | Fukuoka | Fukuoka | 1,538,681 | 16 | Niigata | Niigata | 810,157\n |\n| 7 | Kobe | Hyōgo | 1,537,272 | 17 | Hamamatsu | Shizuoka | 797,980\n |\n| 8 | Kawasaki | Kanagawa | 1,475,213 | 18 | Kumamoto | Kumamoto | 740,822\n |\n| 9 | Kyoto | Kyoto | 1,475,183 | 19 | Sagamihara | Kanagawa | 720,780\n |\n| 10 | Saitama | Saitama | 1,263,979 | 20 | Okayama | Okayama | 719,474\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Japan\n\n![](image)The torii of Itsukushima Shinto Shrine near Hiroshima\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom.[250] Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion.[251] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual.[252] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.[253] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.[31]\n\n\nChristianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, 1%[254] to 1.5% of the population are Christians.[255] Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.[256]\n\n\nAbout 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants as of 2016[update].[257] As of 2018[update] there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were Japanese nationals.[258] Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Baháʼí Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.[259]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Japan\n\n![](image)*Kanji* and *hiragana* signs\nThe Japanese language is Japan's *de facto* national language and the primary written and spoken language of most people in the country.[260] Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radicals used by kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.[261] English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language. As a result, the prevalence of English in the educational system has increased, with English classes becoming mandatory at all levels of the Japanese school system by 2020.[260] Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support.[260]\n\n\nBesides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.[262] Few children learn these languages,[263] but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.[264] The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014[update].[265] Additionally, a number of other languages are taught and used by ethnic minorities, immigrant communities, and a growing number of foreign-language students, such as Korean (including a distinct Zainichi Korean dialect), Chinese and Portuguese.[260]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Japan\n\n![](image)Students celebrating after the announcement of the results of the entrance examinations to the University of Tokyo\nSince the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years.[266] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.[267] The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.[268] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.[269]\n\n\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world.[270] Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 520 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.[271][270][272] It spent roughly 3.1% of its total GDP on education as of 2018[update],[273] below the OECD average of 4.9%.[274] In 2021, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25 to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 55.6%.[275] Approximately 65% of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, and bachelor's degrees are held by 34.2% of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.[275] In 2020, the share of women among tertiary programmes graduates was 51,8%.[275]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Japan and Health care system in Japan\n\n![](image)Fujita University Hospital is the largest multi-speciality teaching hospital in Japan.\nHealth care in Japan is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments.[276] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.[277]\n\n\nJapan spent 10.74% of its total GDP on healthcare in 2019.[278] In 2020, the overall life expectancy in Japan at birth was 84.62 years (81.64 years for males and 87.74 years for females), the highest in the world;[279] while it had a very low infant mortality rate (2 per 1,000 live births).[280] Since 1981, the principal cause of death in Japan is cancer, which accounted for 27% of the total deaths in 2018—followed by cardiovascular diseases, which led to 15% of the deaths.[281] Japan has one of the world's highest suicide rates, which is considered a major social issue.[282] Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men.[283] However, Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia among developed countries.[284]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Japan\n\nSee also: Japanese popular culture\n\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America.[285] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[286] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.[106] Japan is considered a cultural superpower.[287][288]\n\n\n\n### Art and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese art\n\nFurther information: Japanese architecture, Japanese garden, Japanese esthetics, Japanese painting, and Japanese sculpture\n\n![](image)\nHokusai's 19th-century ukiyo-e woodblock print *The Great Wave off Kanagawa*\n![](image)\nRitsurin Garden, one of the most famous strolling gardens in Japan\n\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.[289] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[289]\n\n\nJapanese architecture is a combination of local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.[290] The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.[291] Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.[292] Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design.[293] It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzō Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.[294]\n\n\n\n### Literature and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Japanese literature, Japanese poetry, and Japanese philosophy\n\n![](image)12th-century illustrated handscroll of *The Tale of Genji*, a National Treasure\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the *Kojiki* and *Nihon Shoki* chronicles and the *Man'yōshū* poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.[295][296] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as *kana* (hiragana and katakana) was developed.[297] *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative.[298] An account of court life is given in *The Pillow Book* by Sei Shōnagon, while *The Tale of Genji* by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.[299][300]\n\n\nDuring the Edo period, the chōnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bashō revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinshū with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue *Oku no Hosomichi*.[301] The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Kafū Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors – Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburō Ōe (1994).[302]\n\n\nJapanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.[303] Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.[304]\n\n\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Japan and Theatre of Japan\n\n![](image)*Noh* performance at a Shinto shrine\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century.[305] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture.[306] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America.[307] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop.[308] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.[309]\n\n\nThe four traditional theaters from Japan are *noh*, *kyōgen*, *kabuki*, and *bunraku*.[310] Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.[311]\n\n\n\n### Holidays[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Public holidays in Japan and Japanese festivals\n\n![](image)Young ladies celebrate Coming of Age Day (成人の日, *Seijin no Hi*) in Harajuku, Tokyo.\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (国民の祝日に関する法律, *Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru Hōritsu*) of 1948.[312] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.[313] The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Shōwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.[314]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese cuisine\n\n![](image)A plate of *nigiri-zushi*\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.[315] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.[316] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.[317][318] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as *wagashi*.[319] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes include green tea ice cream.[320]\n\n\nPopular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14–17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.[321] Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century.[322] Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.[323]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cinema of Japan, Manga, Anime, and Media of Japan\n\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.[324] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally;[325] other popular shows are in the genres of variety shows, comedy, and news programs.[326] Many Japanese media franchises have gained considerable global popularity and are among the world's highest-grossing media franchises. Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016[update].[327]\n\n\nJapan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally.[328] Ishirō Honda's *Godzilla* became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of *kaiju* films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history.[329][330] Japanese comics, known as manga, developed in the mid-20th century and have become popular worldwide.[331][332] A large number of manga series have become some of the best-selling comics series of all time, rivalling the American comics industry.[333] Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have become highly popular internationally.[334][335]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Japan\n\n![](image)Sumo wrestlers form around the referee during the ring-entering ceremony.\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.[336] Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum.[337] Baseball is the most popular sport in the country.[338] Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), was established in 1936.[339] Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League (J.League) in 1992, association football gained a wide following.[340] The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.[341] Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times,[342] and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.[343] Golf is also popular in Japan.[344]\n\n\nIn motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, and the World Rally Championship.[345][346][347] Drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans as well as podium finishes in Formula One, in addition to success in domestic championships.[348][349] Super GT is the most popular national racing series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top-level domestic open-wheel series.[350] The country hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix.[351]\n\n\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.[352] The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship[353] and will co-host the 2023 Basketball World Championship.[354] Tokyo hosted the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.[355] The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation.[356] Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country[357] and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.[358]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* Index of Japan-related articles\n* Outline of Japan\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** [ɲippoꜜɴ] ⓘ or [ɲihoꜜɴ] ⓘ\n2. **^** In English, the official name of the country is simply \"Japan\".[11] In Japanese, the name of the country as it appears on official documents, including the country's constitution, is 日本国 (*Nippon-koku*ⓘ or *Nihon-koku*), meaning \"State of Japan\".

It is in the northwest Pacific Ocean and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 14,125 islands, with the five main islands being Hokkaido, Honshu (the \"mainland\"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.\n\n\nJapan has over 125 million inhabitants and is the 11th most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its highly urbanized population on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Japan has the world's highest life expectancy, though it is experiencing a population decline due to its very low birth rate.\n\n\nJapan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC). Between the fourth and ninth centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and the imperial court based in Heian-kyō. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (*shōgun*) and feudal lords (*daimyō*), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (*samurai*). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-modeled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. Amidst a rise in militarism and overseas colonization, Japan invaded China in 1937 and entered World War II as an Axis power in 1941. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution.\n\n\nUnder the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. Japan is a developed country and a great power, with one of the largest economies by nominal GDP. Japan has renounced its right to declare war, though it maintains a Self-Defense Force that ranks as one of the world's strongest militaries. A global leader in the automotive, robotics, and electronics industries, the country has made significant contributions to science and technology, and is one of the world's largest exporters and importers. It is part of multiple major international and intergovernmental institutions.\n\n\nJapan is considered a cultural superpower as the culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, film, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent manga, anime, and video game industries.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Japan\n\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji 日本 and is pronounced *Nippon* or *Nihon*.[12] Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as *Wa* (倭, changed in Japan around 757 to 和) and in Japan by the endonym *Yamato*.[13] *Nippon*, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on Japanese banknotes and postage stamps.[12] *Nihon* is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period.[13] The characters 日本 mean \"sun origin\",[12] which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".[14]\n\n\nThe name \"Japan\" is based on Chinese pronunciations of 日本 and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters 日本國 as *Cipangu*.[15] The old Malay name for Japan, *Japang* or *Japun*, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.[16] The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as *Giapan* in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Japan\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Japanese history.\n\n### Prehistoric to classical history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Legendary Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇, *Jinmu-tennō*)\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan.[19] This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.[20] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery.[21] From around 700 BC, the Japonic-speaking Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula,[22][23][24] intermingling with the Jōmon;[24] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming,[25] a new style of pottery,[26] and metallurgy from China and Korea.[27] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.[28]\n\n\nJapan first appears in written history in the Chinese *Book of Han*, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[29] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Shōtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).[30]\n\n\nIn 645, the government led by Prince Naka no Ōe and Fujiwara no Kamatari devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China.[31] It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[32] The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of China. Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn about Chinese writing, politics, art, and religion.[31] The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince Ōama and his nephew Prince Ōtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[33] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taihō Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments.[32] These legal reforms created the *ritsuryō* state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[33]\n\n\nThe Nara period (710–784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the *Kojiki* (712) and *Nihon Shoki* (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture.[34][35] A smallpox epidemic in 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[35][36] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyoto) in 794.[35] This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's *The Tale of Genji* and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem *\"Kimigayo\"* were written during this time.[37]\n\n\n\n### Feudal era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japanese samurai boarding a Mongol vessel during the Mongol invasions of Japan, depicted in the *Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba*, 1293\n![](image)Three unifiers of Japan. Left to right: Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai.[38] In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan by the Minamoto clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura.[39] After Yoritomo's death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the *shōgun*.[35] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class.[40] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo.[35] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336–1573).[41] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (*daimyō*) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").[42]\n\n\nDuring the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.[35][43] Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other *daimyō*;[44] his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi–Momoyama period.[45] After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.[35]\n\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support.[46] When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed *shōgun* by Emperor Go-Yōzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo).[47] The shogunate enacted measures including *buke shohatto*, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous *daimyō*,[48] and in 1639 the isolationist *sakoku* (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603–1868).[47][49] Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.[50] The study of Western sciences (*rangaku*) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki.[47] The Edo period gave rise to *kokugaku* (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.[51]\n\n\n\n### Modern era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nEmperor Meiji (明治天皇, *Meiji-tennō*); 1852–1912\n![](image)\nThe Japanese Empire in 1942\n\nThe United States Navy sent Commodore Matthew C. Perry to force the opening of Japan to the outside world. Arriving at Uraga with four \"Black Ships\" in July 1853, the Perry Expedition resulted in the March 1854 Convention of Kanagawa.[47] Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises.[47] The resignation of the *shōgun* led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration).[52] Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution (November 29, 1890), and assembled the Imperial Diet.[53] During the Meiji period (1868–1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.[54][55][56] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin.[57][53] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.[58][59]\n\n\nThe early 20th century saw a period of Taishō democracy (1912–1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization.[60][61] World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China.[61] The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups.[59][62][63] This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning several radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later.[64] In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Japan's imperial ambitions ended on September 2, 1945, with the country's surrender to the Allies.\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).[65] In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.[59][66] On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific.[67] Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery.[68] After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender.[69] The war cost Japan its colonies and millions of lives.[59] The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese Empire and its influence over the territories it conquered.[70][71] The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.[71]\n\n\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices.[71] The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952,[72] and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956.[71] A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world;[71] this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\".[73] In 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[74] On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the *Reiwa* era.[75]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Japan and Geology of Japan\n\n![](image)A topographic map of Japan\nJapan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia.[76] It stretches over 3000 km (1900 mi) northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.[77][78] The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa.[79] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.[80] As of 2019[update], Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi).[4] Japan has the sixth-longest coastline in the world at 29,751 km (18,486 mi). Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the eighth-largest exclusive economic zone in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).[81][82]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago is 67% forests and 14% agricultural.[83] The primarily rugged and mountainous terrain is restricted for habitation.[84] Thus the habitable zones, mainly in the coastal areas, have very high population densities: Japan is the 40th most densely populated country.[85][86] Honshu has the highest population density at 450 persons/km2 (1200/sq mi) as of 2010[update], while Hokkaido has the lowest density of 64.5 persons/km2 as of 2016[update].[87] As of 2014[update], approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (*umetatechi*).[88] Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and the country's largest freshwater lake.[89]\n\n\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic eruptions because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[90] It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index.[91] Japan has 111 active volcanoes.[92] Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century;[93] the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.[94] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.[74]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Japan § Climate\n\n![](image)Mount Fuji in Spring, view from Arakurayama Sengen Park\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.[95]\n\n\nIn the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn.[96] The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.[95]\n\n\nThe Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.[95] The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.[97] According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.[98] The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1 °C (106.0 °F), was recorded on July 23, 2018,[99] and repeated on August 17, 2020.[100]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Japan\n\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.[101] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019[update],[102] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.[103]\n\n\nA large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 52 Ramsar wetland sites.[104][105] Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.[106]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Japan and Climate change in Japan\n\n![](image)Autumn maple leaves (*momiji*) at Kongōbu-ji on Mount Kōya, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concerns, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970.[107] The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.[108]\n\n\nJapan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.[109] Japan is the world's fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide.[98] As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.[110] In 2020 the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050.[111] Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.[112]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Emperor of Japan, Government of Japan, Politics of Japan, and Law of Japan\n\n![](image)Emperor Naruhito, current head of state, and Empress Masako participated in the Imperial Procession by motorcar after the Ceremony of the Enthronement in Tokyo on November 10, 2019.\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role.[113] Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.[114] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)The National Diet Building\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament.[113] It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms.[115] There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age,[116] with a secret ballot for all elected offices.[114] The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet.[115] Fumio Kishida is Japan's prime minister; he took office after winning the 2021 Liberal Democratic Party leadership election.[117] The right-wing big tent Liberal Democratic Party has been the dominant party in the country since the 1950s, often called the 1955 System.[118]\n\n\nHistorically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as *Kujikata Osadamegaki*.[119] Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post–World War II modifications.[120] The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world.[121] Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[119] Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.[122]\n\n\nAccording to data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the majority of members of the Japanese parliament are male and range in age from 50 to 70. In April 2023, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, Ryosuke Takashima, 26, is Japan's youngest-ever mayor.[123]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Administrative divisions of Japan and Prefectures of Japan\n\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature.[113] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:[124]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Prefectures of Japan with colored regions | **Hokkaido**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1. Hokkaido\n | **Tōhoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n2. Aomori\n3. Iwate\n4. Miyagi\n5. Akita\n6. Yamagata\n7. Fukushima\n | **Kantō**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n8. Ibaraki\n9. Tochigi\n10. Gunma\n11. Saitama\n12. Chiba\n13. Tokyo\n14. Kanagawa\n | **Chūbu**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15. Niigata\n16. Toyama\n17. Ishikawa\n18. Fukui\n19. Yamanashi\n20. Nagano\n21. Gifu\n22. Shizuoka\n23. Aichi\n |\n| **Kansai**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n24. Mie\n25. Shiga\n26. Kyoto\n27. Osaka\n28. Hyōgo\n29. Nara\n30. Wakayama\n | **Chūgoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n31. Tottori\n32. Shimane\n33. Okayama\n34. Hiroshima\n35. Yamaguchi\n | **Shikoku**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n36. Tokushima\n37. Kagawa\n38. Ehime\n39. Kōchi\n | **Kyūshū**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n40. Fukuoka\n41. Saga\n42. Nagasaki\n43. Kumamoto\n44. Ōita\n45. Miyazaki\n46. Kagoshima\n47. Okinawa\n |\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Japan\n\n![](image)Japan is a member of both the G7 and the G20.\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 nations seeking reform of the Security Council.[125] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit.[126] It is the world's fifth-largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.[127] In 2021, Japan had the fourth-largest diplomatic network in the world.[128]\n\n\nJapan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance.[129] The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan.[129] Japan is also a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (more commonly \"the Quad\"), a multilateral security dialogue reformed in 2017 aiming to limit Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region, along with the United States, Australia, and India, reflecting existing relations and patterns of cooperation.[130][131]\n\n\nJapan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[132] South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan.[133] Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.[134]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japan Self-Defense Forces\n\n![](image)JMSDF *Kongō* class destroyer\nJapan is the second-highest-ranked Asian country in the 2022 Global Peace Index, after Singapore.[135] It spent 1% of its total GDP on its defence budget in 2020,[136] and maintained the tenth-largest military budget in the world in 2022.[137] The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.[138] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.[139]\n\n\nThe Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines.[140] In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.[141] In December 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida further confirmed this trend, instructing the government to increase spending by 65% until 2027.[142] Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.[143][144]\n\n\n\n### Domestic law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in Japan and Crime in Japan\n\n![](image)The headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency.[145] As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission.[146] The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.[147] The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.[148]\n\n\nThe Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords, and other weaponry.[149][150] According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018[update], the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence, and robbery are very low in Japan.[151][152][153][154]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Japan and LGBT rights in Japan\n\nJapan has faced criticism for not allowing same-sex marriages, despite a majority of Japanese people supporting marriage equality.[155] It is considered to be the least developed out of the G7 nations in terms of LGBT equality.[156][157] Japan does not explicitly legally ban racial or religious discrimination.[158]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Japan\n\n![](image)Skyscrapers in Nakanoshima, Osaka; a major financial center in Japan\nJapan has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States, China and Germany; and the fourth-largest economy by PPP.[159] As of 2021[update], Japan's labor force is the world's eighth-largest, consisting of over 68.6 million workers.[81] As of 2022[update], Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.6%.[160] Its poverty rate is the second highest among the G7 nations,[161] and exceeds 15.7% of the population.[162] Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies,[163] with national debt estimated at 248% relative to GDP as of 2022[update].[164] The Japanese yen is the world's third-largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro.[165]\n\n\nJapan was the world's fifth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer in 2022.[166][167] Its exports amounted to 18.2% of its total GDP in 2021.[168] As of 2022[update], Japan's main export markets were China (23.9 percent, including Hong Kong) and the United States (18.5 percent).[169] Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors, and auto parts.[81] Japan's main import markets as of 2022[update] were China (21.1 percent), the United States (9.9 percent), and Australia (9.8 percent).[169] Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.[169]\n\n\nThe Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment.[170][171] Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the world's ten largest cooperatives, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative as of 2018[update].[172] It ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. Japan ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019.[173] It attracted 31.9 million international tourists in 2019,[174] and was ranked eleventh in the world in 2019 for inbound tourism.[175] The 2021 *Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report* ranked Japan first in the world out of 117 countries.[176] Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $46.1 billion.[175]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture and fishery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan\n\n![](image)A rice paddy in Aizu, Fukushima Prefecture\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the total country's GDP as of 2018[update].[115] Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.[177] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.[178] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018[update].[179] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected.[180] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.[181]\n\n\nJapan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade.[182] Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch,[81] prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.[183] Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.[184]\n\n\n\n### Industry and services[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Manufacturing in Japan, Trade and services in Japan, Electronics industry in Japan, and Automotive industry in Japan\n\n![](image)A hybrid car manufactured by Toyota.

The country ranked 13th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[195] Relative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world,[196] with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017[update].[197] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,[198] and three Fields medalists.[199]\n\n\nJapan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 45% of the world's 2020 total;[200] down from 55% in 2017.[201] Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees.[202]\n\n\nOnce considered the strongest in the world, the Japanese consumer electronics industry is in a state of decline as regional competition arises in neighboring East Asian countries such as South Korea and China.[203] However, Japan's video game sector remains a major industry. In 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.[204] By 2015, Japan had become the world's fourth-largest PC game market, behind only China, the United States, and South Korea.[205]\n\n\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites.[206] It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibō) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.[207] The space probe *Akatsuki* was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015.[208] Japan's plans in space exploration include building a Moon base and landing astronauts by 2030.[209] In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the Moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007,[210][211] and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.[212]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Japan\n\n![](image)Japan Airlines, the flag carrier of Japan\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure.[213] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017[update].[214]\n\n\nSince privatization in 1987,[215] dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.[216]\n\n\nThere are 175 airports in Japan as of 2013[update].[81] The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second-busiest airport in 2019.[217] The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively as of 2017[update].[218]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Japan\n\n![](image)Part of the Seto Hill Windfarm\nAs of 2019[update], 37.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25.1% from coal, 22.4% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 2.8% from nuclear power, among other sources. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010.[219] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service.[220] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015,[221] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted.[222] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy.[223] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[224]\n\n\n\n### Water supply and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in Japan\n\nResponsibility for the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment, in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.[225] Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. About 98% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities.[226]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Japan, Japanese people, Ethnic groups of Japan, List of metropolitan areas in Japan, and List of cities in Japan\n\n![](image)View of Tokyo from the top of the Tokyo Skytree. The Greater Tokyo Area is ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\nJapan has a population of almost 125 million, of which nearly 122 million are Japanese nationals (2022 estimates).[227] A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder.[228] \nJapan is the world's fastest aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one-third of its total population;[229] this is the result of a post–World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates.[230] Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.4, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world's lowest;[231] it has a median age of 48.4, the highest in the world.[232] As of 2020[update], over 28.7 percent of the population is over 65, or more than one in four out of the Japanese population.[229] As a growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remaining childless,[233][234] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 88 million by 2065.[229]\n\n\nThe changes in demographic structure have created several social issues, particularly a decline in the workforce population and an increase in the cost of social security benefits.[233] The Government of Japan projects that there will be almost one elderly person for each person of working age by 2060.[232] Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.[235][236] On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.[237]\n\n\nIn 2019, 92% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.[238] The capital city, Tokyo, has a population of 13.9 million (2022).[239] It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).[240] Japan is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society,[241] with the Japanese people forming 98.1% of the country's population.[242] Minority ethnic groups in the country include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people.[243] Zainichi Koreans,[244] Chinese,[245] Filipinos,[246] Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[247] and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are also among Japan's small minority groups.[248] *Burakumin* make up a social minority group.[249]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in Japan2015 Census\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | Prefecture | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Prefecture | Pop. |\n| 1 | Tokyo | Tokyo | 9,272,740 | 11 | Hiroshima | Hiroshima | 1,194,034\n |\n| 2 | Yokohama | Kanagawa | 3,724,844 | 12 | Sendai | Miyagi | 1,082,159\n |\n| 3 | Osaka | Osaka | 2,691,185 | 13 | Chiba | Chiba | 971,882\n |\n| 4 | Nagoya | Aichi | 2,295,638 | 14 | Kitakyushu | Fukuoka | 961,286\n |\n| 5 | Sapporo | Hokkaido | 1,952,356 | 15 | Sakai | Osaka | 839,310\n |\n| 6 | Fukuoka | Fukuoka | 1,538,681 | 16 | Niigata | Niigata | 810,157\n |\n| 7 | Kobe | Hyōgo | 1,537,272 | 17 | Hamamatsu | Shizuoka | 797,980\n |\n| 8 | Kawasaki | Kanagawa | 1,475,213 | 18 | Kumamoto | Kumamoto | 740,822\n |\n| 9 | Kyoto | Kyoto | 1,475,183 | 19 | Sagamihara | Kanagawa | 720,780\n |\n| 10 | Saitama | Saitama | 1,263,979 | 20 | Okayama | Okayama | 719,474\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Japan\n\n![](image)The torii of Itsukushima Shinto Shrine near Hiroshima\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom.[250] Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion.[251] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual.[252] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.[253] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.[31]\n\n\nChristianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, 1%[254] to 1.5% of the population are Christians.[255] Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.[256]\n\n\nAbout 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants as of 2016[update].[257] As of 2018[update] there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were Japanese nationals.[258] Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Baháʼí Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.[259]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Japan\n\n![](image)*Kanji* and *hiragana* signs\nThe Japanese language is Japan's *de facto* national language and the primary written and spoken language of most people in the country.[260] Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radicals used by kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.[261] English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language. As a result, the prevalence of English in the educational system has increased, with English classes becoming mandatory at all levels of the Japanese school system by 2020.[260] Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support.[260]\n\n\nBesides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.[262] Few children learn these languages,[263] but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.[264] The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014[update].[265] Additionally, a number of other languages are taught and used by ethnic minorities, immigrant communities, and a growing number of foreign-language students, such as Korean (including a distinct Zainichi Korean dialect), Chinese and Portuguese.[260]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Japan\n\n![](image)Students celebrating after the announcement of the results of the entrance examinations to the University of Tokyo\nSince the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years.[266] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.[267] The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.[268] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.[269]\n\n\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world.[270] Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 520 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.[271][270][272] It spent roughly 3.1% of its total GDP on education as of 2018[update],[273] below the OECD average of 4.9%.[274] In 2021, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25 to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 55.6%.[275] Approximately 65% of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, and bachelor's degrees are held by 34.2% of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.[275] In 2020, the share of women among tertiary programmes graduates was 51,8%.[275]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Japan and Health care system in Japan\n\n![](image)Fujita University Hospital is the largest multi-speciality teaching hospital in Japan.\nHealth care in Japan is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments.[276] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.[277]\n\n\nJapan spent 10.74% of its total GDP on healthcare in 2019.[278] In 2020, the overall life expectancy in Japan at birth was 84.62 years (81.64 years for males and 87.74 years for females), the highest in the world;[279] while it had a very low infant mortality rate (2 per 1,000 live births).[280] Since 1981, the principal cause of death in Japan is cancer, which accounted for 27% of the total deaths in 2018—followed by cardiovascular diseases, which led to 15% of the deaths.[281] Japan has one of the world's highest suicide rates, which is considered a major social issue.[282] Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men.[283] However, Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia among developed countries.[284]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Japan\n\nSee also: Japanese popular culture\n\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America.[285] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[286] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.[106] Japan is considered a cultural superpower.[287][288]\n\n\n\n### Art and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese art\n\nFurther information: Japanese architecture, Japanese garden, Japanese esthetics, Japanese painting, and Japanese sculpture\n\n![](image)\nHokusai's 19th-century ukiyo-e woodblock print *The Great Wave off Kanagawa*\n![](image)\nRitsurin Garden, one of the most famous strolling gardens in Japan\n\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.[289] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[289]\n\n\nJapanese architecture is a combination of local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.[290] The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.[291] Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.[292] Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design.[293] It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzō Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.[294]\n\n\n\n### Literature and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Japanese literature, Japanese poetry, and Japanese philosophy\n\n![](image)12th-century illustrated handscroll of *The Tale of Genji*, a National Treasure\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the *Kojiki* and *Nihon Shoki* chronicles and the *Man'yōshū* poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.[295][296] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as *kana* (hiragana and katakana) was developed.[297] *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative.[298] An account of court life is given in *The Pillow Book* by Sei Shōnagon, while *The Tale of Genji* by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.[299][300]\n\n\nDuring the Edo period, the chōnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bashō revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinshū with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue *Oku no Hosomichi*.[301] The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Kafū Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors – Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburō Ōe (1994).[302]\n\n\nJapanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.[303] Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.[304]\n\n\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Japan and Theatre of Japan\n\n![](image)*Noh* performance at a Shinto shrine\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century.[305] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture.[306] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America.[307] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop.[308] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.[309]\n\n\nThe four traditional theaters from Japan are *noh*, *kyōgen*, *kabuki*, and *bunraku*.[310] Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.[311]\n\n\n\n### Holidays[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Public holidays in Japan and Japanese festivals\n\n![](image)Young ladies celebrate Coming of Age Day (成人の日, *Seijin no Hi*) in Harajuku, Tokyo.\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (国民の祝日に関する法律, *Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru Hōritsu*) of 1948.[312] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.[313] The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Shōwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.[314]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese cuisine\n\n![](image)A plate of *nigiri-zushi*\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.[315] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.[316] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.[317][318] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as *wagashi*.[319] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes include green tea ice cream.[320]\n\n\nPopular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14–17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.[321] Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century.[322] Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.[323]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cinema of Japan, Manga, Anime, and Media of Japan\n\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.[324] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally;[325] other popular shows are in the genres of variety shows, comedy, and news programs.[326] Many Japanese media franchises have gained considerable global popularity and are among the world's highest-grossing media franchises. Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016[update].[327]\n\n\nJapan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally.[328] Ishirō Honda's *Godzilla* became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of *kaiju* films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history.[329][330] Japanese comics, known as manga, developed in the mid-20th century and have become popular worldwide.[331][332] A large number of manga series have become some of the best-selling comics series of all time, rivalling the American comics industry.[333] Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have become highly popular internationally.[334][335]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Japan\n\n![](image)Sumo wrestlers form around the referee during the ring-entering ceremony.\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.[336] Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum.[337] Baseball is the most popular sport in the country.[338] Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), was established in 1936.[339] Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League (J.League) in 1992, association football gained a wide following.[340] The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.[341] Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times,[342] and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.[343] Golf is also popular in Japan.[344]\n\n\nIn motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, and the World Rally Championship.[345][346][347] Drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans as well as podium finishes in Formula One, in addition to success in domestic championships.[348][349] Super GT is the most popular national racing series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top-level domestic open-wheel series.[350] The country hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix.[351]\n\n\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.[352] The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship[353] and will co-host the 2023 Basketball World Championship.[354] Tokyo hosted the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.[355] The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation.[356] Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country[357] and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.[358]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* Index of Japan-related articles\n* Outline of Japan\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** [ɲippoꜜɴ] ⓘ or [ɲihoꜜɴ] ⓘ\n2. **^** In English, the official name of the country is simply \"Japan\".[11] In Japanese, the name of the country as it appears on official documents, including the country's constitution, is 日本国 (*Nippon-koku*ⓘ or *Nihon-koku*), meaning \"State of Japan\".

The total area of the United Kingdom is 93,628 square miles (242,495 km2), with an estimated 2022 population of nearly 67 million people.\n\n\nThe United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. The Treaty of Union between the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707 resulted in their unification to become the Kingdom of Great Britain. Its union in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted its name in 1927.[m] The nearby Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey are not part of the UK, being Crown Dependencies, but the British government is responsible for their defence and international representation.[18]\n\n\nThe UK became the first industrialised country and was the world's foremost power for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly during the \"Pax Britannica\" between 1815 and 1914.[19][20] The British Empire, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and population, and was the largest empire in history; however, its involvement in the First World War and the Second World War damaged Britain's economic power and a global wave of decolonisation led to the independence of most British colonies.[21][22][23] British influence can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of its former colonies, and the UK's culture remains globally influential, particularly in literature, music and sport.\n\n\nThe United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy.[n][25] The capital and largest city of the United Kingdom (as well as the capital of England) is London. The cities of Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast are respectively the national capitals of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Other major cities include Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, and Leeds.[26] The UK consists of three distinct legal jurisdictions: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. This is due to these areas retaining their existing legal systems even after joining the UK.[27] Since 1998, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also have their own devolved governments and legislatures, each with varying powers.[28]\n\n\nThe UK has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal gross domestic product (GDP), and the ninth-largest by purchasing power parity. It is a recognised nuclear state and is ranked fourth globally in military expenditure.[29][30] The UK has been a permanent member of the UN Security Council since its first session in 1946. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the OECD, NATO, the Five Eyes, AUKUS and the CPTPP.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and terminology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Britain (place name) and Terminology of the British Isles\n\nIn 43 AD, *Britannia* referred to the Roman province that encompassed modern England and Wales. Great Britain encompassed the whole island, taking in the land north of the River Forth known to the Romans as Caledonia in modern Scotland (i.e. \"greater\" Britain).[31] In the Middle Ages, the name \"Britain\" was also applied to a small part of France now known as Brittany. As a result, Great Britain (likely from the French \"*Grande Bretagne*\") came into use to refer specifically to the island, with Brittany often referred to as \"Little Britain\".[32] However, that name had no official significance until 1707, when the island's kingdoms of England and Scotland were united as the Kingdom of Great Britain.[33]\n\n\nThe Acts of Union 1707 declared that the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland were \"United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain\".[o][34] The term \"United Kingdom\" has occasionally been used as a description for the former Kingdom of Great Britain, although its official name from 1707 to 1800 was simply \"Great Britain\".[35] The Acts of Union 1800 united the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the partition of Ireland and the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922, which left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland within the United Kingdom, the name was changed in 1927 to the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\".[36]\n\n\nAlthough the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also widely referred to as countries.[37] The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase \"countries within a country\" to describe the United Kingdom.[16] Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve NUTS 1 regions refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as \"regions\".[38] Northern Ireland is also referred to as a \"province\".[39] With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used \"can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences\".[40]\n\n\nThe term \"Great Britain\" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination.[41] It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole.[42] The word *England* is occasionally used incorrectly to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole, a mistake principally made by people from outside the UK.[43]\n\n\nThe term \"Britain\" is used as a synonym for Great Britain,[44][45] and the United Kingdom.[46][45] Usage is mixed: the UK Government prefers to use the term \"UK\" rather than \"Britain\" or \"British\" on its website (except when referring to embassies),[47] while acknowledging that both terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere \"British government\" is used at least as frequently as \"United Kingdom government\".[48] The UK Permanent Committee on Geographical Names recognises \"United Kingdom\", \"UK\" and \"U.K.\" as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list \"Britain\" but notes that \"it is only the one specific nominal term 'Great Britain' which invariably excludes Northern Ireland\".[48] The BBC historically preferred to use \"Britain\" as shorthand only for Great Britain, though the present style guide does not take a position except that \"Great Britain\" excludes Northern Ireland.[49]\n\n\nThe adjective \"British\" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and matters to do with nationality.[50] People of the United Kingdom use several different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being British, English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish, or Irish;[51] or as having a combination of different national identities.[52] The official designation for a citizen of the United Kingdom is \"British citizen\".[48]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and History of the British Isles\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of British history.\n\n### Prior to the Treaty of Union[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of England, History of Wales, History of Scotland, and History of Ireland\n\n![](image)Stonehenge in Wiltshire is a ring of stones, each about 4 m (13 ft) high, 2 m (7 ft) wide and 25 tonnes, erected 2400–2200 BC.\nSettlement by Cro-Magnons of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago.[53] By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland.[54]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of the Baths showing a rectangular area of greenish water surrounded by yellow stone buildings with pillars. In the background is the tower of the abbey.](image)The Roman Baths in Bath, Somerset, are a well-preserved *thermae* from Roman Britain.\nThe Roman conquest, beginning in 43 AD, and the 400-year rule of southern Britain, was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly to what was to become Wales, Cornwall and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Hen Ogledd (northern England and parts of southern Scotland).[55] Most of the region settled by the Anglo-Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century.[56] Meanwhile, Gaelic-speakers in north-west Britain (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century)[57] united with the Picts to create the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings, 1066, and the events leading to it.\nIn 1066, the Normans invaded England from northern France. After conquering England, they seized large parts of Wales, conquered much of Ireland and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern French model and Norman-French culture.[59] The Anglo-Norman ruling class greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, the local cultures.[60] Subsequent medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and tried unsuccessfully to annex Scotland. Asserting its independence in the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath, Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in near-constant conflict with England.\n\n\nThe English monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the Hundred Years' War, while the Kings of Scots were in an alliance with the French during this period.[61]\nEarly modern Britain saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country.[62] The English Reformation ushered in political, constitutional, social and cultural change in the 16th century and established the Church of England. Moreover, it defined a national identity for England and slowly, but profoundly, changed people's religious beliefs.[63] Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England,[64] and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown.[65] In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland.[66]\n\n\nIn 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI, King of Scots, inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal, and religious institutions.[67]\n\n\nIn the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the execution of King Charles I, and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.[68]\n\n\nAlthough the monarchy was restored, the Interregnum along with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the subsequent Bill of Rights 1689 in England and Claim of Right Act 1689 in Scotland ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system.[69] With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America and the Caribbean.[70]\n\n\nThough previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the Treaty of Union of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.\n\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Great Britain[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Treaty of Union and Kingdom of Great Britain\n\n![](image)The Treaty of Union led to a united kingdom of all of Great Britain.\nOn 1 May 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the Acts of Union 1707.[71]\n\n\nIn the 18th century, cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole, in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of Jacobite uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs. The British colonies in North America that broke away in the American War of Independence became the United States, recognised by Britain in 1783. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to India.[72]\n\n\nBritain played a leading part in the Atlantic slave trade, mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British-colonial slave ships transported nearly 3.3 million slaves from Africa.[73] The slaves were taken to work on plantations, principally in the Caribbean but also North America.[74] Slavery coupled with the Caribbean sugar industry had a significant role in strengthening the British economy in the 18th century.[75] However, with pressure from the abolitionism movement, Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the blockade of Africa and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties.[76]\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United Kingdom, Acts of Union (1800), and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\n\nIn 1801 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)The opening engagement at the Battle of Trafalgar, by J.W. Carmichael\nAfter the defeat of France at the end of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830).[78] Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as *Pax Britannica* (\"British Peace\"), a period of relative peace among the Great Powers (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman.[79] By the time of the Great Exhibition of 1851, Britain was described as the \"workshop of the world\".[80] From 1853 to 1856, Britain took part in the Crimean War, allied with the Ottoman Empire against Tsarist Russia,[81] participating in the naval battles of the Baltic Sea known as the Åland War in the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland, among others.[82] Following the Indian Rebellion in 1857, the British government led by Lord Palmerston assumed direct rule over India. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of regions such as East Asia and Latin America.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Victoria reigned as Queen of the United Kingdom and Empress of India during the 19th century.Throughout the Victorian era, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies, as well as a gradual widening of the voting franchise, with the 1884 Reform Act championed by William Gladstone granting suffrage to a majority of males for the first time. The British population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses.[84] By the late 19th century, the Conservatives under Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury initiated a period of imperial expansion in Africa, maintained a policy of splendid isolation in Europe, and attempted to contain Russian influence in Afghanistan and Persia, in what came to be known as the Great Game.[85] During this time, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were granted self-governing dominion status.[86] At the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the German Empire and the United States.[87] The Edwardian era saw social reform and home rule for Ireland become important domestic issues, while the Labour Party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900, and suffragettes campaigned for women's right to vote.[88]\n\n\n### World wars and partition of Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United Kingdom during the First World War, Partition of Ireland, Interwar Britain, United Kingdom home front during the Second World War, and Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II\n\n![](image)Wreaths being laid during the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London\nBritain was one of the principal Allies that defeated the Central Powers in the First World War (1914–1918). Alongside their French, Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts,[89] British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the Western Front.[90] The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt.[90] The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections with the Representation of the People Act 1918.[90] After the war, Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the League of Nations and received a mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies. Under the leadership of David Lloyd George, the British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.[91]\n\n\nBy the mid-1920s, most of the British population could listen to BBC radio programmes.[92][93] Experimental television broadcasts began in 1929 and the first scheduled BBC Television Service commenced in 1936.[94] The rise of Irish nationalism, and disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish Home Rule, led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921.[95] The Irish Free State became independent, initially with Dominion status in 1922, and unambiguously independent in 1931. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.[96] The 1928 Equal Franchise Act gave women electoral equality with men in national elections. Strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the General Strike of 1926, which ended in a victory for the government led by Stanley Baldwin. Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War when the Great Depression (1929–1932) led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. A coalition government was formed in 1931.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Spitfire and Hurricane as flown in the Battle of Britain during the Second World War\nNonetheless, \"Britain was a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system.\"[98] After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Britain entered the Second World War. Winston Churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year, Britain and its Empire continued the war against Germany. Churchill engaged industry, scientists and engineers to support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort.[98]\n\n\nIn 1940, the Royal Air Force defeated the German Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz. The Grand Alliance of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union formed in 1941, leading the Allies against the Axis powers. There were eventual hard-fought victories in the Battle of the Atlantic, the North Africa campaign and the Italian campaign. British forces played important roles in the Normandy landings of 1944 and the liberation of Europe. The British Army led the Burma campaign against Japan, and the British Pacific Fleet fought Japan at sea. British scientists contributed to the Manhattan Project whose task was to build an atomic weapon.[99] Once built, it was decided, with British consent, to use the weapon against Japan.[100]\n\n\n\n### Postwar 20th century[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Postwar Britain (1945–1979) and Social history of Postwar Britain (1945–1979)\n\n![](image)The British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921\nThe UK was one of the Big Three powers (along with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the post-war world;[101] it was an original signatory to the Declaration by United Nations and became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. It worked closely with the United States to establish the IMF, World Bank and NATO.[102] The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the Marshall Plan,[103] but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe.[104]\n\n\nIn the immediate post-war years, the Labour government under Clement Attlee initiated a radical programme of reforms, which significantly impacted British society in the following decades.[105] Major industries and public utilities were nationalised, a welfare state was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the National Health Service, was created.[106] The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's much-diminished economic position, so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable. Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947.[107] Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence, and many became members of the Commonwealth of Nations.[108]\n\n\n\n![](image)Concorde was a supersonic airliner that reduced transatlantic flight time from 8 hours to 3.5 hours.[109]\nThe UK was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal (with its first atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane, in 1952), but the post-war limits of Britain's international role were illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956. The international spread of the English language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture.[110][111] As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government encouraged immigration from Commonwealth countries. In the following decades, the UK became a more multi-ethnic society.[112] Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France, West Germany and Japan.\n\n\nIn the decades-long process of European integration, the UK was a founding member of the Western European Union, established with the London and Paris Conferences in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the European Communities (EC). In a 1975 referendum 67% voted to stay in it.[113] When the EC became the European Union (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states.\n\n\nFrom the late 1960s, Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK) conventionally known as the Troubles. It is usually considered to have ended with the 1998 Belfast \"Good Friday\" Agreement.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Canary Wharf, a symbol of the financial reforms initiated by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s\nFollowing a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the Conservative government of the 1980s led by Margaret Thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism, deregulation, particularly of the financial sector (for example, the Big Bang in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.[115]\n\n\nIn 1982, Argentina invaded the British territories of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, leading to the 10-week Falklands War in which Argentine forces were defeated. The inhabitants of the islands are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty, expressed in a 2013 referendum. From 1984, the UK economy was helped by the inflow of substantial North Sea oil revenues.[116]\n\n\nAround the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[117] The statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the European Convention on Human Rights. The UK remained a Great Power with global diplomatic and military influence and a leading role in the United Nations and NATO.[118]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Political history of the United Kingdom (1979–present) and Social history of the United Kingdom (1979–present)\n\n![](image)Pro-Brexit campaigners outside Parliament in London in November 2016, after the Brexit referendum\nThe UK broadly supported the United States' approach to the \"war on terror\" in the early 21st century.[119] British troops fought in the War in Afghanistan, but controversy surrounded Britain's military deployment in Iraq, which saw the largest protest in British history demonstrating in opposition to the government led by Tony Blair.[120]\n\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis severely affected the UK economy.[121] The Cameron–Clegg coalition government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits.[122] Studies have suggested that policy led to significant social disruption and suffering.[123][124] A referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 resulted in the Scottish electorate voting by 55.3 to 44.7% to remain part of the United Kingdom.[125]\n\n\nIn 2016, 51.9 per cent of voters in the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.[126] The UK left the EU in 2020.[127] On 1 May 2021 the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement came into force.[128]\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the UK's economy, caused major disruptions to education and had far-reaching impacts on society and politics in 2020 and 2021.[129][130][131] The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to use an approved COVID-19 vaccine, developing its own vaccine through a collaboration between Oxford University and AstraZeneca, which allowed the UK's vaccine rollout to be among the fastest in the world.[132][133]\n\n\nOn 8 September 2022, Elizabeth II, the longest-living and longest-reigning British monarch, died at the age of 96.[134] Upon the Queen's death, her eldest child Charles, Prince of Wales, acceded to the British throne as Charles III.[135]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of the United Kingdom, Fauna of Great Britain, and Flora of Great Britain and Ireland\n\n![](image)Satellite image of the United Kingdom (excluding Shetland)\nThe total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 244,820 square kilometres (94,530 sq mi). The country occupies the major part of the British Isles[136] archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel.[137]\n\n\nThe Royal Greenwich Observatory in London was chosen as the defining point of the Prime Meridian[138] at the International Meridian Conference in 1884.[139]\n\n\nThe United Kingdom lies between latitudes 49° and 61° N, and longitudes 9° W and 2° E. Northern Ireland shares a 224-mile (360 km) land boundary with the Republic of Ireland.[137] The coastline of Great Britain is 11,073 miles (17,820 km) long.[140] It is connected to continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel, which at 31 miles (50 km) (24 miles (38 km) underwater) is the longest underwater tunnel in the world.[141]\n\n\nThe UK contains four terrestrial ecoregions: Celtic broadleaf forests, English Lowlands beech forests, North Atlantic moist mixed forests, and Caledon conifer forests.[142] The area of woodland in the UK in 2023 is estimated to be 3.25 million hectares, which represents 13% of the total land area in the UK.[143]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate of the United Kingdom and Climate change in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Köppen climate types of the UK\nMost of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round.[137] The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0 °C (32 °F) or rising above 30 °C (86 °F).[144] Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate (*Cfc*). Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate (*Dfc*) and the mountains experience a tundra climate (*ET*).[145]\n\n\nThe prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean,[137] although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind. Since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions, the eastern parts are the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters, especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.[146]\n\n\nThe average total annual sunshine in the United Kingdom is 1339.7 hours, which is just under 30% of the maximum possible.[147] The hours of sunshine vary from 1200 to about 1580 hours per year, and since 1996 the UK has been and still is receiving above the 1981 to 2010 average hours of sunshine.[148]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the United Kingdom is ranked 2nd out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[149] A law has been passed that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050.[150]\n\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nEngland accounts for 53 per cent of the UK, covering 50,350 square miles (130,395 km2).[151] Most of the country consists of lowland terrain,[152] with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees–Exe line which roughly divides the UK into lowland and upland areas. Lowland areas include Cornwall, the New Forest, the South Downs and the Norfolk Broads. Upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, and Dartmoor. The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames, Severn, and the Humber. England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike, at 978 metres (3,209 ft) in the Lake District; its largest island is the Isle of Wight.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Skiddaw massif, Keswick and Derwent Water in the Lake District\n![](image)\nSkye is one of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides and part of the Scottish Highlands.\n\nScotland accounts for 32 per cent of the UK, covering 30,410 square miles (78,772 km2).[153] This includes nearly 800 islands,[154] notably the Hebrides, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands. Scotland is the most mountainous constituent country of the UK, the Highlands to the north and west are the more rugged region containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous land, including the Cairngorms, Loch Lomond and The Trossachs and Ben Nevis which at 1,345 metres (4,413 ft)[155] is the highest point in the British Isles.[156]\n\n\nWales accounts for less than 9 per cent of the UK, covering 8,020 square miles (20,779 km2).[157] Wales is mostly mountainous, though South Wales is less mountainous than North and mid Wales. The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon (Welsh: *Yr Wyddfa*) which, at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft), is the highest peak in Wales.[152] Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,704 kilometres) of coastline including the Pembrokeshire Coast.[140] Several islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is Anglesey (*Ynys Môn*).\n\n\nNorthern Ireland, separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and North Channel, has an area of 5,470 square miles (14,160 km2) and is mostly hilly. It includes Lough Neagh which, at 150 square miles (388 km2), is the largest lake in the British Isles by area,[158] Lough Erne which has over 150 islands and the Giant's Causeway which is a World Heritage Site. The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at 852 metres (2,795 ft).[152]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of the United Kingdom, Government of the United Kingdom, and Monarchy of the United Kingdom\n\n![King Charles III](image)\nCharles III, Monarch since 2022\n![Rishi Sunak](image)\nRishi Sunak, Prime Minister since 2022\n\nThe UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy operating under the Westminster system, otherwise known as a \"democratic parliamentary monarchy\".[159] It is a centralised, unitary state[160][161] wherein the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign.[162] Parliament is made up of the elected House of Commons, the appointed House of Lords and the Crown (as personified by the monarch).[p][165] The main business of parliament takes place in the two houses,[165] but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of parliament (that is, statute law).[166] As a result of parliamentary sovereignty, the British constitution is uncodified, consisting mostly of disparate written sources, including parliamentary statutes, judge-made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions.[167] Nevertheless, the Supreme Court recognises a number of principles underlying the British constitution, such as parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy, and upholding international law.[168]\n\n\nKing Charles III is the current monarch and head of state of the UK and of 14 other independent countries. These 15 countries are today referred to as \"Commonwealth realms\". The monarch is formally vested with all executive authority as the personal embodiment of the Crown and is \"...fundamental to the law and working of government in the UK.\"[169] The disposition of such powers however, including those belonging to the royal prerogative, is generally exercised only on the advice of ministers of the Crown responsible to Parliament and thence to the electorate. Nevertheless, in the performance of official duties, the monarch has \"the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn\".[170] In addition, the monarch has a number of reserve powers at his disposal, albeit rarely used, to uphold responsible government and prevent constitutional crises.[q]\n\n\n\n![Large sand-coloured building of Gothic design beside brown river and road bridge. The building has several large towers, including large clock tower.](image)The Palace of Westminster in London is the seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nFor general elections (elections to the House of Commons), the UK is currently divided into 650 constituencies, each of which is represented by one member of Parliament (MP) elected by the first-past-the-post system.[172] MPs hold office for up to five years and must then stand for re-election if they wish to continue to be an MP.[172] The Conservative Party, colloquially known as the Tory Party or the Tories, and the Labour Party have been the dominant political parties in the UK since the 1920s, leading to the UK being described as a two-party system. However, since the 1920s other political parties have won seats in the House of Commons, although never more than the Conservatives or Labour.[173]\n\n\nThe prime minister is the head of government in the UK.[174] Acting under the direction and supervision of a Cabinet of senior ministers selected and led by the prime minister, the Government serves as the principal instrument for public policymaking, administers public services and, through the Privy Council, promulgates statutory instruments and tenders advice to the monarch.[175][176][177]\nNearly all prime ministers have served concurrently as First Lord of the Treasury[178] and all prime ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since 1905,[179] Minister for the Civil Service since 1968,[180] and Minister for the Union since 2019.[181] While appointed by the monarch, in modern times the prime minister is, by convention, an MP, the leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons, and holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons.[182][183][184] The current Prime Minister, as of October 2022, is Rishi Sunak MP, leader of the Conservative Party.\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Countries of the United Kingdom, Administrative geography of the United Kingdom, and List of counties in the United Kingdom\n\nThe geographical division of the United Kingdom into counties or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages, and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early Modern Period.[185] Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and Wales in 1888, Scotland in 1889 and Ireland in 1898, meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the UK.[186]\nUntil the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.[187]\n\n\nLocal government in England is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine regions, now used primarily for statistical purposes.[188] One of the regions, Greater London, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a 1998 referendum.[189]\n\n\nLocal government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. The cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas, as is the Highland Council, which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000 people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.[190]\n\n\nLocal government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself. These include the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, which are unitary authorities in their own right.[191] Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system.[191]\n\n\nLocal government in Northern Ireland since 1973, has been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as waste collection, dog control, and maintaining parks and cemeteries.[192] In 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system.[193]\n\n\n\n### Devolved governments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Devolution in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)\n![England](image) England\n\n![Scotland](image) Scotland\n\n![Wales](image) Wales\n\nNorthern  \nIreland\nThe four countries of the United Kingdom\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Population | Total area\n | Capital | Parliament | First Minister\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) England | 56,489,800 (2021) | 130,279 km2 (50,301 sq mi)\n | London | none\n | none\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | 5,436,600 (2022) | 77,933 km2 (30,090.1 sq mi)\n | Edinburgh | Scottish Parliament | Humza Yousaf |\n| ![](image) Wales | 3,267,501 (2022) | 20,779 km2 (8,022.82 sq mi)\n | Cardiff | Senedd | Mark Drakeford |\n| Northern Ireland | 1,903,100 (2021) | 14,130 km2 (5,455.62 sq mi)\n | Belfast | Northern Ireland Assembly | vacant\n |\n\n\n#### Scotland[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Scottish Parliament, Scottish Government, and Local government in Scotland\n\nSince 1999, Scotland has had a devolved national government and legislature called the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government and Parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK Parliament, including education, healthcare, Scots law and local government.[194] Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an act of the UK parliament passed in 2020.[202] The current Scottish Government is a Scottish National Party and Scottish Greens coalition, led by First Minister Humza Yousaf, leader of the Scottish National Party. In 2014, the Scottish independence referendum was held, with 55.3% voting against independence from the United Kingdom and 44.7% voting in favour, resulting in Scotland staying within the United Kingdom. Local government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.[190]\n\n\n\n#### Wales[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Senedd, Welsh Government, and Local government in Wales\n\nSince 1999, Wales has a devolved national government and legislature, known as the Senedd. Elections to the Senedd use the additional member system. They have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.[203] The Senedd is able to legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament through Acts of Senedd Cymru. The current Welsh Government is Labour, led by First Minister Mark Drakeford, who has been the First Minister since 2018. Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself.\n\n\n\n#### Northern Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Northern Ireland Assembly, Northern Ireland Executive, Local government in Northern Ireland, and The Troubles\n\nSince 1998, Northern Ireland has a devolved government, the Executive, and legislature, the Assembly. Elections to the Assembly use the single transferable vote system. The Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly.[204] The Island of Ireland has a turbulent and violent modern political history, a period referred to as the Troubles. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement acts as a *de facto* constitution for Northern Ireland. Local government in Northern Ireland since 2015 has been divided between 11 councils with limited responsibilities.[192]\n\n\n\n#### Constitutional arrangement[edit]\n\n\nThe UK does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly.[205] In practice, it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd, because these institutions were created by referendum decisions.[206] The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater still, because devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the Government of Ireland.[207] The UK Parliament restricts the three devolved parliaments' legislative competence in economic areas through an act passed in 2020.[202]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of the United Kingdom and Foreign policy of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak greets US President Joe Biden at the 2022 G-20 Bali Summit.\nThe UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of NATO, AUKUS, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.[208] The UK has the British Council which is a British organisation based in over 100 countries specialising in international cultural and educational opportunities. The UK is said to have a \"Special Relationship\" with the United States and a close partnership with France – the \"Entente cordiale\" – and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries;[209][210] the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world. The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a Common Travel Area and co-operate through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council. Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and military engagements.[211] Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are former colonies of the British Empire which share King Charles as their head of state, are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by British people.[212]\n\n\n\n### Dependencies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British Overseas Territories, Crown Dependencies, British Islands, and List of leaders of British dependencies\n\nThe United Kingdom, the 14 British Overseas Territories[213] and the three Crown Dependencies[214] form 'one undivided Realm'.[215][216] All parts of the realm are under the sovereignty of the British Crown, but the Territories and Dependencies are not part of the UK. This is distinct from the status of Commonwealth realms, who have separate monarchies, but share the same monarch.[216]\n\n\nTemplate:UK territories image map\n\n\nThe 14 British Overseas Territories are remnants of the British Empire: Anguilla; Bermuda; the British Antarctic Territory; the British Indian Ocean Territory; the British Virgin Islands; the Cayman Islands; the Falkland Islands; Gibraltar; Montserrat; Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha; the Turks and Caicos Islands; the Pitcairn Islands; South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; and Akrotiri and Dhekelia on the island of Cyprus.[217] British claims in Antarctica have limited international recognition.[218] Collectively Britain's overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of 480,000 square nautical miles (640,000 sq mi; 1,600,000 km2),[219] with a total population of approximately 250,000.[220] The overseas territories also give the UK the world's fifth largest exclusive economic zone at 6,805,586 km2 (2,627,651 sq mi).[221]\n\n\nThe Crown Dependencies are possessions of the Crown, as opposed to territories of the UK.[222] They comprise three independently administered jurisdictions: the Bailiwicks of Jersey and of Guernsey in the English Channel, and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. By mutual agreement, the British Government manages the islands' foreign affairs and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf. Internationally, they are regarded as \"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\".[223] The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown (Privy Council or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor).[224] Since 2005, each Crown dependency has had a Chief Minister as its head of government.[225]\n\n\n\n### Law and criminal justice[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law of the United Kingdom, Censorship in the United Kingdom, and Crime in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and civil cases in Scotland.\nThe United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as Article 19 of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system.[226] Today the UK has three distinct systems of law: English law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law. A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.[227] The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies.[228]\n\n\nBoth English law, which applies in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland law are based on common-law principles.[229] The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases).[230] Scots law is a hybrid system based on common-law and civil-law principles. The chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases,[231] and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases.[232] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.[233]\n\n\nCrime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66 per cent in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015,[234] according to crime statistics. The prison population of England and Wales has increased to 86,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 148 per 100,000.[235]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage has been legal in England, Scotland, and Wales since 2014, and in Northern Ireland since 2020.[236] LGBT equality in the United Kingdom is considered advanced by modern standards.[237][238]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British Armed Forces and Military history of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)\nHMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales\n![](image)\nRoyal Navy Destroyer HMS Defender\n![](image)\nRoyal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon Jet\n![](image)\nBritish Army Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank\n\n*His Majesty's Armed Forces* consist of three professional service branches: the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (forming the Naval Service), the British Army and the Royal Air Force.[239] The armed forces of the United Kingdom are managed by the Ministry of Defence and controlled by the Defence Council, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence. The Commander-in-Chief is the British monarch, to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance.[240] The Armed Forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in NATO, including the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, the Five Power Defence Arrangements, RIMPAC and other worldwide coalition operations. Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in Ascension Island, Bahrain, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Oman, Qatar and Singapore.[241]\n\n\nAccording to sources which include the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the UK has either the fourth- or the fifth-highest military expenditure. Total defence spending amounts to 2.0 per cent of national GDP.[242] Following the end of the Cold War, defence policy has a stated assumption that \"the most demanding operations\" will be undertaken as part of a coalition.[243]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)London is the largest urban economy in Europe[244] and, alongside New York, the city in the world most integrated with the global economy.[245]\nThe UK has a partially regulated market economy.[246] Based on market exchange rates, the UK is the sixth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe by nominal GDP.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based.\nThe United Kingdom uses the pound sterling, currently the fourth most-traded currency in the foreign exchange market and the world's fourth-largest reserve currency (after the United States dollar, euro, and yen).[247] The pound sterling was the best performing currency in the first quarter of 2023, gaining 2.5pc against the dollar, ahead of all other G10 economies.[248] London is the world capital for foreign exchange trading, with a global market share of 38.1% in 2022[249] of the daily $7.5 trillion global turnover.[250] HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and is responsible for issuing notes and coins in the pound sterling. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue.\n\n\nThe service sector made up around 80% of the UK's GVA in 2021.[251] As of 2022, the UK is the world's second-largest exporter of services.[252] London is one of the world's largest financial centres, ranking second in the world in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2022. London also has the largest city GDP in Europe.[253] Edinburgh ranks 17th in the world, and sixth in Western Europe in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2020.[254] Tourism is very important to the British economy; London was named as Europe's most popular destination for 2022.[255][256] The creative industries accounted for 5.9% of the UK's GVA in 2019, having grown by 43.6% in real terms from 2010.[257] Creative industries contributed more than £111bn to the UK economy in 2018, growth in the sector is more than five times larger than growth across the UK economy as a whole as reported in 2018.[258] Lloyd's of London is the world's largest insurance and reinsurance market and is located in London.[259] WPP plc, the world's biggest advertising company, is also based in the UK.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aston Martin manufacture vehicles in Gaydon, England.\nThe automotive industry employs around 800,000 people, with a turnover in 2022 of £67 billion, generating £27 billion of exports (10% of the UK's total export of goods). In 2022, the UK produced around 775,000 passenger vehicles and 101,600 commercial vehicles, including luxury cars such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Range Rover. The UK is a major centre for engine manufacturing: in 2022 around 1.5 million engines were produced.[260] It is also the world's fourth-largest exporter of engines, as of 2021.[261] The UK motorsport industry employs more than 40,000 people, comprises around 4,300 companies and has an annual turnover of around £10 billion.[262] 7 of the 10 Formula One teams are based in the UK, with their technology being used in supercars and hypercars from McLaren, Aston Martin and Lotus.\n\n\nThe aerospace industry of the UK is the second largest national aerospace industry in the world depending upon the method of measurement and has an annual turnover of around £30 billion.[263] The UK space industry was worth £17.5bn in 2020/21 and employed 48,800 people. Since 2012, the number of space organisations has grown on average nearly 21% per year, with 1,293 organisations reported in 2021.[264][265] The UK Space Agency has stated in 2023 that it is investing £1.6 billion in space related projects.[266]\n\n\nThe agriculture industry is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing about 60 per cent of food needs with less than 1.6 per cent of the labour force (535,000 workers).[267] Around two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one-third to arable crops. The UK retains a significant, though much reduced fishing industry. It is also rich in a variety of natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, silica and an abundance of arable land.[268]\n\n\nThe United Kingdom has among the highest levels of income inequality in Europe[269] and the OECD,[270] and is one of the most regionally unequal high-income countries in the world.[271][272]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Science and technology in the United Kingdom and Telecommunications in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Cambridge is the most intensive research cluster for science and technology in the world.[273]\nEngland and Scotland were leading centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century.[274] The United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances.[275] Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science;[276] from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory; and more recently Stephen Hawking, who advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes.[277]\n\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) is responsible for helping to encourage, develop and manage the UK's scientific, research, and technological outputs. Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry.[278] In 2022 the UK retained its number one spot for technology in Europe reaching a combined market value of $1 trillion. Cambridge was named the number one university in the world for producing successful technology founders.[279]\n\n\nThe UK was ranked fourth in the Global Innovation Index 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, which is based on around 80 indicators, including measures of the political environment, education, infrastructure and knowledge creation.[280][273] During 2022, the UK produced 6.3 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had a 10.5 per cent share of scientific citations, the third highest in the world (for both). The UK ranked 1st in the world for Field-Weighted Citation Impact.[281] Scientific journals produced in the UK include publications by the *Royal Society*, *Nature*, the *British Medical Journal* and *The Lancet*.[282]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)A high-speed East Coast Main Line train in Northumberland\nA radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads.[137] The M25, encircling London, is the largest and busiest bypass in the world.[283] In 2022, there were a total of 40.8 million licensed vehicles in Great Britain.[284]\n\n\nThe UK has an extensive railway network of 10,072 miles (16,209 km). In Great Britain, the British Rail network was privatised between 1994 and 1997, followed by a rapid rise in passenger numbers. The UK was ranked eighth among national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index assessing intensity of use, quality of service and safety.[285] High Speed 2 (HS2) is a new high speed railway under construction linking up London, the Midlands, the North and Scotland, serving over 25 stations, including eight of Britain's 10 largest cities and connecting around 30 million people, capable of speeds of up to 225 mph.[286][287] Crossrail, which was renamed the Elizabeth line in 2016, in honour of Queen Elizabeth II, opened in 2022. It was Europe's largest construction project at the time and will bring in an estimated £42 billion to the UK economy.[288][289]\n\n\n\n![](image)London has the busiest city airport system in the world.\nGreat British Railways is a planned state-owned public body that will oversee rail transport in Great Britain. In 2014, there were 5.2 billion bus journeys in the UK, 2.4 billion of which were in London.[290] The red double-decker bus has entered popular culture as an internationally recognised icon of England.[291] The London bus network is extensive, with over 6,800 scheduled services every weekday carrying about six million passengers on over 700 different routes making it one of the most extensive bus systems in the world and the largest in Europe.[292]\n\n\nIn the year from October 2009 to September 2010, UK airports handled a total of 211.4 million passengers.[293] In that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport (65.6 million passengers), Gatwick Airport (31.5 million passengers) and London Stansted Airport (18.9 million passengers).[293] London Heathrow Airport, located 15 miles (24 km) west of the capital, is the world's second busiest airport by international passenger traffic and has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world;[294] it is the hub for the UK flag carrier British Airways, as well as Virgin Atlantic.[295]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Wind turbines overlooking Ardrossan in Scotland. The UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is its fastest-growing supply.\nIn 2021, the UK was the world's 14th-largest consumer of energy and the 22nd-largest producer.[296] The UK is home to many large energy companies, including two of the six major oil and gas companies – BP and Shell.[297]\n\n\nThe total of all renewable electricity sources provided 43% of the electricity generated in the UK in 2020.[298] The UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is the country's fastest-growing supply; in 2022, 26.8% of the UK's total electricity was generated by wind power.[299] The UK has the largest offshore wind farm in the world, which is located off the coast of Yorkshire.[300]\n\n\nIn 2023, the UK had 9 nuclear reactors normally generating about 15 per cent of the UK's electricity.[301] Unlike Germany and Japan, there are two reactors under construction and more planned.[302][303] In the late 1990s, nuclear power plants contributed around 25 per cent of the total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down. The UK government is investing in Small Modular Reactors and Advanced Modular Reactors research and development.\n\n\nIn 2021, the UK produced 935 thousand barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil (and other liquids) and consumed 1,258 thousand bbl/d.[296] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005.[304] In 2020[update], the UK had around 2 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves.[304]\n\n\nIn 2021, the UK was the 21st-largest producer of natural gas in the world.[305] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004.[305] In 2020, the UK produced 1.8 million tonnes of coal falling 91% in 10 years.[301] In 2020 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 26 million tonnes.[301] The UK Coal Authority has stated that there is a potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification (UCG) or 'fracking',[306] and based on current UK coal consumption, such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years.[307]\n\n\n\n### Water supply and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom\n\nAccess to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal. It is estimated that 96 per cent of households are connected to the sewer network.[308] According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007.[309]\n\n\nIn England and Wales water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private \"water only\" companies. In Scotland, water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company, Scottish Water. In Northern Ireland water and sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity, Northern Ireland Water.[310]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demography of the United Kingdom, British people, and Ceremonial counties of England\n\nIn the 2011 census the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775.[311] It is the fourth-largest in Europe (after Russia, Germany and France), the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world. In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth. In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth.[312] Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 per cent.[311] The 2011 census also showed that, over the previous 100 years, the proportion of the population aged 0–14 fell from 31 per cent to 18 per cent, and the proportion of people aged 65 and over rose from 5 to 16 per cent.[311] In 2018 the median age of the UK population was 41.7 years.[313]\n\n\nEngland's population in 2011 was 53 million, representing some 84 per cent of the UK total.[314] It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 420 people per square kilometre in mid-2015,[312] with a particular concentration in London and the south-east.[315] The 2011 census put Scotland's population at 5.3 million,[316] Wales at 3.06 million and Northern Ireland at 1.81 million.[314]\n\n\nIn 2017 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across the UK was 1.74 children born per woman.[317] While a rising birth rate is contributing to population growth, it remains considerably below the baby boom peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964,[318] or the high of 6.02 children born per woman in 1815,[319] below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63.[320] In 2011, 47.3 per cent of births in the UK were to unmarried women.[321] The Office for National Statistics reported in 2015 that out of the UK population aged 16 and over, 1.7 per cent identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (2.0 per cent of males and 1.5 per cent of females); 4.5 per cent of respondents responded with \"other\", \"I don't know\", or did not respond.[322] The number of transgender people in the UK was estimated to be between 65,000 and 300,000 by research between 2001 and 2008.[323]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom(England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area;[324] Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement;[325] Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area)[326]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Urban area |  Pop. | Principal settlement | Rank | Urban area |  Pop. | Principal settlement |\n| 1 | **Greater London** | 9,787,426 | London | 11 | **Bristol** | 617,280 | Bristol |\n| 2 | **Greater Manchester** | 2,553,379 | Manchester | 12 | **Edinburgh** | 512,150 | Edinburgh |\n| 3 | **West Midlands** | 2,440,986 | Birmingham | 13 | **Leicester** | 508,916 | Leicester |\n| 4 | **West Yorkshire** | 1,777,934 | Leeds | 14 | **Belfast** | 483,418 | Belfast |\n| 5 | **Greater Glasgow** | 985,290 | Glasgow | 15 |  **Brighton & Hove** | 474,485 | Brighton |\n| 6 | **Liverpool** | 864,122 | Liverpool | 16 |  **South East Dorset** | 466,266 | Bournemouth |\n| 7 | **South Hampshire** | 855,569 | Southampton | 17 |  **Cardiff** | 390,214 | Cardiff |\n| 8 | **Tyneside** | 774,891 | Newcastle upon Tyne | 18 | **Teesside** | 376,633 | Middlesbrough |\n| 9 | **Nottingham** | 729,977 | Nottingham | 19 | **Stoke-on-Trent** | 372,775 | Stoke-on-Trent |\n| 10 | **Sheffield** | 685,368 | Sheffield | 20 |  **Coventry** | 359,262 | Coventry |\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom\n\nHistorically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 12th century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans. Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK.[327] The UK has a history of non-white immigration with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade. During this period it is estimated the Afro-Caribbean population of Great Britain was 10,000 to 15,000[328] which later declined due to the abolition of slavery.[329] The UK also has the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century.[330] In 2011[update], 87.2 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 12.8 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of an ethnic minority group.[331]\n\n\nEthnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. 30.4 per cent of London's population and 37.4 per cent of Leicester's was estimated to be non-white in 2005[update],[332] whereas less than 5 per cent of the populations of North East England, Wales and the South West were from ethnic minorities, according to the 2001 census.[333] In 2016[update], 31.4 per cent of primary and 27.9 per cent of secondary pupils at state schools in England were members of an ethnic minority.[334]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the United Kingdom\n\nThe English language is the official and most spoken language of the United Kingdom that originated from England.[335][336] The United Kingdom proactively promotes the language globally to build connections, understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries worldwide.[337][338] It is estimated that 95 per cent of the UK's population are monolingual English speakers.[339] 5.5 per cent of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent immigration.[339] South Asian languages are the largest grouping which includes Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali, Sylheti, Hindi and Gujarati.[340] According to the 2011 census, Polish has become the second-largest language spoken in England and has 546,000 speakers.[341] In 2019, some three-quarters of a million people spoke little or no English.[342]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bilingual sign (Irish and English) in Newry, Northern Ireland\nThree indigenous Celtic languages are spoken in the UK: Welsh, Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Cornish, which became extinct as a first language in the late 18th century, is subject to revival efforts and has a small group of second language speakers.[343][2] According to the 2021 census, the Welsh-speaking population of Wales aged three or older was 538,300 people (17.8 per cent).[344] In addition, it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England.[345] In the 2011 census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people (10.4 per cent) stated that they had \"some knowledge of Irish\" (see Irish language in Northern Ireland), almost exclusively in the nationalist (mainly Catholic) population. Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2 per cent of the population) had some Gaelic language ability, including 72 per cent of those living in the Outer Hebrides.[346] The number of children being taught either Welsh or Scottish Gaelic is increasing.[347] Scots, a language descended from early northern Middle English, has limited recognition alongside its regional variant, Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland, without specific commitments to protection and promotion.[2][348] As of April 2020, there are said to be around 151,000 users of British Sign Language (BSL), a sign language used by deaf people, in the UK.[349]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in the United Kingdom\n\nReligion in the United Kingdom (2018 research)[350]\n\n\n\nNone (52%)\nChurch of England (13.7%)\nCatholic Church (8.7%)\nOther Christian (13.2%)\nIslam (6.7%)\nOther religions (3.6%)\nNot stated (2.1%)\n\nForms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for more than 1,400 years.[351] Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in many surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century,[352] while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths, most notably Islam.[353] This has led some commentators to variously describe the UK as a multi-faith,[354] secularised,[355] or post-Christian society.[356]\n\n\nIn the 2001 census, 71.6 per cent of all respondents indicated that they were Christians, with the next largest faiths being Islam (2.8 per cent), Hinduism (1.0 per cent), Sikhism (0.6 per cent), Judaism (0.5 per cent), Buddhism (0.3 per cent) and all other religions (0.3 per cent).[357] Of the respondents, 15 per cent stated that they had no religion and a further 7 per cent did not state a religious preference.[358] A Tearfund survey in 2007 showed that only one in ten Britons actually attend church weekly.[359] Between the 2001 and 2011 census, there was a 12 per cent decrease in the number of people who identified as Christian, while the percentage of those reporting no religious affiliation doubled. This contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories, with the number of Muslims increasing by the most substantial margin to a total of about 5 per cent.[360] The Muslim population has increased from 1.6 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2011, making it the second-largest religious group in the UK.[361]\n\n\nThe Church of England is the established church in England.[362] It retains a representation in the UK Parliament, and the British monarch is its Supreme Governor.[363] In Scotland, the Church of Scotland is recognised as the national church. It is not subject to state control, and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to \"maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government\" upon his or her accession.[364][2][365] The Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and, because the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of Ireland, there is no established church in Northern Ireland.[366] Although there are no UK-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, it has been estimated that 62 per cent of Christians are Anglican, 13.5 per cent Catholic, 6 per cent Presbyterian, and 3.4 per cent Methodist, with small numbers of other Protestant denominations such as Plymouth Brethren, and Orthodox churches.[367]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Historical immigration to Great Britain and Modern immigration to the United Kingdom\n\nSee also: Foreign-born population of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Estimated foreign-born population by country of birth from April 2007 to March 2008\n![](image)Estimated number of British citizens living overseas by country in 2006\nImmigration is now contributing to a rising UK population,[368] with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. According to official statistics released in 2015, 27 per cent of UK live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK.[369] The ONS reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 per cent to 239,000.[370]\n\n\nIn 2013, approximately 208,000 foreign nationals were naturalised as British citizens, the highest number since 1962. This figure fell to around 125,800 in 2014. Between 2009 and 2013, the average number of British citizenships granted annually was 195,800. The most common previous nationalities of those naturalised in 2014 were Indian, Pakistani, Filipino, Nigerian, Bangladeshi, Nepali, Chinese, South African, Polish and Somali.[371] The total number of grants of settlement, which confer permanent residence in the UK but not citizenship,[372] was approximately 154,700 in 2013, higher than the previous two years.[371]\n\n\nEmigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century. Between 1815 and 1930, around 11.4 million people emigrated from Britain and 7.3 million from Ireland. Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century, some 300 million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled around the globe.[373] Today, at least 5.5 million UK-born people live abroad,[374][375] mainly in Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada.[374][376]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United Kingdom and Universities in the United Kingdom\n\nFurther information: Education in England, Education in Scotland, Education in Wales, and Education in Northern Ireland\n\n![](image)University of Oxford is widely regarded as one of the world's leading universities.\nEducation in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system. About 38 per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree, which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world.[377] The United Kingdom is home to many universities, including the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge which often achieve first place on global rankings.[378][379]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 13th in the world in reading, literacy, mathematics, and science. The average British student scored 503.7, well above the OECD average of 493.[380]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in the United Kingdom\nFurther information: Healthcare in England, Healthcare in Scotland, and Healthcare in Wales\n![](image)NHS Scotland's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, the largest hospital campus in Europe\nThe modern-system of universal publicly funded in the United Kingdom has its origins in the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1949 which still exists to this day and is the primary healthcare provider in the United Kingdom. The widespread popularity of the NHS has led to it being described as a \"national religion\".[381][382] Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each country has its own system of universal publicly funded healthcare, although private healthcare is also available. Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The World Health Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.[383]\n\n\nSince 1979, expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly.[384] The 2018 OECD data, which incorporates in health a chunk of what in the UK is classified as social care, has the UK spending £3,121 per head.[385] In 2017 the UK spent £2,989 per person on healthcare, around the median for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.[386]\n\n\nRegulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges. Political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national executives; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Government. Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts.[387]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of the United Kingdom\n\nThe culture of the United Kingdom is influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history; and being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. As a result of the British Empire, British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies, in particular, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland, a common culture known today as the Anglosphere.[388][389] The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led to it being described as a \"cultural superpower\".[110][111] A global opinion poll for the BBC saw the United Kingdom ranked the third most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany and Canada) in 2013 and 2014.[390]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British literature\n\n![](image)William Shakespeare's First Folio from 1623; a copy is on display in the British Library.\nBritish literature includes literature associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Most British literature is in English. In 2005, some 206,000 books were published in the United Kingdom and in 2006 it was the largest publisher of books in the world.[391]\n\n\nThe English playwright and poet William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time.[392] The 20th-century English crime writer Agatha Christie is the best-selling novelist of all time.[393] Twelve of the top 25 of 100 novels by British writers chosen by a BBC poll of global critics were written by women; these included works by George Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Mary Shelley, Jane Austen, Doris Lessing and Zadie Smith.[394]\n\n\nScotland's contributions include Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes), Sir Walter Scott, J. M. Barrie, Robert Louis Stevenson and the poet Robert Burns. More recently Hugh MacDiarmid and Neil M. Gunn contributed to the Scottish Renaissance, with grimmer works from Ian Rankin and Iain Banks. Scotland's capital, Edinburgh, was UNESCO's first worldwide City of Literature.[395]\n\n\nWelsh literature includes Britain's oldest known poem, *Y Gododdin*, which was composed most likely in the late 6th century. It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the earliest known reference to King Arthur.[396] The Arthurian legend was further developed by Geoffrey of Monmouth.[397] Poet Dafydd ap Gwilym (*fl.* 1320–1370) is regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age.[398] Daniel Owen is credited as the first Welsh-language novelist, publishing *Rhys Lewis* in 1885. The best-known of the Anglo-Welsh poets are Dylan Thomas and R. S. Thomas, the latter nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996. Leading Welsh novelists of the twentieth century include Richard Llewellyn and Kate Roberts.[399][400]\n\n\nIrish writers, living at a time when all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, include Oscar Wilde,[401] Bram Stoker[402] and George Bernard Shaw.[403] There have been many authors whose origins were from outside the United Kingdom but who moved to the UK, including Joseph Conrad,[404] T. S. Eliot,[405] Kazuo Ishiguro,[406] Sir Salman Rushdie[407] and Ezra Pound.[408]\n\n\n\n### Philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British philosophy\n\nThe United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of 'British Empiricism', a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the 'Scottish School of Common Sense'.[409] The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke, George Berkeley[r] and David Hume; while Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major exponents of the Scottish \"common sense\" school. Two Britons are also notable for the ethical theory of utilitarianism, a moral philosophy first used by Jeremy Bentham and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work *Utilitarianism*.[410]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)The Proms is a classical music festival held at the Royal Albert Hall which regularly plays music by Edward Elgar and Henry Wood.\nVarious styles of music have become popular in the UK, including the indigenous folk music of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Historically, there has been exceptional Renaissance music from the Tudor period, with masses, madrigals and lute music by Thomas Tallis, John Taverner, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons and John Dowland. After the Stuart Restoration, an English tradition of dramatic masques, anthems and airs became established, led by Henry Purcell, followed by Thomas Arne and others. The German-born composer George Frideric Handel became a naturalised British citizen in 1727, when he composed the anthem *Zadok the Priest* for the coronation of George II; it became the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs. Handel's many oratorios, such as his famous *Messiah*, were written in the English language.[411] In the second half of the 19th century, as Arthur Sullivan and his librettist W. S. Gilbert wrote their popular Savoy operas, Edward Elgar's wide range of music rivalled that of his contemporaries on the continent. Increasingly, however, composers became inspired by the English countryside and its folk music, notably Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Benjamin Britten, a pioneer of modern British opera. Among the many post-war composers, some of the most notable have made their own personal choice of musical identity: Peter Maxwell Davies (Orkney), Harrison Birtwistle (mythological), and John Tavener (religious).[412]\n\n\nAccording to *The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians*, the term \"pop music\" originated in Britain in the mid-1950s to describe rock and roll's fusion with the \"new youth music\".[413] *The Oxford Dictionary of Music* states that artists such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones drove pop music to the forefront of popular music in the early 1960s.[414] Birmingham became known as the birthplace of heavy metal, with the band Black Sabbath starting there in the 1960s.[415] In the following years, Britain widely occupied a part in the development of rock music, with British acts pioneering hard rock;[416] raga rock; heavy metal;[417] space rock; glam rock;[418] Gothic rock,[419] psychedelic rock,[420] and punk rock.[421] British acts also developed neo soul and created dubstep.[422] The modern UK is known to produce some of the most prominent English-speaking rappers along with the United States, including Stormzy, Kano, Yxng Bane, Ramz, Little Simz and Skepta.[423]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Beatles are the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in popular music, selling over a billion records.[424][425][426]\nThe Beatles have international sales of over 1 billion units and are the biggest-selling and most influential band in the history of popular music.[424][425][426][427] Other prominent British contributors to have influenced popular music over the last 50 years include the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zeppelin, the Bee Gees, and Elton John, all of whom have worldwide record sales of 200 million or more.[428] The Brit Awards are the BPI's annual music awards, and some of the British recipients of the Outstanding Contribution to Music award include the Who, David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, the Police, and Fleetwood Mac (who are a British-American band).[429] More recent UK music acts that have had international success include George Michael, Oasis, Spice Girls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, Robbie Williams, Amy Winehouse, Susan Boyle, Adele, Ed Sheeran, Lewis Capaldi, One Direction and Harry Styles.[430]\n\n\nA number of UK cities are known for their music. Acts from Liverpool have had 54 UK chart number 1 hit singles, more per capita than any other city worldwide.[431] Glasgow's contribution to music was recognised in 2008 when it was named a UNESCO City of Music.[432] Manchester played a role in the spread of dance music such as acid house, and from the mid-1990s, Britpop. London and Bristol are closely associated with the origins of electronic music sub-genres such as drum and bass and trip hop.[433] Influential UK dance acts include the Prodigy, Underworld, Leftfield, Basement Jaxx, Chemical Brothers, Sub Focus, Chase & Status and Calvin Harris.\n\n\n\n### Visual art[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Art of the United Kingdom and Architecture of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)William Morris textile design, 1883\n![](image)The Angel of the North sculpture by Antony Gormley has become a symbol of northern England.\nMajor British artists include: the Romantics William Blake, John Constable, Samuel Palmer and J. M. W. Turner; the portrait painters Sir Joshua Reynolds and Lucian Freud; the landscape artists Thomas Gainsborough and L. S. Lowry; the pioneer of the Arts and Crafts Movement William Morris; the figurative painter Francis Bacon; the Pop artists Peter Blake, Richard Hamilton and David Hockney; the pioneers of Conceptual art movement Art & Language;[434] the collaborative duo Gilbert and George; the abstract artist Howard Hodgkin; and the sculptors Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Henry Moore. During the late 1980s and 1990s the Saatchi Gallery in London helped to bring to public attention a group of multi-genre artists who would become known as the \"Young British Artists\": Damien Hirst, Chris Ofili, Rachel Whiteread, Tracey Emin, Mark Wallinger, Steve McQueen, Sam Taylor-Wood and the Chapman Brothers are among the better-known members of this loosely affiliated movement.\n\n\nThe Royal Academy in London is a key organisation for the promotion of the visual arts in the United Kingdom. Major schools of art in the UK include: the six-school University of the Arts London, which includes the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and Chelsea College of Art and Design; Goldsmiths, University of London; the Slade School of Fine Art (part of University College London); the Glasgow School of Art; the Royal College of Art; and The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art (part of the University of Oxford). The Courtauld Institute of Art is a leading centre for the teaching of the history of art. Important art galleries in the United Kingdom include the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain and Tate Modern (the most-visited modern art gallery in the world, with around 4.7 million visitors per year).[435]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cinema of the United Kingdom and Theatre of the United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema. The British directors Alfred Hitchcock, whose film *Vertigo* is considered by some critics as the best film of all time,[436] and David Lean are among the most critically acclaimed of all time.[437] Many British actors have achieved international fame and critical success. Some of the most commercially successful films of all time have been produced in the United Kingdom, including two of the highest-grossing film franchises (*Harry Potter* and *James Bond*).[438]\n\n\nIn 2009, British films grossed around $2 billion worldwide and achieved a market share of around 7 per cent globally and 17 per cent in the United Kingdom.[439] UK box-office takings totalled £944 million in 2009, with around 173 million admissions.[439] The annual British Academy Film Awards are hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[440]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British cuisine\n\nFurther information: English cuisine, Northern Irish cuisine, Scottish cuisine, and Welsh cuisine\n\n![](image)Fish and chips, a traditional British dish served with lemon, tartar sauce and mushy peas\nBritish cuisine developed from various influences reflective of its land, settlements, arrivals of new settlers and immigrants, trade and colonialism. The British Empire facilitated a knowledge of Indian cuisine with its \"strong, penetrating spices and herbs\". British cuisine has absorbed the cultural influence of those who have settled in Britain, producing hybrid dishes, such as chicken tikka masala.[441] The British have embraced world cuisine and regularly eat recipes or fast food from Europe, the Caribbean and Asia. Afternoon tea is a light afternoon meal served with tea in tea rooms and hotels around the United Kingdom, with the tradition dating back to around 1840.[442]\n\n\nA 2019 YouGov poll rated classic British food, the following had more than 80% of people like them who had tried them: Sunday roast, Yorkshire pudding, Fish and chips, Crumpets, and Full English breakfast.[443] Sweet foods are common within British cuisine, and there is a long list of British desserts.\n\n\nVegan and vegetarian diets have increased in Britain in recent years. In 2021, a survey found that 8% of British respondents eat a plant-based diet and 36% of respondents have a favourable view of plant-based diets.[444]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester is one of the largest media production facilities in Europe.\nThe BBC, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world.[445][446][447] It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television licence.[448] The BBC World Service is an international broadcaster owned and operated by the BBC. It is the world's largest of any kind.[449] It broadcasts radio news, speech and discussions in more than 40 languages.[450]\n\n\nOther major players in the UK media include ITV, which operates 11 of the 15 regional television broadcasters that make up the ITV Network,[451] and Sky.[452] Newspapers produced in the United Kingdom include the *Daily Mail*, *The Guardian*, *The Telegraph*, *The Times*, and the *Financial Times*.[453] Magazines and journals published in the United Kingdom that have achieved worldwide circulation include *The Spectator*, *The Economist*, *New Statesman*, and *Radio Times.*\n\n\nLondon dominates the media sector in the UK: national newspapers and television and radio are largely based there, although MediaCityUK in Manchester is also a significant national media centre. Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Cardiff, are important centres of newspaper and broadcasting production in Scotland and Wales, respectively.[454] The UK publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover of around £20 billion and employs around 167,000 people.[455] In 2015, the UK published 2,710 book titles per million inhabitants, more than any other country, much of this being exported to other Anglophone countries.[456]\n\n\nIn 2010, 82.5 per cent of the UK population were Internet users, the highest proportion among the 20 countries with the largest total number of users in that year.[457] The British video game industry is the largest in Europe, and, since 2022, the UK has the largest video game market in Europe by sales, overtaking Germany.[458] It is the world's third-largest producer of video games after Japan and the United States.[459]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sport in the United Kingdom and Great Britain at the Olympics\n\n![](image)Golf originated from the Old Course at St Andrews in Scotland.\nAssociation football, tennis, table tennis, badminton, rugby union, rugby league, rugby sevens, golf, boxing, netball, water polo, field hockey, billiards, darts, rowing, rounders and cricket originated or were substantially developed in the UK, with the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in late 19th-century Victorian Britain.[s]\n\n\nA 2003 poll found that football is the most popular sport in the UK.[462] England is recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football, and the Football Association is the oldest of its kind, with the rules of football first drafted in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley.[463] Each of the Home Nations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) has its own football association, national team and league system, and each is individually a governing member of the International Football Association Board alongside FIFA. The English top division, the Premier League, is the most watched football league in the world.[464] The first international football match was contested by England and Scotland on 30 November 1872.[465] England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland usually compete as separate countries in international competitions.[466]\n\n\nIn 2003, rugby union was ranked the second most popular sport in the UK.[462] The sport was created in Rugby School, Warwickshire, and the first rugby international took place on 27 March 1871 between England and Scotland.[467][468] England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy compete in the Six Nations Championship, which is the premier international rugby union tournament in the northern hemisphere. Sports governing bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland organise and regulate the game separately.[469] Every four years, the Home Nations make a combined team known as the British and Irish Lions which tours Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.\n\n\nThe United Kingdom hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1908, 1948 and 2012, with London acting as the host city on all three occasions. Birmingham hosted the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the seventh time a constitute country in the United Kingdom hosted the Commonwealth Games (England, Scotland and Wales have each hosted the Commonwealth Games at least once).[470]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Symbols of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Union Jack flags on The Mall, London\nThe flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag (also referred to as the Union Jack).[471] It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the flag of England, representing Saint George, on the flag of Scotland, representing Saint Andrew, and was updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag.[472] Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out.[473] The national anthem of the United Kingdom is \"God Save the King\", with \"King\" replaced with \"Queen\" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman.\n\n\nBritannia is a national personification of the United Kingdom, originating from Roman Britain.[474] Beside The Lion and the Unicorn and the dragon of heraldry, the bulldog is an iconic animal and commonly represented with the Union Flag.[475] A now rare personification is a character originating in the 18th century, John Bull.[476]\n\n\nEngland, Wales, and Scotland each have a number of their own national symbols, including their national flags. Northern Ireland also has a number of symbols, many of which are shared with Republic of Ireland.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n* ![flag](image)England portal\n* ![icon](image)Northern Ireland portal\n* ![flag](image)Scotland portal\n* ![flag](image)Wales portal\n\n\n* Outline of the United Kingdom\n\t+ Outline of England\n\t+ Outline of Northern Ireland\n\t+ Outline of Scotland\n\t+ Outline of Wales\n* Index of United Kingdom-related articles\n* International rankings of the United Kingdom\n* Historiography of the United Kingdom\n* Historiography of the British Empire\n* United Kingdom–Crown Dependencies Customs Union\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** There is no authorised version of the national anthem as the words are a matter of tradition; only the first verse is usually sung.[1] No statute has been enacted designating \"God Save the King\" as the official anthem. In the English tradition, such laws are not necessary; proclamation and usage are sufficient to make it the national anthem. \"God Save the King\" also serves as the Royal anthem for certain Commonwealth realms. The words *King, he, him, his*, used at present, are replaced by *Queen, she, her* when the monarch is female.\n2. **^** Scots, Ulster Scots, Welsh, Cornish, Scottish Gaelic and Irish are classed as regional or minority languages under the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.[2] These include defined obligations to promote those languages.[3] See also Languages of the United Kingdom. Welsh has limited *de jure* official status in Wales, as well as in the provision of national government services provided for Wales.\n3. **^** \"This category could include Polish responses from the country specific question for Scotland which would have been outputted to 'Other White' and then included under 'White' for UK. 'White Africans' may also have been recorded under 'Other White' and then included under 'White' for UK.\"\n4. **^** 83.6% are White British/Irish.\n5. **^** Although the United Kingdom has traditionally been seen as a unitary state, an alternative description of the UK as a \"union state\", put forward by, among others, Vernon Bogdanor,[4] has become increasingly influential since the adoption of devolution in the 1990s.[5] A union state is considered to differ from a unitary state in that while it maintains a central authority it also recognises the authority of historic rights and infrastructures of its component parts.[6]\n6. **^** Some of the devolved countries, Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories issue their own sterling banknotes or currencies, or use another nation's currency.

The *Guardian* and *Telegraph* use Britain as a synonym for the United Kingdom. Some prefer to use Britain as shorthand for Great Britain. The British Cabinet Office's Government Digital Service style guide for use on gov.uk recommends: \"Use UK and United Kingdom in preference to Britain and British (UK business, UK foreign policy, ambassador and high commissioner). But British embassy, not UK embassy.\"\n12. **^** The phrase \"countries within a country\" is sometimes used to describe the United Kingdom.\n13. **^** The 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty resolved the Irish War of Independence. When it took effect one year later, it established the Irish Free State as a separate dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations. In 1927 the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 changed the name of the UK to reflect this.\n14. **^** The United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution but an unwritten one formed of Acts of Parliament, court judgments, traditions, and conventions.[24]\n15. **^** Compare to section 1 of both of the 1800 Acts of Union which reads: the *Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland shall...be united into one Kingdom, by the Name of \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\"*.\n16. **^** British sovereignty derives from the Crown, a corporation sole occupied by the monarch. It is therefore by and through the monarch that Parliament exercises supreme legislative authority over both the executive and judiciary. Distinguished Professor of Public Law Maurice Sunkin opined the Crown symbolically occupies \"…what in other places would be a core element of a written constitution.\"[163] As a result of this state of constitutional affairs, the monarch is formally referred to as \"the Sovereign\" in legislation.[164]\n17. **^** For instance, the monarch alone appoints the prime minister and confers state honours in the personal gift of the Crown. When necessary, the monarch may also refuse a dissolution or prorogation of Parliament, withhold royal assent to primary legislation, and prevent illegal use of the British Armed Forces, among other reserve powers.[171]\n18. **^** Berkeley is in fact Irish but was called a 'British empiricist' due to the territory of what is now known as the Republic of Ireland being in the UK at the time.\n19. **^** In 2012, the President of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, stated, \"This great, sports-loving country is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern sport. It was here that the concepts of sportsmanship and fair play were first codified into clear rules and regulations. It was here that sport was included as an educational tool in the school curriculum\".[460][461]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Berry, Ciara (15 January 2016). \"National Anthem\".

S2CID 234066376. The UK Internal Market Act gives ministers sweeping powers to enforce mutual recognition and non-discrimination across the four jurisdictions. Existing differences and some social and health matters are exempted but these are much less extensive than the exemptions permitted under the EU Internal Market provisions. Only after an amendment in the House of Lords, the Bill was amended to provide a weak and non-binding consent mechanism for amendments (equivalent to the Sewel Convention) to the list of exemptions. The result is that, while the devolved governments retain regulatory competences, these are undermined by the fact that goods and services originating in, or imported into, England can be marketed anywhere.\n196. **^** Kenny, Michael; McEwen, Nicola (1 March 2021). \"Intergovernmental Relations and the Crisis of the Union\". *Political Insight*. **12** (1).

Taken as a whole, the Internal Market Act imposes greater restrictions upon the competences of the devolved institutions than the provisions of the EU Single Market which it replaced, in spite of pledges to use common frameworks to address these issues. Lord Hope, responsible for many of the leading judgments relating to the first two decades of devolution, regarded the legislation's terms as deliberately confrontational: 'this Parliament can do what it likes, but a different approach is essential if the union is to hold together'.\n199. **^** Dougan, Michael; Hayward, Katy; Hunt, Jo; McEwen, Nicola; McHarg, Aileen; Wincott, Daniel (2020).

The Act has restrictive – and potentially damaging – consequences for the regulatory capacity of the devolved legislatures...This was not the first time since the Brexit referendum that the Convention had been set aside, but it was especially notable given that the primary purpose of the legislation was to constrain the capacity of the devolved institutions to use their regulatory autonomy...in practice, it constrains the ability of the devolved institutions to make effective regulatory choices for their territories in ways that do not apply to the choices made by the UK government and parliament for the English market.\n202. ^ ***a*** ***b*** [195][196][197][198][199][200][201]\n203. **^** \"Structure and powers of the Assembly\". *BBC News*. 9 April 1999.

The UK Parliament is sovereign and the Scottish Parliament is subordinate. The White Paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation. The Scottish Parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of Scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority. Following the logic of this argument, the power of the Scottish Parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden...; Elliot, M. (2004). \"United Kingdom: Parliamentary sovereignty under pressure\". *International Journal of Constitutional Law*. **2** (3): 545–627, 553–554. doi:10.1093/icon/2.3.545. Notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes, an important common factor is that the UK Parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned. For example, the Scottish Parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters, save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied ... but this power to legislate on what may be termed \"devolved matters\" is concurrent with the Westminster Parliament's general power to legislate for Scotland on any matter at all, including devolved matters ... In theory, therefore, Westminster may legislate on Scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses...\n206. **^** Gamble, A.

The British parliament has the power to abolish the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses, but since both were sanctioned by referenda, it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people. In this way, several of the constitutional measures introduced by the Blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster.\n207. **^** Meehan, E.

[T]he distinctive involvement of two governments in the Northern Irish problem means that Northern Ireland's new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement. If this can be equated with a treaty, it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between Westminster and Belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states...Although the Agreement makes the general proviso that Westminster's 'powers to make legislation for Northern Ireland' remains 'unaffected', without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters, it may be more difficult than in Scotland or Wales for devolved powers to be repatriated. The retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in Northern Ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement.\n208. **^** May, Theresa (29 March 2017). \"Prime Minister's letter to Donald Tusk triggering Article 50\" – via Gov.uk.\n209. **^** Swaine, Jon (13 January 2009). \"Barack Obama presidency will strengthen special relationship, says Gordon Brown\". *The Telegraph*.

The total area of the United Kingdom is 93,628 square miles (242,495 km2), with an estimated 2022 population of nearly 67 million people.\n\n\nThe United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. The Treaty of Union between the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707 resulted in their unification to become the Kingdom of Great Britain. Its union in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted its name in 1927.[m] The nearby Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey are not part of the UK, being Crown Dependencies, but the British government is responsible for their defence and international representation.[18]\n\n\nThe UK became the first industrialised country and was the world's foremost power for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly during the \"Pax Britannica\" between 1815 and 1914.[19][20] The British Empire, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and population, and was the largest empire in history; however, its involvement in the First World War and the Second World War damaged Britain's economic power and a global wave of decolonisation led to the independence of most British colonies.[21][22][23] British influence can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of its former colonies, and the UK's culture remains globally influential, particularly in literature, music and sport.\n\n\nThe United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy.[n][25] The capital and largest city of the United Kingdom (as well as the capital of England) is London. The cities of Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast are respectively the national capitals of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Other major cities include Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, and Leeds.[26] The UK consists of three distinct legal jurisdictions: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. This is due to these areas retaining their existing legal systems even after joining the UK.[27] Since 1998, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also have their own devolved governments and legislatures, each with varying powers.[28]\n\n\nThe UK has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal gross domestic product (GDP), and the ninth-largest by purchasing power parity. It is a recognised nuclear state and is ranked fourth globally in military expenditure.[29][30] The UK has been a permanent member of the UN Security Council since its first session in 1946. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the OECD, NATO, the Five Eyes, AUKUS and the CPTPP.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and terminology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Britain (place name) and Terminology of the British Isles\n\nIn 43 AD, *Britannia* referred to the Roman province that encompassed modern England and Wales. Great Britain encompassed the whole island, taking in the land north of the River Forth known to the Romans as Caledonia in modern Scotland (i.e. \"greater\" Britain).[31] In the Middle Ages, the name \"Britain\" was also applied to a small part of France now known as Brittany. As a result, Great Britain (likely from the French \"*Grande Bretagne*\") came into use to refer specifically to the island, with Brittany often referred to as \"Little Britain\".[32] However, that name had no official significance until 1707, when the island's kingdoms of England and Scotland were united as the Kingdom of Great Britain.[33]\n\n\nThe Acts of Union 1707 declared that the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland were \"United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain\".[o][34] The term \"United Kingdom\" has occasionally been used as a description for the former Kingdom of Great Britain, although its official name from 1707 to 1800 was simply \"Great Britain\".[35] The Acts of Union 1800 united the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the partition of Ireland and the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922, which left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland within the United Kingdom, the name was changed in 1927 to the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\".[36]\n\n\nAlthough the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also widely referred to as countries.[37] The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase \"countries within a country\" to describe the United Kingdom.[16] Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve NUTS 1 regions refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as \"regions\".[38] Northern Ireland is also referred to as a \"province\".[39] With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used \"can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences\".[40]\n\n\nThe term \"Great Britain\" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination.[41] It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole.[42] The word *England* is occasionally used incorrectly to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole, a mistake principally made by people from outside the UK.[43]\n\n\nThe term \"Britain\" is used as a synonym for Great Britain,[44][45] and the United Kingdom.[46][45] Usage is mixed: the UK Government prefers to use the term \"UK\" rather than \"Britain\" or \"British\" on its website (except when referring to embassies),[47] while acknowledging that both terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere \"British government\" is used at least as frequently as \"United Kingdom government\".[48] The UK Permanent Committee on Geographical Names recognises \"United Kingdom\", \"UK\" and \"U.K.\" as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list \"Britain\" but notes that \"it is only the one specific nominal term 'Great Britain' which invariably excludes Northern Ireland\".[48] The BBC historically preferred to use \"Britain\" as shorthand only for Great Britain, though the present style guide does not take a position except that \"Great Britain\" excludes Northern Ireland.[49]\n\n\nThe adjective \"British\" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and matters to do with nationality.[50] People of the United Kingdom use several different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being British, English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish, or Irish;[51] or as having a combination of different national identities.[52] The official designation for a citizen of the United Kingdom is \"British citizen\".[48]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and History of the British Isles\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of British history.\n\n### Prior to the Treaty of Union[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of England, History of Wales, History of Scotland, and History of Ireland\n\n![](image)Stonehenge in Wiltshire is a ring of stones, each about 4 m (13 ft) high, 2 m (7 ft) wide and 25 tonnes, erected 2400–2200 BC.\nSettlement by Cro-Magnons of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago.[53] By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland.[54]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of the Baths showing a rectangular area of greenish water surrounded by yellow stone buildings with pillars. In the background is the tower of the abbey.](image)The Roman Baths in Bath, Somerset, are a well-preserved *thermae* from Roman Britain.\nThe Roman conquest, beginning in 43 AD, and the 400-year rule of southern Britain, was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly to what was to become Wales, Cornwall and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Hen Ogledd (northern England and parts of southern Scotland).[55] Most of the region settled by the Anglo-Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century.[56] Meanwhile, Gaelic-speakers in north-west Britain (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century)[57] united with the Picts to create the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings, 1066, and the events leading to it.\nIn 1066, the Normans invaded England from northern France. After conquering England, they seized large parts of Wales, conquered much of Ireland and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern French model and Norman-French culture.[59] The Anglo-Norman ruling class greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, the local cultures.[60] Subsequent medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and tried unsuccessfully to annex Scotland. Asserting its independence in the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath, Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in near-constant conflict with England.\n\n\nThe English monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the Hundred Years' War, while the Kings of Scots were in an alliance with the French during this period.[61]\nEarly modern Britain saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country.[62] The English Reformation ushered in political, constitutional, social and cultural change in the 16th century and established the Church of England. Moreover, it defined a national identity for England and slowly, but profoundly, changed people's religious beliefs.[63] Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England,[64] and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown.[65] In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland.[66]\n\n\nIn 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI, King of Scots, inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal, and religious institutions.[67]\n\n\nIn the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the execution of King Charles I, and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.[68]\n\n\nAlthough the monarchy was restored, the Interregnum along with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the subsequent Bill of Rights 1689 in England and Claim of Right Act 1689 in Scotland ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system.[69] With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America and the Caribbean.[70]\n\n\nThough previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the Treaty of Union of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.\n\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Great Britain[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Treaty of Union and Kingdom of Great Britain\n\n![](image)The Treaty of Union led to a united kingdom of all of Great Britain.\nOn 1 May 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the Acts of Union 1707.[71]\n\n\nIn the 18th century, cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole, in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of Jacobite uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs. The British colonies in North America that broke away in the American War of Independence became the United States, recognised by Britain in 1783. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to India.[72]\n\n\nBritain played a leading part in the Atlantic slave trade, mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British-colonial slave ships transported nearly 3.3 million slaves from Africa.[73] The slaves were taken to work on plantations, principally in the Caribbean but also North America.[74] Slavery coupled with the Caribbean sugar industry had a significant role in strengthening the British economy in the 18th century.[75] However, with pressure from the abolitionism movement, Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the blockade of Africa and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties.[76]\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United Kingdom, Acts of Union (1800), and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\n\nIn 1801 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)The opening engagement at the Battle of Trafalgar, by J.W. Carmichael\nAfter the defeat of France at the end of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830).[78] Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as *Pax Britannica* (\"British Peace\"), a period of relative peace among the Great Powers (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman.[79] By the time of the Great Exhibition of 1851, Britain was described as the \"workshop of the world\".[80] From 1853 to 1856, Britain took part in the Crimean War, allied with the Ottoman Empire against Tsarist Russia,[81] participating in the naval battles of the Baltic Sea known as the Åland War in the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland, among others.[82] Following the Indian Rebellion in 1857, the British government led by Lord Palmerston assumed direct rule over India. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of regions such as East Asia and Latin America.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Victoria reigned as Queen of the United Kingdom and Empress of India during the 19th century.Throughout the Victorian era, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies, as well as a gradual widening of the voting franchise, with the 1884 Reform Act championed by William Gladstone granting suffrage to a majority of males for the first time. The British population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses.[84] By the late 19th century, the Conservatives under Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury initiated a period of imperial expansion in Africa, maintained a policy of splendid isolation in Europe, and attempted to contain Russian influence in Afghanistan and Persia, in what came to be known as the Great Game.[85] During this time, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were granted self-governing dominion status.[86] At the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the German Empire and the United States.[87] The Edwardian era saw social reform and home rule for Ireland become important domestic issues, while the Labour Party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900, and suffragettes campaigned for women's right to vote.[88]\n\n\n### World wars and partition of Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United Kingdom during the First World War, Partition of Ireland, Interwar Britain, United Kingdom home front during the Second World War, and Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II\n\n![](image)Wreaths being laid during the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London\nBritain was one of the principal Allies that defeated the Central Powers in the First World War (1914–1918). Alongside their French, Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts,[89] British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the Western Front.[90] The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt.[90] The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections with the Representation of the People Act 1918.[90] After the war, Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the League of Nations and received a mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies. Under the leadership of David Lloyd George, the British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.[91]\n\n\nBy the mid-1920s, most of the British population could listen to BBC radio programmes.[92][93] Experimental television broadcasts began in 1929 and the first scheduled BBC Television Service commenced in 1936.[94] The rise of Irish nationalism, and disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish Home Rule, led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921.[95] The Irish Free State became independent, initially with Dominion status in 1922, and unambiguously independent in 1931. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.[96] The 1928 Equal Franchise Act gave women electoral equality with men in national elections. Strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the General Strike of 1926, which ended in a victory for the government led by Stanley Baldwin. Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War when the Great Depression (1929–1932) led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. A coalition government was formed in 1931.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Spitfire and Hurricane as flown in the Battle of Britain during the Second World War\nNonetheless, \"Britain was a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system.\"[98] After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Britain entered the Second World War. Winston Churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year, Britain and its Empire continued the war against Germany. Churchill engaged industry, scientists and engineers to support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort.[98]\n\n\nIn 1940, the Royal Air Force defeated the German Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz. The Grand Alliance of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union formed in 1941, leading the Allies against the Axis powers. There were eventual hard-fought victories in the Battle of the Atlantic, the North Africa campaign and the Italian campaign. British forces played important roles in the Normandy landings of 1944 and the liberation of Europe. The British Army led the Burma campaign against Japan, and the British Pacific Fleet fought Japan at sea. British scientists contributed to the Manhattan Project whose task was to build an atomic weapon.[99] Once built, it was decided, with British consent, to use the weapon against Japan.[100]\n\n\n\n### Postwar 20th century[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Postwar Britain (1945–1979) and Social history of Postwar Britain (1945–1979)\n\n![](image)The British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921\nThe UK was one of the Big Three powers (along with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the post-war world;[101] it was an original signatory to the Declaration by United Nations and became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. It worked closely with the United States to establish the IMF, World Bank and NATO.[102] The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the Marshall Plan,[103] but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe.[104]\n\n\nIn the immediate post-war years, the Labour government under Clement Attlee initiated a radical programme of reforms, which significantly impacted British society in the following decades.[105] Major industries and public utilities were nationalised, a welfare state was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the National Health Service, was created.[106] The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's much-diminished economic position, so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable. Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947.[107] Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence, and many became members of the Commonwealth of Nations.[108]\n\n\n\n![](image)Concorde was a supersonic airliner that reduced transatlantic flight time from 8 hours to 3.5 hours.[109]\nThe UK was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal (with its first atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane, in 1952), but the post-war limits of Britain's international role were illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956. The international spread of the English language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture.[110][111] As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government encouraged immigration from Commonwealth countries. In the following decades, the UK became a more multi-ethnic society.[112] Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France, West Germany and Japan.\n\n\nIn the decades-long process of European integration, the UK was a founding member of the Western European Union, established with the London and Paris Conferences in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the European Communities (EC). In a 1975 referendum 67% voted to stay in it.[113] When the EC became the European Union (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states.\n\n\nFrom the late 1960s, Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK) conventionally known as the Troubles. It is usually considered to have ended with the 1998 Belfast \"Good Friday\" Agreement.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Canary Wharf, a symbol of the financial reforms initiated by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s\nFollowing a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the Conservative government of the 1980s led by Margaret Thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism, deregulation, particularly of the financial sector (for example, the Big Bang in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.[115]\n\n\nIn 1982, Argentina invaded the British territories of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, leading to the 10-week Falklands War in which Argentine forces were defeated. The inhabitants of the islands are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty, expressed in a 2013 referendum. From 1984, the UK economy was helped by the inflow of substantial North Sea oil revenues.[116]\n\n\nAround the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[117] The statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the European Convention on Human Rights. The UK remained a Great Power with global diplomatic and military influence and a leading role in the United Nations and NATO.[118]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Political history of the United Kingdom (1979–present) and Social history of the United Kingdom (1979–present)\n\n![](image)Pro-Brexit campaigners outside Parliament in London in November 2016, after the Brexit referendum\nThe UK broadly supported the United States' approach to the \"war on terror\" in the early 21st century.[119] British troops fought in the War in Afghanistan, but controversy surrounded Britain's military deployment in Iraq, which saw the largest protest in British history demonstrating in opposition to the government led by Tony Blair.[120]\n\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis severely affected the UK economy.[121] The Cameron–Clegg coalition government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits.[122] Studies have suggested that policy led to significant social disruption and suffering.[123][124] A referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 resulted in the Scottish electorate voting by 55.3 to 44.7% to remain part of the United Kingdom.[125]\n\n\nIn 2016, 51.9 per cent of voters in the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.[126] The UK left the EU in 2020.[127] On 1 May 2021 the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement came into force.[128]\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the UK's economy, caused major disruptions to education and had far-reaching impacts on society and politics in 2020 and 2021.[129][130][131] The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to use an approved COVID-19 vaccine, developing its own vaccine through a collaboration between Oxford University and AstraZeneca, which allowed the UK's vaccine rollout to be among the fastest in the world.[132][133]\n\n\nOn 8 September 2022, Elizabeth II, the longest-living and longest-reigning British monarch, died at the age of 96.[134] Upon the Queen's death, her eldest child Charles, Prince of Wales, acceded to the British throne as Charles III.[135]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of the United Kingdom, Fauna of Great Britain, and Flora of Great Britain and Ireland\n\n![](image)Satellite image of the United Kingdom (excluding Shetland)\nThe total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 244,820 square kilometres (94,530 sq mi). The country occupies the major part of the British Isles[136] archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel.[137]\n\n\nThe Royal Greenwich Observatory in London was chosen as the defining point of the Prime Meridian[138] at the International Meridian Conference in 1884.[139]\n\n\nThe United Kingdom lies between latitudes 49° and 61° N, and longitudes 9° W and 2° E. Northern Ireland shares a 224-mile (360 km) land boundary with the Republic of Ireland.[137] The coastline of Great Britain is 11,073 miles (17,820 km) long.[140] It is connected to continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel, which at 31 miles (50 km) (24 miles (38 km) underwater) is the longest underwater tunnel in the world.[141]\n\n\nThe UK contains four terrestrial ecoregions: Celtic broadleaf forests, English Lowlands beech forests, North Atlantic moist mixed forests, and Caledon conifer forests.[142] The area of woodland in the UK in 2023 is estimated to be 3.25 million hectares, which represents 13% of the total land area in the UK.[143]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate of the United Kingdom and Climate change in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Köppen climate types of the UK\nMost of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round.[137] The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0 °C (32 °F) or rising above 30 °C (86 °F).[144] Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate (*Cfc*). Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate (*Dfc*) and the mountains experience a tundra climate (*ET*).[145]\n\n\nThe prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean,[137] although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind. Since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions, the eastern parts are the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters, especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.[146]\n\n\nThe average total annual sunshine in the United Kingdom is 1339.7 hours, which is just under 30% of the maximum possible.[147] The hours of sunshine vary from 1200 to about 1580 hours per year, and since 1996 the UK has been and still is receiving above the 1981 to 2010 average hours of sunshine.[148]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the United Kingdom is ranked 2nd out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[149] A law has been passed that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050.[150]\n\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nEngland accounts for 53 per cent of the UK, covering 50,350 square miles (130,395 km2).[151] Most of the country consists of lowland terrain,[152] with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees–Exe line which roughly divides the UK into lowland and upland areas. Lowland areas include Cornwall, the New Forest, the South Downs and the Norfolk Broads. Upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, and Dartmoor. The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames, Severn, and the Humber. England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike, at 978 metres (3,209 ft) in the Lake District; its largest island is the Isle of Wight.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Skiddaw massif, Keswick and Derwent Water in the Lake District\n![](image)\nSkye is one of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides and part of the Scottish Highlands.\n\nScotland accounts for 32 per cent of the UK, covering 30,410 square miles (78,772 km2).[153] This includes nearly 800 islands,[154] notably the Hebrides, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands. Scotland is the most mountainous constituent country of the UK, the Highlands to the north and west are the more rugged region containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous land, including the Cairngorms, Loch Lomond and The Trossachs and Ben Nevis which at 1,345 metres (4,413 ft)[155] is the highest point in the British Isles.[156]\n\n\nWales accounts for less than 9 per cent of the UK, covering 8,020 square miles (20,779 km2).[157] Wales is mostly mountainous, though South Wales is less mountainous than North and mid Wales. The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon (Welsh: *Yr Wyddfa*) which, at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft), is the highest peak in Wales.[152] Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,704 kilometres) of coastline including the Pembrokeshire Coast.[140] Several islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is Anglesey (*Ynys Môn*).\n\n\nNorthern Ireland, separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and North Channel, has an area of 5,470 square miles (14,160 km2) and is mostly hilly. It includes Lough Neagh which, at 150 square miles (388 km2), is the largest lake in the British Isles by area,[158] Lough Erne which has over 150 islands and the Giant's Causeway which is a World Heritage Site. The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at 852 metres (2,795 ft).[152]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of the United Kingdom, Government of the United Kingdom, and Monarchy of the United Kingdom\n\n![King Charles III](image)\nCharles III, Monarch since 2022\n![Rishi Sunak](image)\nRishi Sunak, Prime Minister since 2022\n\nThe UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy operating under the Westminster system, otherwise known as a \"democratic parliamentary monarchy\".[159] It is a centralised, unitary state[160][161] wherein the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign.[162] Parliament is made up of the elected House of Commons, the appointed House of Lords and the Crown (as personified by the monarch).[p][165] The main business of parliament takes place in the two houses,[165] but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of parliament (that is, statute law).[166] As a result of parliamentary sovereignty, the British constitution is uncodified, consisting mostly of disparate written sources, including parliamentary statutes, judge-made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions.[167] Nevertheless, the Supreme Court recognises a number of principles underlying the British constitution, such as parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy, and upholding international law.[168]\n\n\nKing Charles III is the current monarch and head of state of the UK and of 14 other independent countries. These 15 countries are today referred to as \"Commonwealth realms\". The monarch is formally vested with all executive authority as the personal embodiment of the Crown and is \"...fundamental to the law and working of government in the UK.\"[169] The disposition of such powers however, including those belonging to the royal prerogative, is generally exercised only on the advice of ministers of the Crown responsible to Parliament and thence to the electorate. Nevertheless, in the performance of official duties, the monarch has \"the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn\".[170] In addition, the monarch has a number of reserve powers at his disposal, albeit rarely used, to uphold responsible government and prevent constitutional crises.[q]\n\n\n\n![Large sand-coloured building of Gothic design beside brown river and road bridge. The building has several large towers, including large clock tower.](image)The Palace of Westminster in London is the seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nFor general elections (elections to the House of Commons), the UK is currently divided into 650 constituencies, each of which is represented by one member of Parliament (MP) elected by the first-past-the-post system.[172] MPs hold office for up to five years and must then stand for re-election if they wish to continue to be an MP.[172] The Conservative Party, colloquially known as the Tory Party or the Tories, and the Labour Party have been the dominant political parties in the UK since the 1920s, leading to the UK being described as a two-party system. However, since the 1920s other political parties have won seats in the House of Commons, although never more than the Conservatives or Labour.[173]\n\n\nThe prime minister is the head of government in the UK.[174] Acting under the direction and supervision of a Cabinet of senior ministers selected and led by the prime minister, the Government serves as the principal instrument for public policymaking, administers public services and, through the Privy Council, promulgates statutory instruments and tenders advice to the monarch.[175][176][177]\nNearly all prime ministers have served concurrently as First Lord of the Treasury[178] and all prime ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since 1905,[179] Minister for the Civil Service since 1968,[180] and Minister for the Union since 2019.[181] While appointed by the monarch, in modern times the prime minister is, by convention, an MP, the leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons, and holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons.[182][183][184] The current Prime Minister, as of October 2022, is Rishi Sunak MP, leader of the Conservative Party.\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Countries of the United Kingdom, Administrative geography of the United Kingdom, and List of counties in the United Kingdom\n\nThe geographical division of the United Kingdom into counties or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages, and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early Modern Period.[185] Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and Wales in 1888, Scotland in 1889 and Ireland in 1898, meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the UK.[186]\nUntil the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.[187]\n\n\nLocal government in England is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine regions, now used primarily for statistical purposes.[188] One of the regions, Greater London, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a 1998 referendum.[189]\n\n\nLocal government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. The cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas, as is the Highland Council, which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000 people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.[190]\n\n\nLocal government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself. These include the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, which are unitary authorities in their own right.[191] Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system.[191]\n\n\nLocal government in Northern Ireland since 1973, has been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as waste collection, dog control, and maintaining parks and cemeteries.[192] In 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system.[193]\n\n\n\n### Devolved governments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Devolution in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)\n![England](image) England\n\n![Scotland](image) Scotland\n\n![Wales](image) Wales\n\nNorthern  \nIreland\nThe four countries of the United Kingdom\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Population | Total area\n | Capital | Parliament | First Minister\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) England | 56,489,800 (2021) | 130,279 km2 (50,301 sq mi)\n | London | none\n | none\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | 5,436,600 (2022) | 77,933 km2 (30,090.1 sq mi)\n | Edinburgh | Scottish Parliament | Humza Yousaf |\n| ![](image) Wales | 3,267,501 (2022) | 20,779 km2 (8,022.82 sq mi)\n | Cardiff | Senedd | Mark Drakeford |\n| Northern Ireland | 1,903,100 (2021) | 14,130 km2 (5,455.62 sq mi)\n | Belfast | Northern Ireland Assembly | vacant\n |\n\n\n#### Scotland[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Scottish Parliament, Scottish Government, and Local government in Scotland\n\nSince 1999, Scotland has had a devolved national government and legislature called the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government and Parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK Parliament, including education, healthcare, Scots law and local government.[194] Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an act of the UK parliament passed in 2020.[202] The current Scottish Government is a Scottish National Party and Scottish Greens coalition, led by First Minister Humza Yousaf, leader of the Scottish National Party. In 2014, the Scottish independence referendum was held, with 55.3% voting against independence from the United Kingdom and 44.7% voting in favour, resulting in Scotland staying within the United Kingdom. Local government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.[190]\n\n\n\n#### Wales[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Senedd, Welsh Government, and Local government in Wales\n\nSince 1999, Wales has a devolved national government and legislature, known as the Senedd. Elections to the Senedd use the additional member system. They have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.[203] The Senedd is able to legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament through Acts of Senedd Cymru. The current Welsh Government is Labour, led by First Minister Mark Drakeford, who has been the First Minister since 2018. Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself.\n\n\n\n#### Northern Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Northern Ireland Assembly, Northern Ireland Executive, Local government in Northern Ireland, and The Troubles\n\nSince 1998, Northern Ireland has a devolved government, the Executive, and legislature, the Assembly. Elections to the Assembly use the single transferable vote system. The Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly.[204] The Island of Ireland has a turbulent and violent modern political history, a period referred to as the Troubles. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement acts as a *de facto* constitution for Northern Ireland. Local government in Northern Ireland since 2015 has been divided between 11 councils with limited responsibilities.[192]\n\n\n\n#### Constitutional arrangement[edit]\n\n\nThe UK does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly.[205] In practice, it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd, because these institutions were created by referendum decisions.[206] The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater still, because devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the Government of Ireland.[207] The UK Parliament restricts the three devolved parliaments' legislative competence in economic areas through an act passed in 2020.[202]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of the United Kingdom and Foreign policy of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak greets US President Joe Biden at the 2022 G-20 Bali Summit.\nThe UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of NATO, AUKUS, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.[208] The UK has the British Council which is a British organisation based in over 100 countries specialising in international cultural and educational opportunities. The UK is said to have a \"Special Relationship\" with the United States and a close partnership with France – the \"Entente cordiale\" – and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries;[209][210] the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world. The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a Common Travel Area and co-operate through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council. Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and military engagements.[211] Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are former colonies of the British Empire which share King Charles as their head of state, are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by British people.[212]\n\n\n\n### Dependencies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British Overseas Territories, Crown Dependencies, British Islands, and List of leaders of British dependencies\n\nThe United Kingdom, the 14 British Overseas Territories[213] and the three Crown Dependencies[214] form 'one undivided Realm'.[215][216] All parts of the realm are under the sovereignty of the British Crown, but the Territories and Dependencies are not part of the UK. This is distinct from the status of Commonwealth realms, who have separate monarchies, but share the same monarch.[216]\n\n\nTemplate:UK territories image map\n\n\nThe 14 British Overseas Territories are remnants of the British Empire: Anguilla; Bermuda; the British Antarctic Territory; the British Indian Ocean Territory; the British Virgin Islands; the Cayman Islands; the Falkland Islands; Gibraltar; Montserrat; Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha; the Turks and Caicos Islands; the Pitcairn Islands; South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; and Akrotiri and Dhekelia on the island of Cyprus.[217] British claims in Antarctica have limited international recognition.[218] Collectively Britain's overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of 480,000 square nautical miles (640,000 sq mi; 1,600,000 km2),[219] with a total population of approximately 250,000.[220] The overseas territories also give the UK the world's fifth largest exclusive economic zone at 6,805,586 km2 (2,627,651 sq mi).[221]\n\n\nThe Crown Dependencies are possessions of the Crown, as opposed to territories of the UK.[222] They comprise three independently administered jurisdictions: the Bailiwicks of Jersey and of Guernsey in the English Channel, and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. By mutual agreement, the British Government manages the islands' foreign affairs and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf. Internationally, they are regarded as \"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\".[223] The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown (Privy Council or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor).[224] Since 2005, each Crown dependency has had a Chief Minister as its head of government.[225]\n\n\n\n### Law and criminal justice[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law of the United Kingdom, Censorship in the United Kingdom, and Crime in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and civil cases in Scotland.\nThe United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as Article 19 of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system.[226] Today the UK has three distinct systems of law: English law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law. A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.[227] The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies.[228]\n\n\nBoth English law, which applies in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland law are based on common-law principles.[229] The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases).[230] Scots law is a hybrid system based on common-law and civil-law principles. The chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases,[231] and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases.[232] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.[233]\n\n\nCrime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66 per cent in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015,[234] according to crime statistics. The prison population of England and Wales has increased to 86,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 148 per 100,000.[235]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage has been legal in England, Scotland, and Wales since 2014, and in Northern Ireland since 2020.[236] LGBT equality in the United Kingdom is considered advanced by modern standards.[237][238]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British Armed Forces and Military history of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)\nHMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales\n![](image)\nRoyal Navy Destroyer HMS Defender\n![](image)\nRoyal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon Jet\n![](image)\nBritish Army Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank\n\n*His Majesty's Armed Forces* consist of three professional service branches: the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (forming the Naval Service), the British Army and the Royal Air Force.[239] The armed forces of the United Kingdom are managed by the Ministry of Defence and controlled by the Defence Council, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence. The Commander-in-Chief is the British monarch, to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance.[240] The Armed Forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in NATO, including the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, the Five Power Defence Arrangements, RIMPAC and other worldwide coalition operations. Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in Ascension Island, Bahrain, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Oman, Qatar and Singapore.[241]\n\n\nAccording to sources which include the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the UK has either the fourth- or the fifth-highest military expenditure. Total defence spending amounts to 2.0 per cent of national GDP.[242] Following the end of the Cold War, defence policy has a stated assumption that \"the most demanding operations\" will be undertaken as part of a coalition.[243]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)London is the largest urban economy in Europe[244] and, alongside New York, the city in the world most integrated with the global economy.[245]\nThe UK has a partially regulated market economy.[246] Based on market exchange rates, the UK is the sixth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe by nominal GDP.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based.\nThe United Kingdom uses the pound sterling, currently the fourth most-traded currency in the foreign exchange market and the world's fourth-largest reserve currency (after the United States dollar, euro, and yen).[247] The pound sterling was the best performing currency in the first quarter of 2023, gaining 2.5pc against the dollar, ahead of all other G10 economies.[248] London is the world capital for foreign exchange trading, with a global market share of 38.1% in 2022[249] of the daily $7.5 trillion global turnover.[250] HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and is responsible for issuing notes and coins in the pound sterling. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue.\n\n\nThe service sector made up around 80% of the UK's GVA in 2021.[251] As of 2022, the UK is the world's second-largest exporter of services.[252] London is one of the world's largest financial centres, ranking second in the world in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2022. London also has the largest city GDP in Europe.[253] Edinburgh ranks 17th in the world, and sixth in Western Europe in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2020.[254] Tourism is very important to the British economy; London was named as Europe's most popular destination for 2022.[255][256] The creative industries accounted for 5.9% of the UK's GVA in 2019, having grown by 43.6% in real terms from 2010.[257] Creative industries contributed more than £111bn to the UK economy in 2018, growth in the sector is more than five times larger than growth across the UK economy as a whole as reported in 2018.[258] Lloyd's of London is the world's largest insurance and reinsurance market and is located in London.[259] WPP plc, the world's biggest advertising company, is also based in the UK.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aston Martin manufacture vehicles in Gaydon, England.\nThe automotive industry employs around 800,000 people, with a turnover in 2022 of £67 billion, generating £27 billion of exports (10% of the UK's total export of goods). In 2022, the UK produced around 775,000 passenger vehicles and 101,600 commercial vehicles, including luxury cars such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Range Rover. The UK is a major centre for engine manufacturing: in 2022 around 1.5 million engines were produced.[260] It is also the world's fourth-largest exporter of engines, as of 2021.[261] The UK motorsport industry employs more than 40,000 people, comprises around 4,300 companies and has an annual turnover of around £10 billion.[262] 7 of the 10 Formula One teams are based in the UK, with their technology being used in supercars and hypercars from McLaren, Aston Martin and Lotus.\n\n\nThe aerospace industry of the UK is the second largest national aerospace industry in the world depending upon the method of measurement and has an annual turnover of around £30 billion.[263] The UK space industry was worth £17.5bn in 2020/21 and employed 48,800 people. Since 2012, the number of space organisations has grown on average nearly 21% per year, with 1,293 organisations reported in 2021.[264][265] The UK Space Agency has stated in 2023 that it is investing £1.6 billion in space related projects.[266]\n\n\nThe agriculture industry is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing about 60 per cent of food needs with less than 1.6 per cent of the labour force (535,000 workers).[267] Around two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one-third to arable crops. The UK retains a significant, though much reduced fishing industry. It is also rich in a variety of natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, silica and an abundance of arable land.[268]\n\n\nThe United Kingdom has among the highest levels of income inequality in Europe[269] and the OECD,[270] and is one of the most regionally unequal high-income countries in the world.[271][272]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Science and technology in the United Kingdom and Telecommunications in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Cambridge is the most intensive research cluster for science and technology in the world.[273]\nEngland and Scotland were leading centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century.[274] The United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances.[275] Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science;[276] from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory; and more recently Stephen Hawking, who advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes.[277]\n\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) is responsible for helping to encourage, develop and manage the UK's scientific, research, and technological outputs. Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry.[278] In 2022 the UK retained its number one spot for technology in Europe reaching a combined market value of $1 trillion. Cambridge was named the number one university in the world for producing successful technology founders.[279]\n\n\nThe UK was ranked fourth in the Global Innovation Index 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, which is based on around 80 indicators, including measures of the political environment, education, infrastructure and knowledge creation.[280][273] During 2022, the UK produced 6.3 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had a 10.5 per cent share of scientific citations, the third highest in the world (for both). The UK ranked 1st in the world for Field-Weighted Citation Impact.[281] Scientific journals produced in the UK include publications by the *Royal Society*, *Nature*, the *British Medical Journal* and *The Lancet*.[282]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)A high-speed East Coast Main Line train in Northumberland\nA radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads.[137] The M25, encircling London, is the largest and busiest bypass in the world.[283] In 2022, there were a total of 40.8 million licensed vehicles in Great Britain.[284]\n\n\nThe UK has an extensive railway network of 10,072 miles (16,209 km). In Great Britain, the British Rail network was privatised between 1994 and 1997, followed by a rapid rise in passenger numbers. The UK was ranked eighth among national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index assessing intensity of use, quality of service and safety.[285] High Speed 2 (HS2) is a new high speed railway under construction linking up London, the Midlands, the North and Scotland, serving over 25 stations, including eight of Britain's 10 largest cities and connecting around 30 million people, capable of speeds of up to 225 mph.[286][287] Crossrail, which was renamed the Elizabeth line in 2016, in honour of Queen Elizabeth II, opened in 2022. It was Europe's largest construction project at the time and will bring in an estimated £42 billion to the UK economy.[288][289]\n\n\n\n![](image)London has the busiest city airport system in the world.\nGreat British Railways is a planned state-owned public body that will oversee rail transport in Great Britain. In 2014, there were 5.2 billion bus journeys in the UK, 2.4 billion of which were in London.[290] The red double-decker bus has entered popular culture as an internationally recognised icon of England.[291] The London bus network is extensive, with over 6,800 scheduled services every weekday carrying about six million passengers on over 700 different routes making it one of the most extensive bus systems in the world and the largest in Europe.[292]\n\n\nIn the year from October 2009 to September 2010, UK airports handled a total of 211.4 million passengers.[293] In that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport (65.6 million passengers), Gatwick Airport (31.5 million passengers) and London Stansted Airport (18.9 million passengers).[293] London Heathrow Airport, located 15 miles (24 km) west of the capital, is the world's second busiest airport by international passenger traffic and has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world;[294] it is the hub for the UK flag carrier British Airways, as well as Virgin Atlantic.[295]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Wind turbines overlooking Ardrossan in Scotland. The UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is its fastest-growing supply.\nIn 2021, the UK was the world's 14th-largest consumer of energy and the 22nd-largest producer.[296] The UK is home to many large energy companies, including two of the six major oil and gas companies – BP and Shell.[297]\n\n\nThe total of all renewable electricity sources provided 43% of the electricity generated in the UK in 2020.[298] The UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is the country's fastest-growing supply; in 2022, 26.8% of the UK's total electricity was generated by wind power.[299] The UK has the largest offshore wind farm in the world, which is located off the coast of Yorkshire.[300]\n\n\nIn 2023, the UK had 9 nuclear reactors normally generating about 15 per cent of the UK's electricity.[301] Unlike Germany and Japan, there are two reactors under construction and more planned.[302][303] In the late 1990s, nuclear power plants contributed around 25 per cent of the total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down. The UK government is investing in Small Modular Reactors and Advanced Modular Reactors research and development.\n\n\nIn 2021, the UK produced 935 thousand barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil (and other liquids) and consumed 1,258 thousand bbl/d.[296] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005.[304] In 2020[update], the UK had around 2 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves.[304]\n\n\nIn 2021, the UK was the 21st-largest producer of natural gas in the world.[305] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004.[305] In 2020, the UK produced 1.8 million tonnes of coal falling 91% in 10 years.[301] In 2020 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 26 million tonnes.[301] The UK Coal Authority has stated that there is a potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification (UCG) or 'fracking',[306] and based on current UK coal consumption, such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years.[307]\n\n\n\n### Water supply and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom\n\nAccess to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal. It is estimated that 96 per cent of households are connected to the sewer network.[308] According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007.[309]\n\n\nIn England and Wales water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private \"water only\" companies. In Scotland, water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company, Scottish Water. In Northern Ireland water and sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity, Northern Ireland Water.[310]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demography of the United Kingdom, British people, and Ceremonial counties of England\n\nIn the 2011 census the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775.[311] It is the fourth-largest in Europe (after Russia, Germany and France), the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world. In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth. In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth.[312] Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 per cent.[311] The 2011 census also showed that, over the previous 100 years, the proportion of the population aged 0–14 fell from 31 per cent to 18 per cent, and the proportion of people aged 65 and over rose from 5 to 16 per cent.[311] In 2018 the median age of the UK population was 41.7 years.[313]\n\n\nEngland's population in 2011 was 53 million, representing some 84 per cent of the UK total.[314] It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 420 people per square kilometre in mid-2015,[312] with a particular concentration in London and the south-east.[315] The 2011 census put Scotland's population at 5.3 million,[316] Wales at 3.06 million and Northern Ireland at 1.81 million.[314]\n\n\nIn 2017 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across the UK was 1.74 children born per woman.[317] While a rising birth rate is contributing to population growth, it remains considerably below the baby boom peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964,[318] or the high of 6.02 children born per woman in 1815,[319] below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63.[320] In 2011, 47.3 per cent of births in the UK were to unmarried women.[321] The Office for National Statistics reported in 2015 that out of the UK population aged 16 and over, 1.7 per cent identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (2.0 per cent of males and 1.5 per cent of females); 4.5 per cent of respondents responded with \"other\", \"I don't know\", or did not respond.[322] The number of transgender people in the UK was estimated to be between 65,000 and 300,000 by research between 2001 and 2008.[323]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom(England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area;[324] Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement;[325] Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area)[326]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Urban area |  Pop. | Principal settlement | Rank | Urban area |  Pop. | Principal settlement |\n| 1 | **Greater London** | 9,787,426 | London | 11 | **Bristol** | 617,280 | Bristol |\n| 2 | **Greater Manchester** | 2,553,379 | Manchester | 12 | **Edinburgh** | 512,150 | Edinburgh |\n| 3 | **West Midlands** | 2,440,986 | Birmingham | 13 | **Leicester** | 508,916 | Leicester |\n| 4 | **West Yorkshire** | 1,777,934 | Leeds | 14 | **Belfast** | 483,418 | Belfast |\n| 5 | **Greater Glasgow** | 985,290 | Glasgow | 15 |  **Brighton & Hove** | 474,485 | Brighton |\n| 6 | **Liverpool** | 864,122 | Liverpool | 16 |  **South East Dorset** | 466,266 | Bournemouth |\n| 7 | **South Hampshire** | 855,569 | Southampton | 17 |  **Cardiff** | 390,214 | Cardiff |\n| 8 | **Tyneside** | 774,891 | Newcastle upon Tyne | 18 | **Teesside** | 376,633 | Middlesbrough |\n| 9 | **Nottingham** | 729,977 | Nottingham | 19 | **Stoke-on-Trent** | 372,775 | Stoke-on-Trent |\n| 10 | **Sheffield** | 685,368 | Sheffield | 20 |  **Coventry** | 359,262 | Coventry |\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom\n\nHistorically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 12th century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans. Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK.[327] The UK has a history of non-white immigration with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade. During this period it is estimated the Afro-Caribbean population of Great Britain was 10,000 to 15,000[328] which later declined due to the abolition of slavery.[329] The UK also has the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century.[330] In 2011[update], 87.2 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 12.8 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of an ethnic minority group.[331]\n\n\nEthnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. 30.4 per cent of London's population and 37.4 per cent of Leicester's was estimated to be non-white in 2005[update],[332] whereas less than 5 per cent of the populations of North East England, Wales and the South West were from ethnic minorities, according to the 2001 census.[333] In 2016[update], 31.4 per cent of primary and 27.9 per cent of secondary pupils at state schools in England were members of an ethnic minority.[334]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the United Kingdom\n\nThe English language is the official and most spoken language of the United Kingdom that originated from England.[335][336] The United Kingdom proactively promotes the language globally to build connections, understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries worldwide.[337][338] It is estimated that 95 per cent of the UK's population are monolingual English speakers.[339] 5.5 per cent of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent immigration.[339] South Asian languages are the largest grouping which includes Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali, Sylheti, Hindi and Gujarati.[340] According to the 2011 census, Polish has become the second-largest language spoken in England and has 546,000 speakers.[341] In 2019, some three-quarters of a million people spoke little or no English.[342]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bilingual sign (Irish and English) in Newry, Northern Ireland\nThree indigenous Celtic languages are spoken in the UK: Welsh, Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Cornish, which became extinct as a first language in the late 18th century, is subject to revival efforts and has a small group of second language speakers.[343][2] According to the 2021 census, the Welsh-speaking population of Wales aged three or older was 538,300 people (17.8 per cent).[344] In addition, it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England.[345] In the 2011 census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people (10.4 per cent) stated that they had \"some knowledge of Irish\" (see Irish language in Northern Ireland), almost exclusively in the nationalist (mainly Catholic) population. Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2 per cent of the population) had some Gaelic language ability, including 72 per cent of those living in the Outer Hebrides.[346] The number of children being taught either Welsh or Scottish Gaelic is increasing.[347] Scots, a language descended from early northern Middle English, has limited recognition alongside its regional variant, Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland, without specific commitments to protection and promotion.[2][348] As of April 2020, there are said to be around 151,000 users of British Sign Language (BSL), a sign language used by deaf people, in the UK.[349]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in the United Kingdom\n\nReligion in the United Kingdom (2018 research)[350]\n\n\n\nNone (52%)\nChurch of England (13.7%)\nCatholic Church (8.7%)\nOther Christian (13.2%)\nIslam (6.7%)\nOther religions (3.6%)\nNot stated (2.1%)\n\nForms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for more than 1,400 years.[351] Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in many surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century,[352] while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths, most notably Islam.[353] This has led some commentators to variously describe the UK as a multi-faith,[354] secularised,[355] or post-Christian society.[356]\n\n\nIn the 2001 census, 71.6 per cent of all respondents indicated that they were Christians, with the next largest faiths being Islam (2.8 per cent), Hinduism (1.0 per cent), Sikhism (0.6 per cent), Judaism (0.5 per cent), Buddhism (0.3 per cent) and all other religions (0.3 per cent).[357] Of the respondents, 15 per cent stated that they had no religion and a further 7 per cent did not state a religious preference.[358] A Tearfund survey in 2007 showed that only one in ten Britons actually attend church weekly.[359] Between the 2001 and 2011 census, there was a 12 per cent decrease in the number of people who identified as Christian, while the percentage of those reporting no religious affiliation doubled. This contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories, with the number of Muslims increasing by the most substantial margin to a total of about 5 per cent.[360] The Muslim population has increased from 1.6 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2011, making it the second-largest religious group in the UK.[361]\n\n\nThe Church of England is the established church in England.[362] It retains a representation in the UK Parliament, and the British monarch is its Supreme Governor.[363] In Scotland, the Church of Scotland is recognised as the national church. It is not subject to state control, and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to \"maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government\" upon his or her accession.[364][2][365] The Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and, because the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of Ireland, there is no established church in Northern Ireland.[366] Although there are no UK-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, it has been estimated that 62 per cent of Christians are Anglican, 13.5 per cent Catholic, 6 per cent Presbyterian, and 3.4 per cent Methodist, with small numbers of other Protestant denominations such as Plymouth Brethren, and Orthodox churches.[367]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Historical immigration to Great Britain and Modern immigration to the United Kingdom\n\nSee also: Foreign-born population of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Estimated foreign-born population by country of birth from April 2007 to March 2008\n![](image)Estimated number of British citizens living overseas by country in 2006\nImmigration is now contributing to a rising UK population,[368] with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. According to official statistics released in 2015, 27 per cent of UK live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK.[369] The ONS reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 per cent to 239,000.[370]\n\n\nIn 2013, approximately 208,000 foreign nationals were naturalised as British citizens, the highest number since 1962. This figure fell to around 125,800 in 2014. Between 2009 and 2013, the average number of British citizenships granted annually was 195,800. The most common previous nationalities of those naturalised in 2014 were Indian, Pakistani, Filipino, Nigerian, Bangladeshi, Nepali, Chinese, South African, Polish and Somali.[371] The total number of grants of settlement, which confer permanent residence in the UK but not citizenship,[372] was approximately 154,700 in 2013, higher than the previous two years.[371]\n\n\nEmigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century. Between 1815 and 1930, around 11.4 million people emigrated from Britain and 7.3 million from Ireland. Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century, some 300 million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled around the globe.[373] Today, at least 5.5 million UK-born people live abroad,[374][375] mainly in Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada.[374][376]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United Kingdom and Universities in the United Kingdom\n\nFurther information: Education in England, Education in Scotland, Education in Wales, and Education in Northern Ireland\n\n![](image)University of Oxford is widely regarded as one of the world's leading universities.\nEducation in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system. About 38 per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree, which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world.[377] The United Kingdom is home to many universities, including the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge which often achieve first place on global rankings.[378][379]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 13th in the world in reading, literacy, mathematics, and science. The average British student scored 503.7, well above the OECD average of 493.[380]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in the United Kingdom\nFurther information: Healthcare in England, Healthcare in Scotland, and Healthcare in Wales\n![](image)NHS Scotland's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, the largest hospital campus in Europe\nThe modern-system of universal publicly funded in the United Kingdom has its origins in the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1949 which still exists to this day and is the primary healthcare provider in the United Kingdom. The widespread popularity of the NHS has led to it being described as a \"national religion\".[381][382] Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each country has its own system of universal publicly funded healthcare, although private healthcare is also available. Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The World Health Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.[383]\n\n\nSince 1979, expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly.[384] The 2018 OECD data, which incorporates in health a chunk of what in the UK is classified as social care, has the UK spending £3,121 per head.[385] In 2017 the UK spent £2,989 per person on healthcare, around the median for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.[386]\n\n\nRegulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges. Political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national executives; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Government. Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts.[387]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of the United Kingdom\n\nThe culture of the United Kingdom is influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history; and being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. As a result of the British Empire, British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies, in particular, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland, a common culture known today as the Anglosphere.[388][389] The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led to it being described as a \"cultural superpower\".[110][111] A global opinion poll for the BBC saw the United Kingdom ranked the third most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany and Canada) in 2013 and 2014.[390]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British literature\n\n![](image)William Shakespeare's First Folio from 1623; a copy is on display in the British Library.\nBritish literature includes literature associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Most British literature is in English. In 2005, some 206,000 books were published in the United Kingdom and in 2006 it was the largest publisher of books in the world.[391]\n\n\nThe English playwright and poet William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time.[392] The 20th-century English crime writer Agatha Christie is the best-selling novelist of all time.[393] Twelve of the top 25 of 100 novels by British writers chosen by a BBC poll of global critics were written by women; these included works by George Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Mary Shelley, Jane Austen, Doris Lessing and Zadie Smith.[394]\n\n\nScotland's contributions include Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes), Sir Walter Scott, J. M. Barrie, Robert Louis Stevenson and the poet Robert Burns. More recently Hugh MacDiarmid and Neil M. Gunn contributed to the Scottish Renaissance, with grimmer works from Ian Rankin and Iain Banks. Scotland's capital, Edinburgh, was UNESCO's first worldwide City of Literature.[395]\n\n\nWelsh literature includes Britain's oldest known poem, *Y Gododdin*, which was composed most likely in the late 6th century. It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the earliest known reference to King Arthur.[396] The Arthurian legend was further developed by Geoffrey of Monmouth.[397] Poet Dafydd ap Gwilym (*fl.* 1320–1370) is regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age.[398] Daniel Owen is credited as the first Welsh-language novelist, publishing *Rhys Lewis* in 1885. The best-known of the Anglo-Welsh poets are Dylan Thomas and R. S. Thomas, the latter nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996. Leading Welsh novelists of the twentieth century include Richard Llewellyn and Kate Roberts.[399][400]\n\n\nIrish writers, living at a time when all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, include Oscar Wilde,[401] Bram Stoker[402] and George Bernard Shaw.[403] There have been many authors whose origins were from outside the United Kingdom but who moved to the UK, including Joseph Conrad,[404] T. S. Eliot,[405] Kazuo Ishiguro,[406] Sir Salman Rushdie[407] and Ezra Pound.[408]\n\n\n\n### Philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British philosophy\n\nThe United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of 'British Empiricism', a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the 'Scottish School of Common Sense'.[409] The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke, George Berkeley[r] and David Hume; while Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major exponents of the Scottish \"common sense\" school. Two Britons are also notable for the ethical theory of utilitarianism, a moral philosophy first used by Jeremy Bentham and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work *Utilitarianism*.[410]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)The Proms is a classical music festival held at the Royal Albert Hall which regularly plays music by Edward Elgar and Henry Wood.\nVarious styles of music have become popular in the UK, including the indigenous folk music of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Historically, there has been exceptional Renaissance music from the Tudor period, with masses, madrigals and lute music by Thomas Tallis, John Taverner, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons and John Dowland. After the Stuart Restoration, an English tradition of dramatic masques, anthems and airs became established, led by Henry Purcell, followed by Thomas Arne and others. The German-born composer George Frideric Handel became a naturalised British citizen in 1727, when he composed the anthem *Zadok the Priest* for the coronation of George II; it became the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs. Handel's many oratorios, such as his famous *Messiah*, were written in the English language.[411] In the second half of the 19th century, as Arthur Sullivan and his librettist W. S. Gilbert wrote their popular Savoy operas, Edward Elgar's wide range of music rivalled that of his contemporaries on the continent. Increasingly, however, composers became inspired by the English countryside and its folk music, notably Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Benjamin Britten, a pioneer of modern British opera. Among the many post-war composers, some of the most notable have made their own personal choice of musical identity: Peter Maxwell Davies (Orkney), Harrison Birtwistle (mythological), and John Tavener (religious).[412]\n\n\nAccording to *The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians*, the term \"pop music\" originated in Britain in the mid-1950s to describe rock and roll's fusion with the \"new youth music\".[413] *The Oxford Dictionary of Music* states that artists such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones drove pop music to the forefront of popular music in the early 1960s.[414] Birmingham became known as the birthplace of heavy metal, with the band Black Sabbath starting there in the 1960s.[415] In the following years, Britain widely occupied a part in the development of rock music, with British acts pioneering hard rock;[416] raga rock; heavy metal;[417] space rock; glam rock;[418] Gothic rock,[419] psychedelic rock,[420] and punk rock.[421] British acts also developed neo soul and created dubstep.[422] The modern UK is known to produce some of the most prominent English-speaking rappers along with the United States, including Stormzy, Kano, Yxng Bane, Ramz, Little Simz and Skepta.[423]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Beatles are the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in popular music, selling over a billion records.[424][425][426]\nThe Beatles have international sales of over 1 billion units and are the biggest-selling and most influential band in the history of popular music.[424][425][426][427] Other prominent British contributors to have influenced popular music over the last 50 years include the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zeppelin, the Bee Gees, and Elton John, all of whom have worldwide record sales of 200 million or more.[428] The Brit Awards are the BPI's annual music awards, and some of the British recipients of the Outstanding Contribution to Music award include the Who, David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, the Police, and Fleetwood Mac (who are a British-American band).[429] More recent UK music acts that have had international success include George Michael, Oasis, Spice Girls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, Robbie Williams, Amy Winehouse, Susan Boyle, Adele, Ed Sheeran, Lewis Capaldi, One Direction and Harry Styles.[430]\n\n\nA number of UK cities are known for their music. Acts from Liverpool have had 54 UK chart number 1 hit singles, more per capita than any other city worldwide.[431] Glasgow's contribution to music was recognised in 2008 when it was named a UNESCO City of Music.[432] Manchester played a role in the spread of dance music such as acid house, and from the mid-1990s, Britpop. London and Bristol are closely associated with the origins of electronic music sub-genres such as drum and bass and trip hop.[433] Influential UK dance acts include the Prodigy, Underworld, Leftfield, Basement Jaxx, Chemical Brothers, Sub Focus, Chase & Status and Calvin Harris.\n\n\n\n### Visual art[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Art of the United Kingdom and Architecture of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)William Morris textile design, 1883\n![](image)The Angel of the North sculpture by Antony Gormley has become a symbol of northern England.\nMajor British artists include: the Romantics William Blake, John Constable, Samuel Palmer and J. M. W. Turner; the portrait painters Sir Joshua Reynolds and Lucian Freud; the landscape artists Thomas Gainsborough and L. S. Lowry; the pioneer of the Arts and Crafts Movement William Morris; the figurative painter Francis Bacon; the Pop artists Peter Blake, Richard Hamilton and David Hockney; the pioneers of Conceptual art movement Art & Language;[434] the collaborative duo Gilbert and George; the abstract artist Howard Hodgkin; and the sculptors Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Henry Moore. During the late 1980s and 1990s the Saatchi Gallery in London helped to bring to public attention a group of multi-genre artists who would become known as the \"Young British Artists\": Damien Hirst, Chris Ofili, Rachel Whiteread, Tracey Emin, Mark Wallinger, Steve McQueen, Sam Taylor-Wood and the Chapman Brothers are among the better-known members of this loosely affiliated movement.\n\n\nThe Royal Academy in London is a key organisation for the promotion of the visual arts in the United Kingdom. Major schools of art in the UK include: the six-school University of the Arts London, which includes the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and Chelsea College of Art and Design; Goldsmiths, University of London; the Slade School of Fine Art (part of University College London); the Glasgow School of Art; the Royal College of Art; and The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art (part of the University of Oxford). The Courtauld Institute of Art is a leading centre for the teaching of the history of art. Important art galleries in the United Kingdom include the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain and Tate Modern (the most-visited modern art gallery in the world, with around 4.7 million visitors per year).[435]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cinema of the United Kingdom and Theatre of the United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema. The British directors Alfred Hitchcock, whose film *Vertigo* is considered by some critics as the best film of all time,[436] and David Lean are among the most critically acclaimed of all time.[437] Many British actors have achieved international fame and critical success. Some of the most commercially successful films of all time have been produced in the United Kingdom, including two of the highest-grossing film franchises (*Harry Potter* and *James Bond*).[438]\n\n\nIn 2009, British films grossed around $2 billion worldwide and achieved a market share of around 7 per cent globally and 17 per cent in the United Kingdom.[439] UK box-office takings totalled £944 million in 2009, with around 173 million admissions.[439] The annual British Academy Film Awards are hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[440]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British cuisine\n\nFurther information: English cuisine, Northern Irish cuisine, Scottish cuisine, and Welsh cuisine\n\n![](image)Fish and chips, a traditional British dish served with lemon, tartar sauce and mushy peas\nBritish cuisine developed from various influences reflective of its land, settlements, arrivals of new settlers and immigrants, trade and colonialism. The British Empire facilitated a knowledge of Indian cuisine with its \"strong, penetrating spices and herbs\". British cuisine has absorbed the cultural influence of those who have settled in Britain, producing hybrid dishes, such as chicken tikka masala.[441] The British have embraced world cuisine and regularly eat recipes or fast food from Europe, the Caribbean and Asia. Afternoon tea is a light afternoon meal served with tea in tea rooms and hotels around the United Kingdom, with the tradition dating back to around 1840.[442]\n\n\nA 2019 YouGov poll rated classic British food, the following had more than 80% of people like them who had tried them: Sunday roast, Yorkshire pudding, Fish and chips, Crumpets, and Full English breakfast.[443] Sweet foods are common within British cuisine, and there is a long list of British desserts.\n\n\nVegan and vegetarian diets have increased in Britain in recent years. In 2021, a survey found that 8% of British respondents eat a plant-based diet and 36% of respondents have a favourable view of plant-based diets.[444]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester is one of the largest media production facilities in Europe.\nThe BBC, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world.[445][446][447] It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television licence.[448] The BBC World Service is an international broadcaster owned and operated by the BBC. It is the world's largest of any kind.[449] It broadcasts radio news, speech and discussions in more than 40 languages.[450]\n\n\nOther major players in the UK media include ITV, which operates 11 of the 15 regional television broadcasters that make up the ITV Network,[451] and Sky.[452] Newspapers produced in the United Kingdom include the *Daily Mail*, *The Guardian*, *The Telegraph*, *The Times*, and the *Financial Times*.[453] Magazines and journals published in the United Kingdom that have achieved worldwide circulation include *The Spectator*, *The Economist*, *New Statesman*, and *Radio Times.*\n\n\nLondon dominates the media sector in the UK: national newspapers and television and radio are largely based there, although MediaCityUK in Manchester is also a significant national media centre. Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Cardiff, are important centres of newspaper and broadcasting production in Scotland and Wales, respectively.[454] The UK publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover of around £20 billion and employs around 167,000 people.[455] In 2015, the UK published 2,710 book titles per million inhabitants, more than any other country, much of this being exported to other Anglophone countries.[456]\n\n\nIn 2010, 82.5 per cent of the UK population were Internet users, the highest proportion among the 20 countries with the largest total number of users in that year.[457] The British video game industry is the largest in Europe, and, since 2022, the UK has the largest video game market in Europe by sales, overtaking Germany.[458] It is the world's third-largest producer of video games after Japan and the United States.[459]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sport in the United Kingdom and Great Britain at the Olympics\n\n![](image)Golf originated from the Old Course at St Andrews in Scotland.\nAssociation football, tennis, table tennis, badminton, rugby union, rugby league, rugby sevens, golf, boxing, netball, water polo, field hockey, billiards, darts, rowing, rounders and cricket originated or were substantially developed in the UK, with the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in late 19th-century Victorian Britain.[s]\n\n\nA 2003 poll found that football is the most popular sport in the UK.[462] England is recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football, and the Football Association is the oldest of its kind, with the rules of football first drafted in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley.[463] Each of the Home Nations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) has its own football association, national team and league system, and each is individually a governing member of the International Football Association Board alongside FIFA. The English top division, the Premier League, is the most watched football league in the world.[464] The first international football match was contested by England and Scotland on 30 November 1872.[465] England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland usually compete as separate countries in international competitions.[466]\n\n\nIn 2003, rugby union was ranked the second most popular sport in the UK.[462] The sport was created in Rugby School, Warwickshire, and the first rugby international took place on 27 March 1871 between England and Scotland.[467][468] England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy compete in the Six Nations Championship, which is the premier international rugby union tournament in the northern hemisphere. Sports governing bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland organise and regulate the game separately.[469] Every four years, the Home Nations make a combined team known as the British and Irish Lions which tours Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.\n\n\nThe United Kingdom hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1908, 1948 and 2012, with London acting as the host city on all three occasions. Birmingham hosted the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the seventh time a constitute country in the United Kingdom hosted the Commonwealth Games (England, Scotland and Wales have each hosted the Commonwealth Games at least once).[470]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Symbols of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Union Jack flags on The Mall, London\nThe flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag (also referred to as the Union Jack).[471] It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the flag of England, representing Saint George, on the flag of Scotland, representing Saint Andrew, and was updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag.[472] Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out.[473] The national anthem of the United Kingdom is \"God Save the King\", with \"King\" replaced with \"Queen\" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman.\n\n\nBritannia is a national personification of the United Kingdom, originating from Roman Britain.[474] Beside The Lion and the Unicorn and the dragon of heraldry, the bulldog is an iconic animal and commonly represented with the Union Flag.[475] A now rare personification is a character originating in the 18th century, John Bull.[476]\n\n\nEngland, Wales, and Scotland each have a number of their own national symbols, including their national flags. Northern Ireland also has a number of symbols, many of which are shared with Republic of Ireland.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n* ![flag](image)England portal\n* ![icon](image)Northern Ireland portal\n* ![flag](image)Scotland portal\n* ![flag](image)Wales portal\n\n\n* Outline of the United Kingdom\n\t+ Outline of England\n\t+ Outline of Northern Ireland\n\t+ Outline of Scotland\n\t+ Outline of Wales\n* Index of United Kingdom-related articles\n* International rankings of the United Kingdom\n* Historiography of the United Kingdom\n* Historiography of the British Empire\n* United Kingdom–Crown Dependencies Customs Union\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** There is no authorised version of the national anthem as the words are a matter of tradition; only the first verse is usually sung.[1] No statute has been enacted designating \"God Save the King\" as the official anthem. In the English tradition, such laws are not necessary; proclamation and usage are sufficient to make it the national anthem. \"God Save the King\" also serves as the Royal anthem for certain Commonwealth realms. The words *King, he, him, his*, used at present, are replaced by *Queen, she, her* when the monarch is female.\n2. **^** Scots, Ulster Scots, Welsh, Cornish, Scottish Gaelic and Irish are classed as regional or minority languages under the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.[2] These include defined obligations to promote those languages.[3] See also Languages of the United Kingdom. Welsh has limited *de jure* official status in Wales, as well as in the provision of national government services provided for Wales.\n3. **^** \"This category could include Polish responses from the country specific question for Scotland which would have been outputted to 'Other White' and then included under 'White' for UK. 'White Africans' may also have been recorded under 'Other White' and then included under 'White' for UK.\"\n4. **^** 83.6% are White British/Irish.\n5. **^** Although the United Kingdom has traditionally been seen as a unitary state, an alternative description of the UK as a \"union state\", put forward by, among others, Vernon Bogdanor,[4] has become increasingly influential since the adoption of devolution in the 1990s.[5] A union state is considered to differ from a unitary state in that while it maintains a central authority it also recognises the authority of historic rights and infrastructures of its component parts.[6]\n6. **^** Some of the devolved countries, Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories issue their own sterling banknotes or currencies, or use another nation's currency.

The *Guardian* and *Telegraph* use Britain as a synonym for the United Kingdom. Some prefer to use Britain as shorthand for Great Britain. The British Cabinet Office's Government Digital Service style guide for use on gov.uk recommends: \"Use UK and United Kingdom in preference to Britain and British (UK business, UK foreign policy, ambassador and high commissioner). But British embassy, not UK embassy.\"\n12. **^** The phrase \"countries within a country\" is sometimes used to describe the United Kingdom.\n13. **^** The 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty resolved the Irish War of Independence. When it took effect one year later, it established the Irish Free State as a separate dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations. In 1927 the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 changed the name of the UK to reflect this.\n14. **^** The United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution but an unwritten one formed of Acts of Parliament, court judgments, traditions, and conventions.[24]\n15. **^** Compare to section 1 of both of the 1800 Acts of Union which reads: the *Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland shall...be united into one Kingdom, by the Name of \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\"*.\n16. **^** British sovereignty derives from the Crown, a corporation sole occupied by the monarch. It is therefore by and through the monarch that Parliament exercises supreme legislative authority over both the executive and judiciary. Distinguished Professor of Public Law Maurice Sunkin opined the Crown symbolically occupies \"…what in other places would be a core element of a written constitution.\"[163] As a result of this state of constitutional affairs, the monarch is formally referred to as \"the Sovereign\" in legislation.[164]\n17. **^** For instance, the monarch alone appoints the prime minister and confers state honours in the personal gift of the Crown. When necessary, the monarch may also refuse a dissolution or prorogation of Parliament, withhold royal assent to primary legislation, and prevent illegal use of the British Armed Forces, among other reserve powers.[171]\n18. **^** Berkeley is in fact Irish but was called a 'British empiricist' due to the territory of what is now known as the Republic of Ireland being in the UK at the time.\n19. **^** In 2012, the President of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, stated, \"This great, sports-loving country is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern sport. It was here that the concepts of sportsmanship and fair play were first codified into clear rules and regulations. It was here that sport was included as an educational tool in the school curriculum\".[460][461]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Berry, Ciara (15 January 2016). \"National Anthem\".

Existing differences and some social and health matters are exempted but these are much less extensive than the exemptions permitted under the EU Internal Market provisions. Only after an amendment in the House of Lords, the Bill was amended to provide a weak and non-binding consent mechanism for amendments (equivalent to the Sewel Convention) to the list of exemptions. The result is that, while the devolved governments retain regulatory competences, these are undermined by the fact that goods and services originating in, or imported into, England can be marketed anywhere.\n196. **^** Kenny, Michael; McEwen, Nicola (1 March 2021). \"Intergovernmental Relations and the Crisis of the Union\". *Political Insight*. **12** (1).

Taken as a whole, the Internal Market Act imposes greater restrictions upon the competences of the devolved institutions than the provisions of the EU Single Market which it replaced, in spite of pledges to use common frameworks to address these issues. Lord Hope, responsible for many of the leading judgments relating to the first two decades of devolution, regarded the legislation's terms as deliberately confrontational: 'this Parliament can do what it likes, but a different approach is essential if the union is to hold together'.\n199. **^** Dougan, Michael; Hayward, Katy; Hunt, Jo; McEwen, Nicola; McHarg, Aileen; Wincott, Daniel (2020).

The Act has restrictive – and potentially damaging – consequences for the regulatory capacity of the devolved legislatures...This was not the first time since the Brexit referendum that the Convention had been set aside, but it was especially notable given that the primary purpose of the legislation was to constrain the capacity of the devolved institutions to use their regulatory autonomy...in practice, it constrains the ability of the devolved institutions to make effective regulatory choices for their territories in ways that do not apply to the choices made by the UK government and parliament for the English market.\n202. ^ ***a*** ***b*** [195][196][197][198][199][200][201]\n203. **^** \"Structure and powers of the Assembly\". *BBC News*. 9 April 1999.

The UK Parliament is sovereign and the Scottish Parliament is subordinate. The White Paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation. The Scottish Parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of Scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority. Following the logic of this argument, the power of the Scottish Parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden...; Elliot, M. (2004). \"United Kingdom: Parliamentary sovereignty under pressure\". *International Journal of Constitutional Law*. **2** (3): 545–627, 553–554. doi:10.1093/icon/2.3.545. Notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes, an important common factor is that the UK Parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned. For example, the Scottish Parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters, save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied ... but this power to legislate on what may be termed \"devolved matters\" is concurrent with the Westminster Parliament's general power to legislate for Scotland on any matter at all, including devolved matters ... In theory, therefore, Westminster may legislate on Scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses...\n206. **^** Gamble, A.

The British parliament has the power to abolish the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses, but since both were sanctioned by referenda, it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people. In this way, several of the constitutional measures introduced by the Blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster.\n207. **^** Meehan, E.

[T]he distinctive involvement of two governments in the Northern Irish problem means that Northern Ireland's new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement. If this can be equated with a treaty, it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between Westminster and Belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states...Although the Agreement makes the general proviso that Westminster's 'powers to make legislation for Northern Ireland' remains 'unaffected', without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters, it may be more difficult than in Scotland or Wales for devolved powers to be repatriated. The retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in Northern Ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement.\n208. **^** May, Theresa (29 March 2017). \"Prime Minister's letter to Donald Tusk triggering Article 50\" – via Gov.uk.\n209. **^** Swaine, Jon (13 January 2009). \"Barack Obama presidency will strengthen special relationship, says Gordon Brown\". *The Telegraph*.

It is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery (primarily of Africans) led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. However, racial discrimination and inequality continued into subsequent centuries. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon, notably with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n\n\nThe United States government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been extensively shaped by the world's largest immigrant population.\n\n\nHighly developed, the U.S. has by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by nominal GDP. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter, as well as the largest consumer market. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of the United States and Demonyms for the United States\n\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[28][29][30] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in *The Virginia Gazette* newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[31]\n\n\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[32][33] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of United States history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)Cliff Palace, located in present-day Colorado, was built by Ancestral Puebloans.\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000BC, is believed to represent the first widespread culture in the Americas.[37][38] The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward.[39]\n\n\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in present-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region in present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Algonquian were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. Before European immigrants made contact, most of the Algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the \"Three Sisters\". By the time of European contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands' productivity and manage land.[43][44][45][46][47][48] The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[49] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[50] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants[51][52] range from around 500,000[53][51] to nearly 10 million.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Colonization (1492–1763)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial history of the United States\n\n![](image)British North America in 1775 with the 13 colonies shown in red\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, and Spain soon established Spanish Florida on the mainland.[54][55] \nThe Spanish Empire set up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in Saint Augustine (1565), which is often considered the nation's oldest city,[56] and Santa Fe (1598). The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in the present-day New York Bay region.[57] The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New Orleans (1718) and Mobile (1702).[58]\nBritish colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[59][60] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England seeking religious freedom.[61] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[62][63]\n\n\nDuring 17th-century European colonization, settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, particularly in King Philip's War, but often came to develop a mutual dependency. Settlers traded guns, tools, and European goods for food and animal pelts.[64] Native Americans taught settlers to cultivate local foods. Colonial authorities often pursued policies to to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urge or force them to adopt European lifestyles.[65][66] The native population of America declined after European arrival,[67][68][69] primarily as a result of infectious diseases brought from Europe such as smallpox and measles,[70][71] and native peoples were displaced by European expansion.[72]\n\n\nEuropean settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.[73] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the Southern Colonies.[74] Southern tobacco colonies passed laws designed to keep African Americans subservient.[75][76][77]\n\n\nThe original Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered by Great Britain.[78] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some areas, Catholics.[79][80] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[81] By the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[82] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance, [83] and the First Great Awakening—a series of Christian revivals—fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[84]\n\n\n\n### Revolution and the new nation (1763–1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1776–1789)\n\nFurther information: American Enlightenment\n\n![See caption](image)*Declaration of Independence*, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia\nAfter the British victory in the French and Indian War, won largely through the support from the colonies, the British began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. In 1774, to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the British government that extracted taxes from them, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The British attempted to disarm the Americans, resulting in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and charged a committee led by Thomas Jefferson with writing a Declaration of Independence.[85]\n\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.[86] After the surrender of a second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day Canada in the north to Florida in the south.[87] Washington resigned his commission, returned to private life, and the Continental Army was disbanded. \n\n\n\n![](image)*The Old Plantation*, a c. 1790 painting of a plantation by a South Carolina slaveholder\nRatified by the states in 1781 and based on the concept of \"consent of the governed\", the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[86] Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,[88] the Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states.[89] The prohibition of slavery in the Northwest Territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as an extension of the Mason–Dixon line, the geographic and political divide between slave states and free states.[90][91]\n\n\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was drafted. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[92] Ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789, reorganizing the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington was elected the nation's first President under the new constitution and returned to public life. The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by sceptics of the more centralized national government.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### Expansion (1789–1860)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1789–1849)\n ![](image)Animated map of the territorial evolution of the United States (click to view full size image)\nDuring the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies. However, during the American Revolution, many began to question the practice.[95] Founding Fathers in the northern United States advocated for the abolition of slavery, and slavery was abolished in Northern states.[96] The increased profitability for southern elites after the cotton gin lowered production costs entrenched support for slavery in the southern United States.[97][98][99]\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, with a sense of manifest destiny.[100] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) nearly doubled the territory of the United States, and effectively ended French opposition to America's westward expansion.[101] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a virtual draw but established the United States as capable of defending itself.[102] Spain ceded Florida and their Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[103] The Missouri Compromise (1820) admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, dividing the country into free states, which forbade slavery, and slave states, which protected the institution.[104] [105]\n\n\nAs Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[106][107] The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River.[108][109] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[105] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[110] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, resulting in the U.S. stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.[100][111]\n\n\n\n### Civil War and Reconstruction (1860–1876)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1849–1865) and 1865–1918\n\n![](image)Division of the states during the American Civil War\n * Union states\n* Border states\n* Confederate states\n* Territories\nSectional conflict regarding slavery[112] culminated in the American Civil War.[113] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states (the Union) maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[114] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston, South Carolina. The ensuing Civil War (1861–1865) became the deadliest military conflict in American history.[115] In 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor following the Siege of Vicksburg led by General Ulysses S. Grant, which gave them control of the Mississippi River, and the Battle of Gettysburg, where the Union Army halted Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered.[116]\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Chinese railroad workers on the Central Pacific Railroad, 1870\nThe Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Radical Republicans passed the Reconstruction Amendments to ensure the rights of African Americans. The biracial Southern governments were opposed by terrorist and paramilitary organizations. To encourage additional westward settlement the Homestead Acts allowed an applicant to acquire ownership of government land, by residing there. More than 160 million acres (650 thousand km2; 250 thousand sq mi)—nearly 10 percent of the total area of the United States—were given away free to 1.6 million homesteaders. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 was enacted to break a cycle of debt during Reconstruction. This act attempted to sell land at low prices so marginalized Southerners could buy it, but many were still too poor to afford the lower prices.[117] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred growth in the American Old West. New transcontinental railways made relocation easier, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[118]\n\n\n\n### Development of the modern United States (1876–1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1865–1918)\n\n![](image)An October 24th, 1874 Harper's Magazine editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast denouncing Ku Klux Klan and White League murders of African Americans\nThe Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[119][120] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[121] From 1890 to 1910, the Southern States established Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all African Americans. Racial segregation was prevalent nationwide and discrimination was codified, especially in the South,[122] while well into the 20th century lynching and other forms of unjustified vigilante violence often went unprosecuted.[123][124]\n\n\nTerritorial expansion continued apace. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[125] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish–American War.[126] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but through the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917,[127] allowing for the conscription of 20,000 Puerto Ricans, which began two months later.[128] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[129] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[130]\n\n\n\nAn Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[131][132]\nFrom 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe including Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Russia, and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.[133] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892 specifically through the now iconic Ellis Island. New York and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[134] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[135]\n\n\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[136] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[137] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[138][139][140] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[141]\n\n\n\n### World Wars period (1914–1945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1918–1945)\n\n![](image)The Trinity nuclear test in the Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945, part of the Manhattan Project and the first detonation of a nuclear weapon\nThe early 20th century was a time of industrial expansion and social change in the United States.[142][143] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[144] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[145] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the United States.[146] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[147][148]\n\n\nAt first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[149][150] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them again the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[151][152] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[153][154] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.[155]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary United States (1945–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), 1964–1980, 1980–1991, and 1991–2008\n\n![See caption](image)Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.\nAfter World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate the affairs of other countries.[156] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[157][158][159][160][161] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[162]\n\n\nThe civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[163] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable for recreational drug use, sexuality[164][165] and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in Vietnam.[166] The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, which led to a decline in public trust in government.[167]\n\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s saw economic stagflation and President Ronald Reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[168][169][170][171] By 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[172] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[173][174][175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Twin Towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks, 2001\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, the U.S. faced challenges from terrorism, with the September 11 attacks in 2001 leading to the war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[177][178] The U.S. housing bubble in 2006 culminated in the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[179] Amid the financial crisis, Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, was elected in 2008.[180][181]\n\n\nPolitical polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated political discussion.[182] The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 100 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths,[183] making it the most deadly pandemic in U.S. history.[184] Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election culminated in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power.[185]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the United States\n\n![](image)A topographic map of the United States\nThe United States is the world's third-largest nation by land and total area behind Russia and Canada.[c][186][187] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2).[188][189] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[190]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[191] The Mississippi River System—the world's fourth longest river system—runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[191]\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[192] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[193] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[194] about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[195] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[196] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[197]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Köppen climate types of the United States\nMain articles: Climate of the United States and Climate change in the United States\n\nWith its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[198] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[199]\n\n\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[200] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[201] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[202]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States\n\n![A bald eagle](image)The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States since 1782[203]\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[204] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[205] and 91,000 insect species.[206]\n\n\nThere are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[207] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[208] primarily in the western states.[209] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for industrial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[210][211]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biological diversity, logging and deforestation,[212][213] and climate change.[214][215] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[216] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[217] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[218] As of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[219] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[220]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Constitution of the United States, Politics of the United States, and Government of the United States\n\nFurther information: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, Political ideologies in the United States, American patriotism, and American civil religion\n\n![](image)The Capitol and its two legislative chambers, the Senate (left) and the House of Representatives (right)\n![](image)The White House, the residence and workplace of the U.S. President and the offices of the presidential staff\n![](image)The Supreme Court Building, which houses the nation's highest court\nThe United States was founded on the principles of the American Enlightenment. It is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[221][222] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and, according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[223] It is a liberal representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\"[224] The U.S. Constitution serves as the country's supreme legal document, establishing the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states.[225]\n\n\nThe federal government comprises three branches, which are headquartered in Washington, D.C. and regulated by a system of checks and balances.[226]\n\n\n\n* The U.S. Congress, a bicameral legislature, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[227] and has the power of impeachment.[228] The Senate has 100 members (2 from each state), elected for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members from single member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of population, elected for a two-year term.\n* The U.S. President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies through their respective agencies.[229] The president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election.[230] It is an indirect election, with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the Electoral College. The President and Vice President serve a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice.\n* The U.S. federal judiciary, whose judges are all appointed for life by the President with Senate approval, consists primarily of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[231] The Supreme Court is led by the chief justice of the United States. It has nine members who serve for life. The members are appointed by the sitting president when a vacancy becomes available.[232]\n\n\n### Political subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Political divisions of the United States, State government in the United States, Local government in the United States, and U.S. state\n\nFurther information: List of states and territories of the United States, Indian reservation, and Territories of the United States\n\nSee also: Territorial evolution of the United States\n\nIn the American federal system, sovereignty is shared between two levels of government: federal and state. Each of the 50 states has territory where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[233] The territories and the District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government.[234]\n\n![](image)\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States\n\n![see caption](image)The United Nations headquarters has been situated along the East River in Midtown Manhattan since 1952; in 1945, the United States was a founding member of the UN.\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019.[235] It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[236] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[237] The United States is a member of the G7,[238] G20,[239] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[240] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[241] North Korea,[242] and Bhutan.[243] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[244] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[245]\n\n\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[246] and strong ties with Canada,[247] Australia,[248] New Zealand,[249] the Philippines,[250] Japan,[251] South Korea,[252] Israel,[253] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[254] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[255] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[256] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[257] and its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[258][259] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine.[260][261]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Armed Forces and Military history of the United States\n\n![](image)The Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled America's large-scale manufacturing of consumer products in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[322] In 2022, the United States was the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers.[323] As of 2021, the U.S. ranked second by the number of patent applications, and third by trademark and industrial design applications.[324] In 2022, the United States ranked 3rd in the Global Innovation Index.[325]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], the United States receives approximately 79.1% of its energy from fossil fuels.[326] In 2021, the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (36.1%), followed by natural gas (32.2%), coal (10.8%), renewable sources (12.5%), and nuclear power (8.4%).[326] The United States constitutes less than 5% of the world's population, but consumes 17% of the world's energy.[327][328] The U.S. ranks as the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases.[329]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in the United States\n\n![](image)Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, is the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic with over 93 million passengers annually in 2022.[330]\nPersonal transportation in the United States is dominated by automobiles,[331][332] which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads, making it the longest network in the world.[333][334] The Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the Ford Model T, both American cars, are considered the first mass-produced[335] and mass-affordable[336] cars, respectively. As of 2022, the United States is the second-largest manufacturer of motor vehicles.[337] Currently, the American automotive industry is the world's second-largest automobile market by sales,[338] and the U.S. has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, [339] with 910 vehicles per 1000 people.[340] The United States's rail network, the longest in the world,[341] handles mostly freight.[342][343]\n\n\nThe American civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[344] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[345] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the top five and the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[346][347] As of 2020[update], there are 19,919 airports in the United States, of which 5,217 are designated as \"public use\", including for general aviation and other activities.[348]\n\n\nOf the fifty busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, of which the busiest is the Port of Los Angeles.[349] The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, and total 41,009 km (25,482 mi).[350]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of the United States\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Americans and Race and ethnicity in the United States\n\nSee also: List of U.S. states by population\n\n![](image)United States population density map based on Census 2010 data\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020,[m][351] making the United States the third-most populous nation in the world, after China and India.[352] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January 28, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[353] In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[354] In 2021, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.7 children per woman,[355] and it had the world's highest rate of children (23%) living in single-parent households in 2019.[356]\n\n\nThe United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[357] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa, form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population.[358][359] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the nation's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total United States population.[357] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population, while the country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%.[357] In 2020, the median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.[352]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the United States\n\n![](image)Most spoken languages in USA\nWhile many languages are spoken in the United States, English is overwhelmingly the most commonly spoken in a majority of the country.[360] Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English, and most states have declared English as the official language.[361] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[362] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[n][363] South Dakota (Sioux),[364] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[365]\n\n\nAccording to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[366]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to the United States\n\nAmerica's immigrant population, numbering more than 50 million, is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[367][368] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[369] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[370] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[371] The United States has led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[372]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligious affiliation in USA, per Gallup, Inc. (2022)[373]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (34%)\nCatholicism (23%)\nNon-specific Christian (11%)\nMormonism (2%)\nJudaism (2%)\nOther religions (6%)\nUnaffiliated (21%)\nNo answer (1%)\n\nMain articles: Religion in the United States and Irreligion in the United States\n\nSee also: List of religious movements that began in the United States\n\nThe First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.[374][375] Religious practice is widespread, among the most diverse in the world,[376] and vibrant, with the country being far more religious than other wealthy Western nations.[377] An overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power,[378] engage in spiritual practices such as prayer,[379] and consider themselves religious or spiritual.[380][381] The country has the world's largest Christian population.[382] A majority of the global Jewish population lives in the United States, as measured by the Law of Return.[383]\n\n\nA 2022 *Gallup* poll found that 31% reported \"attending a church, synagogue, mosque or temple weekly or nearly weekly\".[384] Religious practice varies significantly by region.[385] In the \"Bible Belt\", located within the Southern United States, evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally. New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious,[385] although Mormonism—a Restorationist Christian movement started in New York in the 19th century—is the predominant religious affiliation in Utah.[386]\n\n\nAround 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith.[387] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.[388] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[389] Religious belief and interest has remained relatively stable in recent years; organizational participation, in contrast, has decreased.[390] Other notable faiths include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, many New Age movements, and a large variety of Native American religions.[391]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population\n\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[186] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[392] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[393] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[394]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in the United States2023 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[395]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |  |\n| ![New York](image)New York![Los Angeles](image)Los Angeles | 1 | New York | Northeast | 19,498,249 | 11 | Boston | Northeast | 4,919,179\n | ![Chicago](image)Chicago![Dallas–Fort Worth](image)Dallas–Fort Worth |\n| 2 | Los Angeles | West | 12,799,100 | 12 | Riverside–San Bernardino | West | 4,688,053\n |\n| 3 | Chicago | Midwest | 9,262,825 | 13 | San Francisco | West | 4,566,961\n |\n| 4 | Dallas–Fort Worth | South | 8,100,037 | 14 | Detroit | Midwest | 4,342,304\n |\n| 5 | Houston | South | 7,510,253 | 15 | Seattle | West | 4,044,837\n |\n| 6 | Atlanta | South | 6,307,261 | 16 | Minneapolis–Saint Paul | Midwest | 3,712,020\n |\n| 7 | Washington, D.C. | South | 6,304,975 | 17 | Tampa–St. Petersburg | South | 3,342,963\n |\n| 8 | Philadelphia | Northeast | 6,246,160 | 18 | San Diego | West | 3,269,973\n |\n| 9 | Miami | South | 6,183,199 | 19 | Denver | West | 3,005,131\n |\n| 10 | Phoenix | West | 5,070,110 | 20 | Baltimore | South | 2,834,316\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Healthcare in the United States, Healthcare reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\n\n![The Texas Medical Center, a cluster of contemporary skyscrapers, at night](image)Texas Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, employing 106,000 people and treating 10 million patients annually as of 2016.[396]\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. The chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[397][398] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Black and American Indian–Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[399][400] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[401] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[402] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[403] Poverty is the 4th leading risk factor for premature death in the United States annually, according to a 2023 study published in *JAMA*.[404][405]\n\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations.[406] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[407]\n\n\nGovernment-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[o][408] with the law roughly halving the uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[409] Its legacy remains controversial.[410]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States\n\n![Photograph of the University of Virginia](image)The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of many public colleges and universities in the United States.\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[411] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[412] The basic literacy rate is near-universal.[186][413] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).[414][415]\n\n\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education including many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[416][417][418] There are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[419] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[420] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[421]\n\n\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[422] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[423] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[424] and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of 2022.[425]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of the United States and Society of the United States\n\n![The Statue of Liberty, a large teal bronze sculpture on a stone pedestal](image)The Statue of Liberty (*Liberty Enlightening the World*) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream.[426]\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[427][428] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[429][430] having a strong work ethic,[431] competitiveness,[432] and voluntary altruism towards others.[433][434][435] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.[436] Part of both the Anglosphere and Western World, the United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[437][438] and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale,[439][440] with the phenomenon being termed *Americanization*.[441] As such, the U.S. is considered a cultural superpower.[442]\n\n\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[443] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[437][444] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[437] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[445] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[446][447][448][449] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[450] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[451] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[452]\n\n\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[453] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[454][455][456] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[457] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[458] It is a socially progressive country[459] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[460] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world.[460][461][462]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American literature and American philosophy\n\n![Photograph of Mark Twain](image)Mark Twain, who William Faulkner called \"the father of American literature\"[463]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[464]\n\n\nAlmost until the 20th century pervasive anti-literacy laws prevented most people of color from learning to read or write.[465][466] In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated from the Southern United States and West Indies. Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the *négritude* philosophy.[467]\n\n\nSince its first use in the 19th century, the term \"Great American Novel\" has been applied to many books, including Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852), Twain's *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* (1925), John Steinbeck's *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939), Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1960), Toni Morrison's *Beloved* (1987), and David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* (1996).[468][469][470]\n\n\nThirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise Glück, Bob Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[471] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck have been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[472]\n\n\n\n### Mass media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mass media in the United States\n\nSee also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, Radio in the United States, and Video games in the United States\n\n![](image)Comcast Center in Philadelphia, headquarters of Comcast, the world's largest telecommunications and media conglomerate\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[473] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[474] As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[475] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[476]\n\n\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *USA Today*.[477] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[478][479] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as *The Village Voice* in New York City and *LA Weekly* in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[480]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the video game market of the United States is the world's largest by revenue.[481] Major video game publishers and developers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[482][483] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[484]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theater in the United States\n\n![](image)Broadway theatres in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City\nThe United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[485] In the 19th century, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[486]\n\n\nThe central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[487] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[488]\n\n\nAlthough earlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape,[489] theater still remains a popular contemporary American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theatergoers even as productions have become more elaborate and expensive.[490] The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018–19 season total attendance was 14,768,254 and $1,829,312,140 in grosses.[491]\n\n\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League[492] at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[493]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United States\n\n![](image)The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[494]\n\n\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large. The Smithsonian Institution states, \"African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.\"[495] One instrument first mass-produced in the United States was the banjo, which had originally been crafted from gourds covered by animal skins by African slaves.[496][497] Banjos became widely popular in the 19th century due to their use in minstrel shows.[496] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[498]\n\n\nThe United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in 2014.[499] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[500] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing musical acts in worldwide sales.[501][502][503] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[504] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[505] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[498] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey,[506][507] and of the early 21th century, such as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga.[508] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[509] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Renée Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[510]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States\n\n![](image)*Nighthawks* (1942) by Edward Hopper is one of his best-known works, Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[511] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[512]\n\n\nThe uniquely American \"Chicago School\" refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in European modernism. Much of its early work is known as \"Commercial Style\".[513] A \"Second Chicago School\" with a modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems, such as the tube-frame structure.[514] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[515]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of the United States\n\n![](image)The iconic Hollywood Sign, in the Hollywood Hills, often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[516][517][518] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[519][520] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[521] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[522] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[523]\n\n\nDirector D. W. Griffith's film adaptation of *The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan* was the first American blockbuster, earning the equivalent of $1.8 billion in current dollars. The technical achievements of the film revolutionized film grammar, while its subject matter caused both strident protest and a revitalization of the Klan.[524] Producer and entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[525] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[526] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[527][528] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[529] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[530] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[531][532]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American cuisine\n\nFurther information: List of American regional and fusion cuisines\n\n![](image)A bacon cheeseburger served with french fries, fried onions and ketchup\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[533] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[534][535] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[536]\n\n\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[537][538][539][540] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[541]\n\n\nThe American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[542] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's,[543] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among others, have numerous outlets around the world,[544]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in the United States\n\nSee also: Professional sports leagues in the United States, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and United States at the Olympics\n\n![](image)American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey, according to a 2017 *Gallup* poll.[545] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[546] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[547] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[548]\n\n\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[549] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[550] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[551][552]\n\n\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[553] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[554] In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.[555]\n\n\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[556] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[557][558][559]\n\n\nIn international soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[560] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[561]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of U.S. state topics\n* Outline of the United States\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 30 of 50 states recognize only English as an official language.

It is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery (primarily of Africans) led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. However, racial discrimination and inequality continued into subsequent centuries. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon, notably with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n\n\nThe United States government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been extensively shaped by the world's largest immigrant population.\n\n\nHighly developed, the U.S. has by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by nominal GDP. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter, as well as the largest consumer market. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of the United States and Demonyms for the United States\n\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[28][29][30] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in *The Virginia Gazette* newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[31]\n\n\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[32][33] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of United States history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)Cliff Palace, located in present-day Colorado, was built by Ancestral Puebloans.\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000BC, is believed to represent the first widespread culture in the Americas.[37][38] The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward.[39]\n\n\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in present-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region in present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Algonquian were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. Before European immigrants made contact, most of the Algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the \"Three Sisters\". By the time of European contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands' productivity and manage land.[43][44][45][46][47][48] The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[49] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[50] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants[51][52] range from around 500,000[53][51] to nearly 10 million.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Colonization (1492–1763)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial history of the United States\n\n![](image)British North America in 1775 with the 13 colonies shown in red\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, and Spain soon established Spanish Florida on the mainland.[54][55] \nThe Spanish Empire set up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in Saint Augustine (1565), which is often considered the nation's oldest city,[56] and Santa Fe (1598). The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in the present-day New York Bay region.[57] The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New Orleans (1718) and Mobile (1702).[58]\nBritish colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[59][60] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England seeking religious freedom.[61] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[62][63]\n\n\nDuring 17th-century European colonization, settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, particularly in King Philip's War, but often came to develop a mutual dependency. Settlers traded guns, tools, and European goods for food and animal pelts.[64] Native Americans taught settlers to cultivate local foods. Colonial authorities often pursued policies to to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urge or force them to adopt European lifestyles.[65][66] The native population of America declined after European arrival,[67][68][69] primarily as a result of infectious diseases brought from Europe such as smallpox and measles,[70][71] and native peoples were displaced by European expansion.[72]\n\n\nEuropean settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.[73] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the Southern Colonies.[74] Southern tobacco colonies passed laws designed to keep African Americans subservient.[75][76][77]\n\n\nThe original Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered by Great Britain.[78] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some areas, Catholics.[79][80] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[81] By the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[82] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance, [83] and the First Great Awakening—a series of Christian revivals—fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[84]\n\n\n\n### Revolution and the new nation (1763–1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1776–1789)\n\nFurther information: American Enlightenment\n\n![See caption](image)*Declaration of Independence*, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia\nAfter the British victory in the French and Indian War, won largely through the support from the colonies, the British began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. In 1774, to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the British government that extracted taxes from them, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The British attempted to disarm the Americans, resulting in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and charged a committee led by Thomas Jefferson with writing a Declaration of Independence.[85]\n\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.[86] After the surrender of a second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day Canada in the north to Florida in the south.[87] Washington resigned his commission, returned to private life, and the Continental Army was disbanded. \n\n\n\n![](image)*The Old Plantation*, a c. 1790 painting of a plantation by a South Carolina slaveholder\nRatified by the states in 1781 and based on the concept of \"consent of the governed\", the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[86] Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,[88] the Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states.[89] The prohibition of slavery in the Northwest Territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as an extension of the Mason–Dixon line, the geographic and political divide between slave states and free states.[90][91]\n\n\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was drafted. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[92] Ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789, reorganizing the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington was elected the nation's first President under the new constitution and returned to public life. The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by sceptics of the more centralized national government.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### Expansion (1789–1860)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1789–1849)\n ![](image)Animated map of the territorial evolution of the United States (click to view full size image)\nDuring the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies. However, during the American Revolution, many began to question the practice.[95] Founding Fathers in the northern United States advocated for the abolition of slavery, and slavery was abolished in Northern states.[96] The increased profitability for southern elites after the cotton gin lowered production costs entrenched support for slavery in the southern United States.[97][98][99]\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, with a sense of manifest destiny.[100] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) nearly doubled the territory of the United States, and effectively ended French opposition to America's westward expansion.[101] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a virtual draw but established the United States as capable of defending itself.[102] Spain ceded Florida and their Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[103] The Missouri Compromise (1820) admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, dividing the country into free states, which forbade slavery, and slave states, which protected the institution.[104] [105]\n\n\nAs Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[106][107] The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River.[108][109] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[105] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[110] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, resulting in the U.S. stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.[100][111]\n\n\n\n### Civil War and Reconstruction (1860–1876)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1849–1865) and 1865–1918\n\n![](image)Division of the states during the American Civil War\n * Union states\n* Border states\n* Confederate states\n* Territories\nSectional conflict regarding slavery[112] culminated in the American Civil War.[113] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states (the Union) maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[114] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston, South Carolina. The ensuing Civil War (1861–1865) became the deadliest military conflict in American history.[115] In 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor following the Siege of Vicksburg led by General Ulysses S. Grant, which gave them control of the Mississippi River, and the Battle of Gettysburg, where the Union Army halted Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered.[116]\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Chinese railroad workers on the Central Pacific Railroad, 1870\nThe Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Radical Republicans passed the Reconstruction Amendments to ensure the rights of African Americans. The biracial Southern governments were opposed by terrorist and paramilitary organizations. To encourage additional westward settlement the Homestead Acts allowed an applicant to acquire ownership of government land, by residing there. More than 160 million acres (650 thousand km2; 250 thousand sq mi)—nearly 10 percent of the total area of the United States—were given away free to 1.6 million homesteaders. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 was enacted to break a cycle of debt during Reconstruction. This act attempted to sell land at low prices so marginalized Southerners could buy it, but many were still too poor to afford the lower prices.[117] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred growth in the American Old West. New transcontinental railways made relocation easier, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[118]\n\n\n\n### Development of the modern United States (1876–1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1865–1918)\n\n![](image)An October 24th, 1874 Harper's Magazine editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast denouncing Ku Klux Klan and White League murders of African Americans\nThe Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[119][120] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[121] From 1890 to 1910, the Southern States established Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all African Americans. Racial segregation was prevalent nationwide and discrimination was codified, especially in the South,[122] while well into the 20th century lynching and other forms of unjustified vigilante violence often went unprosecuted.[123][124]\n\n\nTerritorial expansion continued apace. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[125] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish–American War.[126] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but through the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917,[127] allowing for the conscription of 20,000 Puerto Ricans, which began two months later.[128] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[129] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[130]\n\n\n\nAn Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[131][132]\nFrom 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe including Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Russia, and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.[133] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892 specifically through the now iconic Ellis Island. New York and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[134] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[135]\n\n\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[136] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[137] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[138][139][140] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[141]\n\n\n\n### World Wars period (1914–1945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1918–1945)\n\n![](image)The Trinity nuclear test in the Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945, part of the Manhattan Project and the first detonation of a nuclear weapon\nThe early 20th century was a time of industrial expansion and social change in the United States.[142][143] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[144] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[145] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the United States.[146] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[147][148]\n\n\nAt first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[149][150] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them again the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[151][152] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[153][154] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.[155]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary United States (1945–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), 1964–1980, 1980–1991, and 1991–2008\n\n![See caption](image)Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.\nAfter World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate the affairs of other countries.[156] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[157][158][159][160][161] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[162]\n\n\nThe civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[163] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable for recreational drug use, sexuality[164][165] and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in Vietnam.[166] The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, which led to a decline in public trust in government.[167]\n\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s saw economic stagflation and President Ronald Reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[168][169][170][171] By 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[172] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[173][174][175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Twin Towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks, 2001\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, the U.S. faced challenges from terrorism, with the September 11 attacks in 2001 leading to the war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[177][178] The U.S. housing bubble in 2006 culminated in the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[179] Amid the financial crisis, Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, was elected in 2008.[180][181]\n\n\nPolitical polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated political discussion.[182] The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 100 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths,[183] making it the most deadly pandemic in U.S. history.[184] Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election culminated in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power.[185]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the United States\n\n![](image)A topographic map of the United States\nThe United States is the world's third-largest nation by land and total area behind Russia and Canada.[c][186][187] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2).[188][189] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[190]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[191] The Mississippi River System—the world's fourth longest river system—runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[191]\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[192] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[193] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[194] about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[195] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[196] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[197]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Köppen climate types of the United States\nMain articles: Climate of the United States and Climate change in the United States\n\nWith its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[198] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[199]\n\n\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[200] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[201] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[202]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States\n\n![A bald eagle](image)The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States since 1782[203]\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[204] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[205] and 91,000 insect species.[206]\n\n\nThere are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[207] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[208] primarily in the western states.[209] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for industrial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[210][211]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biological diversity, logging and deforestation,[212][213] and climate change.[214][215] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[216] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[217] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[218] As of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[219] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[220]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Constitution of the United States, Politics of the United States, and Government of the United States\n\nFurther information: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, Political ideologies in the United States, American patriotism, and American civil religion\n\n![](image)The Capitol and its two legislative chambers, the Senate (left) and the House of Representatives (right)\n![](image)The White House, the residence and workplace of the U.S. President and the offices of the presidential staff\n![](image)The Supreme Court Building, which houses the nation's highest court\nThe United States was founded on the principles of the American Enlightenment. It is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[221][222] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and, according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[223] It is a liberal representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\"[224] The U.S. Constitution serves as the country's supreme legal document, establishing the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states.[225]\n\n\nThe federal government comprises three branches, which are headquartered in Washington, D.C. and regulated by a system of checks and balances.[226]\n\n\n\n* The U.S. Congress, a bicameral legislature, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[227] and has the power of impeachment.[228] The Senate has 100 members (2 from each state), elected for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members from single member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of population, elected for a two-year term.\n* The U.S. President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies through their respective agencies.[229] The president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election.[230] It is an indirect election, with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the Electoral College. The President and Vice President serve a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice.\n* The U.S. federal judiciary, whose judges are all appointed for life by the President with Senate approval, consists primarily of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[231] The Supreme Court is led by the chief justice of the United States. It has nine members who serve for life. The members are appointed by the sitting president when a vacancy becomes available.[232]\n\n\n### Political subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Political divisions of the United States, State government in the United States, Local government in the United States, and U.S. state\n\nFurther information: List of states and territories of the United States, Indian reservation, and Territories of the United States\n\nSee also: Territorial evolution of the United States\n\nIn the American federal system, sovereignty is shared between two levels of government: federal and state. Each of the 50 states has territory where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[233] The territories and the District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government.[234]\n\n![](image)\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States\n\n![see caption](image)The United Nations headquarters has been situated along the East River in Midtown Manhattan since 1952; in 1945, the United States was a founding member of the UN.\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019.[235] It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[236] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[237] The United States is a member of the G7,[238] G20,[239] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[240] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[241] North Korea,[242] and Bhutan.[243] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[244] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[245]\n\n\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[246] and strong ties with Canada,[247] Australia,[248] New Zealand,[249] the Philippines,[250] Japan,[251] South Korea,[252] Israel,[253] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[254] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[255] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[256] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[257] and its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[258][259] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine.[260][261]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Armed Forces and Military history of the United States\n\n![](image)The Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

the richest 10% of the adult population own 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom 50% own just 2%.[307] Income inequality in the U.S. remains at record highs,[308] with the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all income[309] and giving the U.S. one of the widest income distributions among OECD members.[310] The U.S. ranks first in the number of dollar billionaires and millionaires, with 724 billionaires[311] and nearly 22 million millionaires (as of 2021).[312] There were about 582,500 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in 2022, with 60% staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[313] In 2018 six million children experience food insecurity.[314] Feeding America estimates that around one in seven, or approximately 11 million, children experience hunger and do not know where they will get their next meal or when.[315] As of June 2018,[update] 40 million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, including 13.3 million children.[316]\n\n\nThe United States has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most other high-income countries.[317][318] It is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation nationally[319] and is one of a few countries in the world without federal paid family leave as a legal right.[320] The United States has a higher percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.[321]\n\n\n\n### Science, technology, and energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Science and technology in the United States, Science policy of the United States, Telecommunications in the United States, and Energy in the United States\n\n![](image)U.S. astronaut Buzz Aldrin saluting the flag on the Moon during the 1969 Apollo 11 mission. The United States is the only country that has sent crewed missions to the lunar surface.\nThe United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled America's large-scale manufacturing of consumer products in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[322] In 2022, the United States was the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers.[323] As of 2021, the U.S. ranked second by the number of patent applications, and third by trademark and industrial design applications.[324] In 2022, the United States ranked 3rd in the Global Innovation Index.[325]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], the United States receives approximately 79.1% of its energy from fossil fuels.[326] In 2021, the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (36.1%), followed by natural gas (32.2%), coal (10.8%), renewable sources (12.5%), and nuclear power (8.4%).[326] The United States constitutes less than 5% of the world's population, but consumes 17% of the world's energy.[327][328] The U.S. ranks as the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases.[329]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in the United States\n\n![](image)Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, is the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic with over 93 million passengers annually in 2022.[330]\nPersonal transportation in the United States is dominated by automobiles,[331][332] which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads, making it the longest network in the world.[333][334] The Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the Ford Model T, both American cars, are considered the first mass-produced[335] and mass-affordable[336] cars, respectively. As of 2022, the United States is the second-largest manufacturer of motor vehicles.[337] Currently, the American automotive industry is the world's second-largest automobile market by sales,[338] and the U.S. has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, [339] with 910 vehicles per 1000 people.[340] The United States's rail network, the longest in the world,[341] handles mostly freight.[342][343]\n\n\nThe American civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[344] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[345] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the top five and the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[346][347] As of 2020[update], there are 19,919 airports in the United States, of which 5,217 are designated as \"public use\", including for general aviation and other activities.[348]\n\n\nOf the fifty busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, of which the busiest is the Port of Los Angeles.[349] The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, and total 41,009 km (25,482 mi).[350]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of the United States\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Americans and Race and ethnicity in the United States\n\nSee also: List of U.S. states by population\n\n![](image)United States population density map based on Census 2010 data\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020,[m][351] making the United States the third-most populous nation in the world, after China and India.[352] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January 28, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[353] In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[354] In 2021, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.7 children per woman,[355] and it had the world's highest rate of children (23%) living in single-parent households in 2019.[356]\n\n\nThe United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[357] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa, form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population.[358][359] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population.

In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[365]\n\n\nAccording to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[366]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to the United States\n\nAmerica's immigrant population, numbering more than 50 million, is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[367][368] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[369] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[370] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[371] The United States has led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[372]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligious affiliation in USA, per Gallup, Inc.

New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious,[385] although Mormonism—a Restorationist Christian movement started in New York in the 19th century—is the predominant religious affiliation in Utah.[386]\n\n\nAround 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith.[387] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.[388] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[389] Religious belief and interest has remained relatively stable in recent years; organizational participation, in contrast, has decreased.[390] Other notable faiths include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, many New Age movements, and a large variety of Native American religions.[391]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population\n\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[186] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[392] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[393] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[394]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in the United States2023 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[395]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |  |\n| ![New York](image)New York![Los Angeles](image)Los Angeles | 1 | New York | Northeast | 19,498,249 | 11 | Boston | Northeast | 4,919,179\n | ![Chicago](image)Chicago![Dallas–Fort Worth](image)Dallas–Fort Worth |\n| 2 | Los Angeles | West | 12,799,100 | 12 | Riverside–San Bernardino | West | 4,688,053\n |\n| 3 | Chicago | Midwest | 9,262,825 | 13 | San Francisco | West | 4,566,961\n |\n| 4 | Dallas–Fort Worth | South | 8,100,037 | 14 | Detroit | Midwest | 4,342,304\n |\n| 5 | Houston | South | 7,510,253 | 15 | Seattle | West | 4,044,837\n |\n| 6 | Atlanta | South | 6,307,261 | 16 | Minneapolis–Saint Paul | Midwest | 3,712,020\n |\n| 7 | Washington, D.C. | South | 6,304,975 | 17 | Tampa–St. Petersburg | South | 3,342,963\n |\n| 8 | Philadelphia | Northeast | 6,246,160 | 18 | San Diego | West | 3,269,973\n |\n| 9 | Miami | South | 6,183,199 | 19 | Denver | West | 3,005,131\n |\n| 10 | Phoenix | West | 5,070,110 | 20 | Baltimore | South | 2,834,316\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Healthcare in the United States, Healthcare reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\n\n![The Texas Medical Center, a cluster of contemporary skyscrapers, at night](image)Texas Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, employing 106,000 people and treating 10 million patients annually as of 2016.[396]\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. The chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[397][398] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Black and American Indian–Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[399][400] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[401] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[402] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[403] Poverty is the 4th leading risk factor for premature death in the United States annually, according to a 2023 study published in *JAMA*.[404][405]\n\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations.[406] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[407]\n\n\nGovernment-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[o][408] with the law roughly halving the uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[409] Its legacy remains controversial.[410]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States\n\n![Photograph of the University of Virginia](image)The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of many public colleges and universities in the United States.\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[411] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[412] The basic literacy rate is near-universal.[186][413] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).[414][415]\n\n\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education including many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[416][417][418] There are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[419] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[420] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[421]\n\n\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[422] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[423] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[424] and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of 2022.[425]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of the United States and Society of the United States\n\n![The Statue of Liberty, a large teal bronze sculpture on a stone pedestal](image)The Statue of Liberty (*Liberty Enlightening the World*) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream.[426]\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[427][428] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[429][430] having a strong work ethic,[431] competitiveness,[432] and voluntary altruism towards others.[433][434][435] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.[436] Part of both the Anglosphere and Western World, the United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[437][438] and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale,[439][440] with the phenomenon being termed *Americanization*.[441] As such, the U.S. is considered a cultural superpower.[442]\n\n\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[443] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[437][444] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[437] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[445] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[446][447][448][449] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[450] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[451] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[452]\n\n\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[453] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[454][455][456] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[457] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[458] It is a socially progressive country[459] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[460] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world.[460][461][462]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American literature and American philosophy\n\n![Photograph of Mark Twain](image)Mark Twain, who William Faulkner called \"the father of American literature\"[463]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[464]\n\n\nAlmost until the 20th century pervasive anti-literacy laws prevented most people of color from learning to read or write.[465][466] In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated from the Southern United States and West Indies. Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the *négritude* philosophy.[467]\n\n\nSince its first use in the 19th century, the term \"Great American Novel\" has been applied to many books, including Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852), Twain's *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* (1925), John Steinbeck's *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939), Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1960), Toni Morrison's *Beloved* (1987), and David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* (1996).[468][469][470]\n\n\nThirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise Glück, Bob Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[471] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck have been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[472]\n\n\n\n### Mass media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mass media in the United States\n\nSee also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, Radio in the United States, and Video games in the United States\n\n![](image)Comcast Center in Philadelphia, headquarters of Comcast, the world's largest telecommunications and media conglomerate\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[473] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[474] As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[475] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[476]\n\n\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *USA Today*.[477] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[478][479] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as *The Village Voice* in New York City and *LA Weekly* in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[480]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the video game market of the United States is the world's largest by revenue.[481] Major video game publishers and developers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[482][483] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[484]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theater in the United States\n\n![](image)Broadway theatres in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City\nThe United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[485] In the 19th century, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[486]\n\n\nThe central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[487] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[488]\n\n\nAlthough earlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape,[489] theater still remains a popular contemporary American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theatergoers even as productions have become more elaborate and expensive.[490] The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018–19 season total attendance was 14,768,254 and $1,829,312,140 in grosses.[491]\n\n\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League[492] at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[493]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United States\n\n![](image)The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[494]\n\n\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large. The Smithsonian Institution states, \"African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.\"[495] One instrument first mass-produced in the United States was the banjo, which had originally been crafted from gourds covered by animal skins by African slaves.[496][497] Banjos became widely popular in the 19th century due to their use in minstrel shows.[496] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[498]\n\n\nThe United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in 2014.[499] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[500] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing musical acts in worldwide sales.[501][502][503] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[504] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[505] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[498] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey,[506][507] and of the early 21th century, such as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga.[508] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[509] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Renée Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[510]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States\n\n![](image)*Nighthawks* (1942) by Edward Hopper is one of his best-known works, Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[511] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[512]\n\n\nThe uniquely American \"Chicago School\" refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in European modernism. Much of its early work is known as \"Commercial Style\".[513] A \"Second Chicago School\" with a modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems, such as the tube-frame structure.[514] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[515]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of the United States\n\n![](image)The iconic Hollywood Sign, in the Hollywood Hills, often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[516][517][518] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[519][520] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[521] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[522] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[523]\n\n\nDirector D. W. Griffith's film adaptation of *The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan* was the first American blockbuster, earning the equivalent of $1.8 billion in current dollars. The technical achievements of the film revolutionized film grammar, while its subject matter caused both strident protest and a revitalization of the Klan.[524] Producer and entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[525] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[526] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[527][528] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[529] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[530] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[531][532]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American cuisine\n\nFurther information: List of American regional and fusion cuisines\n\n![](image)A bacon cheeseburger served with french fries, fried onions and ketchup\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[533] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[534][535] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[536]\n\n\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[537][538][539][540] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[541]\n\n\nThe American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[542] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's,[543] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among others, have numerous outlets around the world,[544]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in the United States\n\nSee also: Professional sports leagues in the United States, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and United States at the Olympics\n\n![](image)American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey, according to a 2017 *Gallup* poll.[545] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[546] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[547] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[548]\n\n\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[549] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[550] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[551][552]\n\n\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[553] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[554] In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.[555]\n\n\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[556] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[557][558][559]\n\n\nIn international soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[560] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[561]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of U.S. state topics\n* Outline of the United States\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 30 of 50 states recognize only English as an official language.
