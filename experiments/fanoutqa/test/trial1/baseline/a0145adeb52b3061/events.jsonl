subcontinent between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago.[1] The earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago. Sedentariness began in South Asia around 7000 BCE;[2] by 4500 BCE, settled life had spread,[2] and gradually evolved into the Indus Valley civilisation, which flourished between 2500 BCE and 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan and north-western India. Early in the second millennium BCE, persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter from large urban centres to villages. Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration. The Vedic Period (1500–500 BCE) was marked by the composition of their large collections of hymns (Vedas). The social structure was stratified via the varna system, which persists till this day. The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain. Around 600 BCE, a new, interregional culture arose; then, small chieftaincies (janapadas) were consolidated into larger states (mahajanapadas). A second urbanisation took place, which came with the rise of new ascetic movements and religious concepts,[3] including the rise of Jainism and Buddhism. The latter was synthesised with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, giving rise to Hinduism.\n\n\n\n![](image)Indian cultural influence (Greater India)\n![](image)Timeline of Indian history\nChandragupta Maurya overthrew the Nanda Empire and established the first great empire in ancient India, the Maurya Empire. The Maurya Empire would collapse in 185 BCE, on the assassination of the then-emperor Brihadratha by his general Pushyamitra Shunga. Shunga would go on to form the Shunga Empire in the north and northeast of the subcontinent, while the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom would claim the northwest and found the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties, including the Gupta Empire, in the 4th to 6th centuries CE. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the Classical or Golden Age of India. Aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion spread to much of Asia, which led to the establishment of Indianised kingdoms in the region, forming Greater India.[4][5] The most significant event between the 7th and 11th century was the Tripartite struggle centred on Kannauj. Southern India saw the rise of multiple imperial powers from the middle of the fifth century. The Chola dynasty conquered southern India in the 11th century.[6][7] In the early medieval period Indian mathematics, including Hindu numerals, influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Arab world, including the creation of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.[8]\n\n\nIslamic conquests made limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Sindh as early as the 8th century,[9] followed by the invasions of Mahmud Ghazni.[10]\nThe Delhi Sultanate was founded in 1206 CE by Central Asian Turks who ruled a major part of the northern Indian subcontinent in the early 14th century, but declined in the late 14th century,[11] and saw the advent of the Deccan sultanates.[12] The wealthy Bengal Sultanate also emerged as a major power, lasting over three centuries.[13] This period also saw the emergence of several powerful Hindu states, notably the Vijayanagara Empire and Rajput states. The 15th century saw the advent of Sikhism. \n\n\nThe early modern period began in the 16th century, when the Mughal Empire conquered most of the Indian subcontinent,[14] signaling the proto-industrialization, becoming the biggest global economy and manufacturing power.[15][16][17] The Mughals suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, which provided opportunities for the Marathas, Sikhs, Mysoreans, Nizams, and Nawabs of Bengal to control large regions of the Indian subcontinent.[18][19] From the mid-18th to the mid-19th century, large regions of India were gradually annexed by the East India Company, acting as a sovereign power on behalf of the British government. Dissatisfaction with company rule in India led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. India was afterwards ruled directly by the British Crown, in the British Raj. After World War I, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian National Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi. Later, the All-India Muslim League would advocate for a separate Muslim-majority nation state. The British Indian Empire was partitioned in August 1947 into the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan, each gaining its independence.\n\n\n\n\n##  Prehistoric era (until c. 3300 BCE)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains too many or overly lengthy quotations**.

Then, intermittently, sometime between 60,000 and 80,000 years ago, tiny groups of them began to enter the north-west of the Indian subcontinent. It seems likely that initially, they came by way of the coast. ... it is virtually certain that there were Homo sapiens in the subcontinent 55,000 years ago, even though the earliest fossils that have been found of them date to only about 30,000 years before the present.[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to Michael D. Petraglia and Bridget Allchin: \n\n\n> Y-Chromosome and Mt-DNA data support the colonization of South Asia by modern humans originating in Africa. ... Coalescence dates for most non-European populations average to between 73–55 ka.[30]\n> \n> \n\n\nHistorian of South Asia, Michael H. Fisher, states: \n\n\n> Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the Homo sapiens range beyond Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago to as late as 40,000 years ago, although there may have been prior unsuccessful emigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each generation, spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago.[31]\n> \n> \n\n\nArchaeological evidence has been interpreted to suggest the presence of anatomically modern humans in the Indian subcontinent 78,000–74,000 years ago,[32] although this interpretation is disputed.[33][34] The occupation of South Asia by modern humans, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has turned it into a highly diverse one, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[35]\n\n\n\nAccording to Tim Dyson: \n\n\n> Genetic research has contributed to knowledge of the prehistory of the subcontinent's people in other respects. In particular, the level of genetic diversity in the region is extremely high. Indeed, only Africa's population is genetically more diverse. Related to this, there is strong evidence of 'founder' events in the subcontinent. By this is meant circumstances where a subgroup—such as a tribe—derives from a tiny number of 'original' individuals. Further, compared to most world regions, the subcontinent's people are relatively distinct in having practised comparatively high levels of endogamy.[35]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Neolithic[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mehrgarh site, in Beluchistan, Pakistan\nSettled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus River alluvium approximately 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[2][36] According to Tim Dyson: \"By 7,000 years ago agriculture was firmly established in Baluchistan... [and] slowly spread eastwards into the Indus valley.\" Michael Fisher adds:[37] \n\n\n> The earliest discovered instance ... of well-established, settled agricultural society is at Mehrgarh in the hills between the Bolan Pass and the Indus plain (today in Pakistan) (see Map 3.1). From as early as 7000 BCE, communities there started investing increased labor in preparing the land and selecting, planting, tending, and harvesting particular grain-producing plants. They also domesticated animals, including sheep, goats, pigs, and oxen (both humped zebu [*Bos indicus*] and unhumped [*Bos taurus*]). Castrating oxen, for instance, turned them from mainly meat sources into domesticated draft-animals as well.[37]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Bronze Age (c. 3300 – c. 1800 BCE)[edit]\n\n\n### Indus Valley Civilisation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indus Valley Civilisation\n\nSee also: List of Indus Valley Civilisation sites\n\n![](image)Mature Harappan Period, c. 2600 - 1900 BCE\nThe Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent began around 3300 BCE.[*citation needed*] The Indus Valley region was one of three early cradles of civilization in the Old World; the Indus Valley civilisation was the most expansive,[38] and at its peak, may have had a population of over five million.[39]\n\n\nThe civilisation was primarily centered in modern-day Pakistan, in the Indus river basin, and secondarily in the Ghaggar-Hakra River basin. The mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilisation on the Indian subcontinent. It included cities such as Harappa, Ganweriwal, and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan, and Dholavira, Kalibangan, Rakhigarhi, and Lothal in modern-day India.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mohenjo-daro, one of the largest Indus cities.

Civilization also developed a Indus script, which is presently undeciphered.[41] This is the reason why Harappan language is not directly attested, and its affiliation uncertain.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Three stamp seals and their impressions bearing Indus script characters alongside animals: \"unicorn\" (left), bull (center), and elephant (right); Guimet Museum\nAfter the collapse of Indus Valley civilisation, the inhabitants migrated from the river valleys of Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra, towards the Himalayan foothills of Ganga-Yamuna basin.[43]\n\n\n\n### Ochre Coloured Pottery culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinauli \"*chariot\"*, photograph of the Archaeological Survey of India.[44]\nDuring 2nd millennium BCE, Ochre Coloured Pottery culture was in Ganga Yamuna Doab region. These were rural settlement with agriculture and hunting. They were using copper tools such as axes, spears, arrows, and swords, and had domesticated animals.[45]\n\n\n\n## Iron Age (c. 1800 – 200 BCE)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Iron Age in India\n\n### Vedic period (c. 1500 – 600 BCE)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Vedic period, Historical Vedic religion, and Vedas\n\nSee also: Indo-Aryan peoples and Indo-Aryan migrations\n\nStarting ca. 1900 BCE, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration.[46][47] The Vedic period is the period when the Vedas were composed, the liturgical hymns from the Indo-Aryan people. The Vedic culture was located in part of north-west India, while other parts of India had a distinct cultural identity. Many regions of the Indian subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age in this period.[48]\n\n\nThe Vedic culture is described in the texts of Vedas, still sacred to Hindus, which were orally composed and transmitted in Vedic Sanskrit. The Vedas are some of the oldest extant texts in India.[49] The Vedic period, lasting from about 1500 to 500 BCE,[50][51] contributed the foundations of several cultural aspects of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\n\n#### Vedic society[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An early 19th century manuscript in the Devanagari script of the Rigveda, originally transmitted orally with fidelity[52]\nHistorians have analysed the Vedas to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[48] The peepal tree and cow were sanctified by the time of the Atharva Veda.[53] Many of the concepts of Indian philosophy espoused later, like dharma, trace their roots to Vedic antecedents.[54]\n\n\nEarly Vedic society is described in the Rigveda, the oldest Vedic text, believed to have been compiled during 2nd millennium BCE,[55][56] in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent.[57] At this time, Aryan society consisted of largely tribal and pastoral groups, distinct from the Harappan urbanisation which had been abandoned.[58] The early Indo-Aryan presence probably corresponds, in part, to the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture in archaeological contexts.[59][60]\n\n\nAt the end of the Rigvedic period, the Aryan society began to expand from the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent, into the western Ganges plain. It became increasingly agricultural and was socially organised around the hierarchy of the four *varnas*, or social classes. This social structure was characterized both by syncretising with the native cultures of northern India,[61] but also eventually by the excluding of some indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure.[62] During this period, many of the previous small tribal units and chiefdoms began to coalesce into Janapadas (monarchical, state-level polities).[63]\n\n\n\n#### Janapadas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Janapada\n\nSee also: Battle of the Ten Kings and List of ancient Indo-Aryan peoples and tribes\n\n![](image)Late Vedic era map showing the boundaries of Āryāvarta with Janapadas in northern India, beginning of Iron Age kingdoms in India – Kuru, Panchala, Kosala, Videha\nThe Iron Age in the Indian subcontinent from about 1200 BCE to the 6th century BCE is defined by the rise of Janapadas, which are realms, republics and kingdoms—notably the Iron Age Kingdoms of Kuru, Panchala, Kosala, Videha.[64][65]\n\n\nThe Kuru Kingdom (c. 1200–450 BCE) was the first state-level society of the Vedic period, corresponding to the beginning of the Iron Age in northwestern India, around 1200–800 BCE,[66] as well as with the composition of the Atharvaveda.[67] The Kuru state organised the Vedic hymns into collections, and developed the srauta ritual to uphold the social order.[67] Two key figures of the Kuru state were king Parikshit and his successor Janamejaya, transforming this realm into the dominant political, social, and cultural power of northern India.[67] When the Kuru kingdom declined, the centre of Vedic culture shifted to their eastern neighbours, the Panchala kingdom.[67] The archaeological PGW (Painted Grey Ware) culture, which flourished in the Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh regions of northern India from about 1100 to 600 BCE,[59] is believed to correspond to the Kuru and Panchala kingdoms.[67][68]\n\n\nDuring the Late Vedic Period, the kingdom of Videha emerged as a new centre of Vedic culture, situated even farther to the East (in what is today Nepal and Bihar state);[60] reaching its prominence under the king Janaka, whose court provided patronage for Brahmin sages and philosophers such as Yajnavalkya, Aruni, and Gārgī Vāchaknavī.[69] The later part of this period corresponds with a consolidation of increasingly large states and kingdoms, called *Mahajanapadas*, across Northern India.\n\n\n\n### Second urbanisation (c. 600 – 200 BCE)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City of Kushinagar in the 5th century BCE according to a 1st-century BCE frieze in Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern Gate.\nThe period between 800 and 200 BCE saw the formation of the *Śramaṇa* movement, from which Jainism and Buddhism originated. The first Upanishads were written during this period. After 500 BCE, the so-called \"second urbanisation\"[note 1] started, with new urban settlements arising at the Ganges plain.[70] The foundations for the \"second urbanisation\" were laid prior to 600 BCE, in the Painted Grey Ware culture of the Ghaggar-Hakra and Upper Ganges Plain; although most PGW sites were small farming villages, \"several dozen\" PGW sites eventually emerged as relatively large settlements that can be characterized as towns, the largest of which were fortified by ditches or moats and embankments made of piled earth with wooden palisades.[71]\n\n\nThe Central Ganges Plain, where Magadha gained prominence, forming the base of the Maurya Empire, was a distinct cultural area,[72] with new states arising after 500 BCE.[73][74] It was influenced by the Vedic culture,[75] but differed markedly from the Kuru-Panchala region.[72] It \"was the area of the earliest known cultivation of rice in South Asia and by 1800 BCE was the location of an advanced Neolithic population associated with the sites of Chirand and Chechar\".[76] In this region, the Śramaṇic movements flourished, and Jainism and Buddhism originated.[70]\n\n\n\n#### Buddhism and Jainism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Upanishads and Śramaṇa\n\nFurther information: History of Hinduism, History of Buddhism, History of Jainism, Indian religions, and Indian philosophy\n\nUpanishads and Śramaṇa movements\n![](image)\nA page of *Isha Upanishad* manuscript.\n![](image)\nMahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara of Jainism.\n![](image)\nGautama Buddha's cremation stupa, Kushinagar (Kushinara).\n\nThe time between 800 BCE and 400 BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads,[77][78][79] which form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism, and are also known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Vedas).[80]\n\n\nThe increasing urbanisation of India in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or \"Śramaṇa movements\" which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals.[77] Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE), proponent of Jainism, and Gautama Buddha (c. 563–483 BCE), founder of Buddhism, were the most prominent icons of this movement. Śramaṇa gave rise to the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara, and the concept of liberation.[81] Buddha found a Middle Way that ameliorated the extreme asceticism found in the *Śramaṇa* religions.[82]\n\n\nAround the same time, Mahavira (the 24th *Tirthankara* in Jainism) propagated a theology that was to later become Jainism.[83] However, Jain orthodoxy believes the teachings of the *Tirthankaras* predates all known time and scholars believe Parshvanatha (c. 872 – c. 772 BCE), accorded status as the 23rd *Tirthankara*, was a historical figure. The Vedas are believed to have documented a few *Tirthankaras* and an ascetic order similar to the *Śramaṇa* movement.[84]\n\n\n\n#### Sanskrit epics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mahabharata and Ramayana\n\nSee also: List of historic Indian texts and List of Hindu texts\n\n![](image)Manuscript illustration of the Battle of Kurukshetra.\nThe Sanskrit epics *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata* were composed during this period.[85] The *Mahabharata* remains the longest single poem in the world.[86] Historians formerly postulated an \"epic age\" as the milieu of these two epic poems, but now recognize that the texts went through multiple stages of development over centuries.[87] The existing texts of these epics are believed to belong to the post-Vedic age, between c. 400 BCE and 400 CE.[87][88]\n\n\n\n#### Mahajanapadas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mahajanapadas\n\n![](image)The Mahajanapadas were the sixteen most powerful and vast kingdoms and republics of the era, located mainly across the Indo-Gangetic plains.\nThe period from c. 600 BCE to c. 300 BCE witnessed the rise of the Mahajanapadas, sixteen powerful and vast kingdoms and oligarchic republics. These Mahajanapadas evolved and flourished in a belt stretching from Gandhara in the northwest to Bengal in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent and included parts of the trans-Vindhyan region.[89] Ancient Buddhist texts, like the *Aṅguttara Nikāya*,[90] make frequent reference to these sixteen great kingdoms and republics—Anga, Assaka, Avanti, Chedi, Gandhara, Kashi, Kamboja, Kosala, Kuru, Magadha, Malla, Matsya (or Machcha), Panchala, Surasena, Vṛji, and Vatsa. This period saw the second major rise of urbanism in India after the Indus Valley Civilisation.[91]\n\n\nEarly \"republics\" or *gaṇasaṅgha*,[92] such as Shakyas, Koliyas, Mallakas, and Licchavis had republican governments. *Gaṇasaṅgha*s,[92] such as the Mallakas, centered in the city of Kusinagara, and the Vajjika League, centered in the city of Vaishali, existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE.[93] The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the Licchavis.[94]\n\n\nThis period corresponds in an archaeological context to the Northern Black Polished Ware culture. Especially focused in the Central Ganges plain but also spreading across vast areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent, this culture is characterized by the emergence of large cities with massive fortifications, significant population growth, increased social stratification, wide-ranging trade networks, construction of public architecture and water channels, specialized craft industries, a system of weights, punch-marked coins, and the introduction of writing in the form of Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts.[95][96] The language of the gentry at that time was Sanskrit, while the languages of the general population of northern India are referred to as Prakrits.\n\n\nMany of the sixteen kingdoms had coalesced into four major ones by 500/400 BCE, by the time of Gautama Buddha. These four were Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala, and Magadha.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Early Magadha dynasties[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Magadha and Greater Magadha\n\nSee also: Magadha period, Pradyota dynasty, Haryanka dynasty, and Shaishunaga dynasty\n\nMaghada dynasties\n![](image)\nThe Magadha state c. 600 BCE, before it expanded from its capital Rajagriha – under the Haryanka dynasty and the successor Shishunaga dynasty.\n![](image)\nIndian warrior of the Achaemenid army, circa 480 BCE, on the Tomb of Xerxes I.\n\nMagadha formed one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas (Sanskrit: \"Great Realms\") or kingdoms in ancient India. The core of the kingdom was the area of Bihar south of the Ganges; its first capital was Rajagriha (modern Rajgir) then Pataliputra (modern Patna). Magadha expanded to include most of Bihar and Bengal with the conquest of Licchavi and Anga respectively,[97] followed by much of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Orissa. The ancient kingdom of Magadha is heavily mentioned in Jain and Buddhist texts. It is also mentioned in the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas.[98] The earliest reference to the Magadha people occurs in the Atharva-Veda where they are found listed along with the Angas, Gandharis, and Mujavats. Magadha played an important role in the development of Jainism and Buddhism. The Magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions.\n\n\nEarly sources, from the Buddhist Pāli Canon, the Jain Agamas and the Hindu Puranas, mention Magadha being ruled by the Pradyota dynasty and Haryanka dynasty (c. 544–413 BCE) for some 200 years, c. 600–413 BCE. King Bimbisara of the Haryanka dynasty led an active and expansive policy, conquering Anga in what is now eastern Bihar and West Bengal. King Bimbisara was overthrown and killed by his son, Prince Ajatashatru, who continued the expansionist policy of Magadha. During this period, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, lived much of his life in the Magadha kingdom. He attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, gave his first sermon in Sarnath and the first Buddhist council was held in Rajgriha.[99] The Haryanka dynasty was overthrown by the Shaishunaga dynasty (c. 413–345 BCE). The last Shishunaga ruler, Kalasoka, was assassinated by Mahapadma Nanda in 345 BCE, the first of the so-called Nine Nandas (Mahapadma and his eight sons).\n\n\n\n#### Nanda Empire and Alexander's campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nanda Empire\n\nSee also: Indian campaign of Alexander the Great\n\nThe Nanda Empire (c. 345–322 BCE), at its greatest extent, extended from Bengal in the east, to the Punjab region in the west and as far south as the Vindhya Range.[100] The Nanda dynasty was famed for their great wealth. The Nanda dynasty built on the foundations laid by their Haryanka and Shishunaga predecessors to create the first great empire of north India.[101] To achieve this objective they built a vast army, consisting of 200,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalry, 2,000 war chariots and 3,000 war elephants (at the lowest estimates).[102][103][104][105]\n\n\n\n#### Maurya Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Maurya Empire\n\nMaurya Empire\n![](image)\nThe Maurya Empire under Ashoka the Great.\n![](image)\nAshokan pillar at Vaishali, 3rd century BCE.\n\nThe Maurya Empire (322–185 BCE) unified most of the Indian subcontinent into one state, and was the largest empire ever to exist on the Indian subcontinent.[106] At its greatest extent, the Mauryan Empire stretched to the north up to the natural boundaries of the Himalayas and to the east into what is now Assam. To the west, it reached beyond modern Pakistan, to the Hindu Kush mountains in what is now Afghanistan. The empire was established by Chandragupta Maurya assisted by Chanakya (Kautilya) in Magadha (in modern Bihar) when he overthrew the Nanda Empire.[107]\n\n\nChandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India, and by 317 BCE the empire had fully occupied Northwestern India. The Mauryan Empire defeated Seleucus I, founder of the Seleucid Empire, during the Seleucid–Mauryan war, thus gained additional territory west of the Indus River. Chandragupta's son Bindusara succeeded to the throne around 297 BCE. By the time he died in c. 272 BCE, a large part of the Indian subcontinent was under Mauryan suzerainty. However, the region of Kalinga (around modern day Odisha) remained outside Mauryan control, perhaps interfering with trade with the south.[108]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Mauryan carved door of Lomas Rishi, one of the Barabar Caves, c. 250 BCE.\nBindusara was succeeded by Ashoka, whose reign lasted until his death in about 232 BCE.[109] His campaign against the Kalingans in about 260 BCE, though successful, led to immense loss of life and misery. This led Ashoka to shun violence, and subsequently to embrace Buddhism.[108] The empire began to decline after his death and the last Mauryan ruler, Brihadratha, was assassinated by Pushyamitra Shunga to establish the Shunga Empire.[109]\n\n\nUnder Chandragupta Maurya and his successors, internal and external trade, agriculture, and economic activities all thrived and expanded across India thanks to the creation of a single efficient system of finance, administration, and security. The Mauryans built the Grand Trunk Road, one of Asia's oldest and longest major roads connecting the Indian subcontinent with Central Asia.[110] After the Kalinga War, the Empire experienced nearly half a century of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of scientific knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across India. Ashoka sponsored Buddhist missions into Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, West Asia, North Africa, and Mediterranean Europe.[111]\n\n\nThe *Arthashastra* written by Chanakya and the Edicts of Ashoka are the primary written records of the Mauryan times. Archaeologically, this period falls in the era of Northern Black Polished Ware. The Mauryan Empire was based on a modern and efficient economy and society. However, the sale of merchandise was closely regulated by the government.[112] Although there was no banking in the Mauryan society, usury was customary. A significant amount of written records on slavery are found, suggesting a prevalence thereof.[113] During this period, a high-quality steel called Wootz steel was developed in south India and was later exported to China and Arabia.[114]\n\n\n\n#### Sangam period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sangam period, Sources of ancient Tamil history, Sangam literature, and Five Great Epics\n\nSee also: Three Crowned Kings, Tamilakam, and List of Tamil monarchs\n\n![](image)\nTamilakam, located in the tip of South India during the Sangam period, ruled by Chera dynasty, Chola dynasty and the Pandyan dynasty.\n![](image)\nIlango Adigal is the author of *Silappatikaram*, one of the five great epics of Tamil literature.[115]\n\nDuring the Sangam period Tamil literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 4th century CE. Three Tamil dynasties, collectively known as the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam: Chera dynasty, Chola dynasty, and the Pandya dynasty ruled parts of southern India.[116]\n\n\nThe Sangam literature deals with the history, politics, wars, and culture of the Tamil people of this period.[117] Unlike Sanskrit writers who were mostly Brahmins, Sangam writers came from diverse classes and social backgrounds and were mostly non-Brahmins.[118]\n\n\nAround c. 300 BCE – c. 200 CE, Pathupattu, an anthology of ten mid-length book collections, which is considered part of Sangam Literature, were composed; the composition of eight anthologies of poetic works Ettuthogai as well as the composition of eighteen minor poetic works Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku; while Tolkāppiyam, the earliest grammarian work in the Tamil language was developed.[119] Also, during Sangam period, two of the Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature were composed. Ilango Adigal composed *Silappatikaram*, which is a non-religious work, that revolves around Kannagi,[120] and *Manimekalai*, composed by Chithalai Chathanar, is a sequel to *Silappatikaram*, and tells the story of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, who became a Buddhist Bikkuni.[121][122]\n\n\n\n## Classical period (c. 200 BCE – c. 650 CE)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Classical India\n\n* ![Ancient India during the rise of the Shungas from the North, Satavahanas from the Deccan, and Pandyas and Cholas from the southern tip of India.](image)\n\nAncient India during the rise of the Shungas from the North, Satavahanas from the Deccan, and Pandyas and Cholas from the southern tip of India.\n* ![The Great Chaitya in the Karla Caves.

Also, the Sangam literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE in southern India.[126] During this period, India's economy is estimated to have been the largest in the world, having between one-third and one-quarter of the world's wealth, from 1 CE to 1000 CE.[127][128]\n\n\n\n### Early classical period (c. 200 BCE – c. 320 CE)[edit]\n\n\n#### Shunga Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shunga Empire\n\nShunga Empire\n![](image)\nEast Gateway and Railings, Bharhut Stupa, 2nd century BCE.\n![](image)\nShunga art, 1st century BCE. Ancient vina\n![](image)\nRoyal family, 1st century B.C. West Bengal.\n\nThe Shungas originated from Magadha, and controlled large areas of the central and eastern Indian subcontinent from around 187 to 78 BCE. The dynasty was established by Pushyamitra Shunga, who overthrew the last Maurya emperor. Its capital was Pataliputra, but later emperors, such as Bhagabhadra, also held court at Vidisha, modern Besnagar.[129]\n\n\nPushyamitra Shunga ruled for 36 years and was succeeded by his son Agnimitra. There were ten Shunga rulers. However, after the death of Agnimitra, the empire rapidly disintegrated;[130] inscriptions and coins indicate that much of northern and central India consisted of small kingdoms and city-states that were independent of any Shunga hegemony.[131] The empire is noted for its numerous wars with both foreign and indigenous powers. They fought with the Mahameghavahana dynasty of Kalinga, Satavahana dynasty of Deccan, the Indo-Greeks, and possibly the Panchalas and Mitras of Mathura.\n\n\nArt, education, philosophy, and other forms of learning flowered during this period including architectural monuments such as the Stupa at Bharhut and the renowned Great Stupa at Sanchi. The Shunga rulers helped to establish the tradition of royal sponsorship of learning and art. The script used by the empire was a variant of Brahmi and was used to write the Sanskrit language. The Shunga Empire played an imperative role in patronising Indian culture at a time when some of the most important developments in Hindu thought were taking place.\n\n\n\n#### Satavahana Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Satavahana Empire\n\nSatavahana Empire\n![](image)\nSanchi Stupa Two and Southern Gateway, 1st century CE (UNESCO World Heritage Site).\n![](image)\nIndian ship on lead coin of Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi, testimony to the naval, seafaring and trading capabilities of the Sātavāhanas during the 1st–2nd century CE.\n\nThe Śātavāhanas were based from Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh as well as Junnar (Pune) and Prathisthan (Paithan) in Maharashtra. The territory of the empire covered large parts of India from the 1st century BCE onward. The Sātavāhanas started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty, but declared independence with its decline.\n\n\nThe Sātavāhanas are known for their patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism, which resulted in Buddhist monuments from Ellora (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) to Amaravati. They were one of the first Indian states to issue coins with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India.\n\n\nThey had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynasty of Magadha to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect large part of India against foreign invaders like the Sakas, Yavanas and Pahlavas. In particular, their struggles with the Western Kshatrapas went on for a long time. The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Yajna Sātakarni were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the Western Kshatrapas and to stop their expansion. In the 3rd century CE the empire was split into smaller states.[132]\n\n\n\n#### Trade and travels to India[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Silk Road transmission of Buddhism\n\n![](image)Silk Road and Spice trade, ancient trade routes that linked India with the Old World; carried goods and ideas between the ancient civilisations of the Old World and India. The land routes are red, and the water routes are blue.\nThe spice trade in Kerala attracted traders from all over the Old World to India. India's Southwest coastal port Muziris had established itself as a major spice trade centre from as early as 3,000 BCE, according to Sumerian records. Jewish traders arrived in Kochi, Kerala, India as early as 562 BCE.[133] The Greco-Roman world followed by trading along the incense route and the Roman-India routes.[134] During the 2nd century BCE Greek and Indian ships met to trade at Arabian ports such as Aden.[135] During the first millennium, the sea routes to India were controlled by the Indians and Ethiopians that became the maritime trading power of the Red Sea. Indian merchants involved in spice trade took Indian cuisine to Southeast Asia, where spice mixtures and curries became popular with the native inhabitants.[136]\nBuddhism entered China through the Silk Road in the 1st or 2nd century CE.[137] Hindu and Buddhist religious establishments of Southeast Asia came to be associated with the economic activity and commerce as patrons entrust large funds which would later be used to benefit the local economy by estate management, craftsmanship, promotion of trading activities. Buddhism in particular, travelled alongside the maritime trade, promoting coinage, art, and literacy.[138]\n\n\n\n#### Kushan Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kushan Empire\n\nKushan Empire\n![](image)\nKushan territories (full line) and maximum extent of Kushan dominions under Kanishka (dotted line), according to the Rabatak inscription.\n![](image)\nDepiction of the Buddha in Kanishka's coinage, Mathura art, 2nd century CE.\n\nThe Kushan Empire expanded out of what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the Indian subcontinent under the leadership of their first emperor, Kujula Kadphises, about the middle of the 1st century CE. The Kushans were possibly a Tocharian speaking tribe,[139] one of five branches of the Yuezhi confederation.[140][141] By the time of his grandson, Kanishka the Great, the empire spread to encompass much of Afghanistan,[142] and then the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.[143]\n\n\nEmperor Kanishka was a great patron of Buddhism; however, as Kushans expanded southward, the deities of their later coinage came to reflect its new Hindu majority.[144][145] Historian Vincent Smith said about Kanishka:\n\n\n\n\n> He played the part of a second Ashoka in the history of Buddhism.[146]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe empire linked the Indian Ocean maritime trade with the commerce of the Silk Road through the Indus valley, encouraging long-distance trade, particularly between China and Rome. The Kushans brought new trends to the budding and blossoming Gandhara art and Mathura art, which reached its peak during Kushan rule.[147] The period of peace under Kushan rule is known as *Pax Kushana*.\n\n\nBy the 3rd century, their empire in India was disintegrating and their last known great emperor was Vasudeva I.[148][149]\n\n\n\n### Classical period (c. 320 – 650 CE)[edit]\n\n\n#### Gupta Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gupta Empire\n\nFurther information: Meghadūta, Abhijñānaśākuntala, Kumārasambhava, Panchatantra, Aryabhatiya, Indian numerals, and Kama Sutra\n\nGupta Empire\n![](image)\nThe Gupta Empire around 420 CE at its peak territorial extent under Kumaragupta I.\n![](image)\nThe current structure of the Mahabodhi Temple dates to the Gupta era, 5th century CE. Marking the location where the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment.\n\nThe Gupta period was noted for cultural creativity, especially in literature, architecture, sculpture, and painting.[150] The Gupta period produced scholars such as Kalidasa, Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Vishnu Sharma, and Vatsyayana. The Gupta period marked a watershed of Indian culture: the Guptas performed Vedic sacrifices to legitimise their rule, but they also patronised Buddhism, an alternative to Brahmanical orthodoxy. The military exploits of the first three rulers – Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, and Chandragupta II – brought much of India under their leadership.[151] Science and political administration reached new heights during the Gupta era. Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural centre and established it as a base that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions.[152][153] The period of peace under Gupta rule is known as *Pax Gupta*.\n\n\nThe latter Guptas successfully resisted the northwestern kingdoms until the arrival of the Alchon Huns, who established themselves in Afghanistan by the first half of the 5th century CE, with their capital at Bamiyan.[154] However, much of the southern India including Deccan were largely unaffected by these events.[155][156]\n\n\n\n#### Vakataka Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vakataka Empire\n\nThe Vākāṭaka Empire originated from the Deccan in the mid-third century CE. Their state is believed to have extended from the southern edges of Malwa and Gujarat in the north to the Tungabhadra River in the south as well as from the Arabian Sea in the western to the edges of Chhattisgarh in the east. They were the most important successors of the Satavahanas in the Deccan, contemporaneous with the Guptas in northern India and succeeded by the Vishnukundina dynasty.\n\n\nThe Vakatakas are noted for having been patrons of the arts, architecture and literature. The rock-cut Buddhist viharas and chaityas of Ajanta Caves (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) were built under the patronage of Vakataka emperor, Harishena.[157][158]\n\n\n\n* ![The Ajanta Caves are 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monument built under the Vakatakas.](image)\n\nThe Ajanta Caves are 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monument built under the Vakatakas.\n* ![Buddhist monks praying in front of the Dagoba of Chaitya Cave 26 of the Ajanta Caves.](image)\n\nBuddhist monks praying in front of the Dagoba of Chaitya Cave 26 of the Ajanta Caves.\n* ![Buddhist \"Chaitya Griha\" or prayer hall, with a seated Buddha, Cave 26 of the Ajanta Caves.](image)\n\nBuddhist \"Chaitya Griha\" or prayer hall, with a seated Buddha, Cave 26 of the Ajanta Caves.\n* ![Many foreign ambassadors, representatives, and travelers are included as devotees attending the Buddha's descent from Trayastrimsa Heaven; painting from Cave 17 of the Ajanta Caves.](image)\n\nMany foreign ambassadors, representatives, and travelers are included as devotees attending the Buddha's descent from Trayastrimsa Heaven; painting from Cave 17 of the Ajanta Caves.\n\n#### Kamarupa Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kamarupa Kingdom\n\n![](image)Copper Plate Seal of Kamarupa Kings at Madan Kamdev ruins.\nSamudragupta's 4th-century Allahabad pillar inscription mentions Kamarupa (Western Assam)[159] and Davaka (Central Assam)[160] as frontier kingdoms of the Gupta Empire. Davaka was later absorbed by Kamarupa, which grew into a large kingdom that spanned from Karatoya river to near present Sadiya and covered the entire Brahmaputra valley, North Bengal, parts of Bangladesh and, at times Purnea and parts of West Bengal.[161]\n\n\nRuled by three dynasties Varmanas (c. 350–650 CE), Mlechchha dynasty (c. 655–900 CE) and Kamarupa-Palas (c. 900–1100 CE), from their capitals in present-day Guwahati (Pragjyotishpura), Tezpur (Haruppeswara) and North Gauhati (Durjaya) respectively. All three dynasties claimed their descent from Narakasura.[162] In the reign of the Varman king, Bhaskar Varman (c. 600–650 CE), the Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the region and recorded his travels. Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was somewhat extended until c. 1255 CE by the Lunar I (c. 1120–1185 CE) and Lunar II (c. 1155–1255 CE) dynasties.[163] The Kamarupa kingdom came to an end in the middle of the 13th century when the Khen dynasty under Sandhya of Kamarupanagara (North Guwahati), moved his capital to Kamatapur (North Bengal) after the invasion of Muslim Turks, and established the Kamata kingdom.[164]\n\n\n\n#### Pallava Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pallava Empire\n![](image)The Shore Temple (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) at Mahabalipuram built by Narasimhavarman II.The Pallavas, during the 4th to 9th centuries were, alongside the Guptas of the North, great patronisers of Sanskrit development in the South of the Indian subcontinent. The Pallava reign saw the first Sanskrit inscriptions in a script called Grantha.[165] Early Pallavas had different connexions to Southeast Asian countries. The Pallavas used Dravidian architecture to build some very important Hindu temples and academies in Mamallapuram, Kanchipuram and other places; their rule saw the rise of great poets. The practice of dedicating temples to different deities came into vogue followed by fine artistic temple architecture and sculpture style of Vastu Shastra.[166]\n\n\nPallavas reached the height of power during the reign of Mahendravarman I (571–630 CE) and Narasimhavarman I (630–668 CE) and dominated the Telugu and northern parts of the Tamil region until the end of the 9th century.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Kadamba Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kadamba Empire\n\n![](image)Kadamba *shikara* (tower) with *Kalasa* (pinnacle) on top, Doddagaddavalli.\nKadambas originated from Karnataka, was founded by Mayurasharma in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions. King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with help of some native tribes. The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma, a notable ruler with whom the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires, for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties (Kadambas of Goa, Kadambas of Halasi and Kadambas of Hangal).\n\n\n\n#### Empire of Harsha[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Harsha and Pushyabhuti dynasty\n\nHarsha ruled northern India from 606 to 647 CE. He was the son of Prabhakarvardhana and the younger brother of Rajyavardhana, who were members of the Vardhana dynasty and ruled Thanesar, in present-day Haryana.\n\n\n\n![](image)Coin of Emperor Harsha, c. 606–647 CE.[168]\nAfter the downfall of the prior Gupta Empire in the middle of the 6th century, North India reverted to smaller republics and monarchical states. The power vacuum resulted in the rise of the Vardhanas of Thanesar, who began uniting the republics and monarchies from the Punjab to central India. After the death of Harsha's father and brother, representatives of the empire crowned Harsha emperor in April 606 CE, giving him the title of Maharaja.[169] At the height of his power, his Empire covered much of North and Northwestern India, extended East until Kamarupa, and South until Narmada River; and eventually made Kannauj (in present Uttar Pradesh) his capital, and ruled until 647 CE.[170]\n\n\nThe peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a centre of cosmopolitanism, attracting scholars, artists and religious visitors.[170] During this time, Harsha converted to Buddhism from Surya worship.[171] The Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the court of Harsha and wrote a very favourable account of him, praising his justice and generosity.[170] His biography *Harshacharita* (\"Deeds of Harsha\") written by Sanskrit poet Banabhatta, describes his association with Thanesar and the palace with a two-storied *Dhavalagriha* (White Mansion).[172][173]\n\n\n\n## Early medieval period (mid 6th c.–1200 CE)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Medieval India, Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent, and Tripartite Struggle\n\nEarly medieval India began after the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE.[125] This period also covers the \"Late Classical Age\" of Hinduism,[174] which began after the end of the Gupta Empire,[174] and the collapse of the Empire of Harsha in the 7th century CE;[174] the beginning of Imperial Kannauj, leading to the Tripartite struggle; and ended in the 13th century with the rise of the Delhi Sultanate in Northern India[175] and the end of the Later Cholas with the death of Rajendra Chola III in 1279 in Southern India; however some aspects of the Classical period continued until the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in the south around the 17th century.\n\n\nFrom the fifth century to the thirteenth, Śrauta sacrifices declined, and initiatory traditions of Buddhism, Jainism or more commonly Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism expanded in royal courts.[176] This period produced some of India's finest art, considered the epitome of classical development, and the development of the main spiritual and philosophical systems which continued to be in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.\n\n\nIn the 7th century CE, Kumārila Bhaṭṭa formulated his school of Mimamsa philosophy and defended the position on Vedic rituals against Buddhist attacks. Scholars note Bhaṭṭa's contribution to the decline of Buddhism in India.[177] In the 8th century, Adi Shankara travelled across the Indian subcontinent to propagate and spread the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, which he consolidated; and is credited with unifying the main characteristics of the current thoughts in Hinduism.[178][179][180] He was a critic of both Buddhism and Minamsa school of Hinduism;[181][182][183][184] and founded mathas (monasteries) for the spread and development of Advaita Vedanta.[185] Muhammad bin Qasim's invasion of Sindh (modern Pakistan) in 711 CE witnessed further decline of Buddhism.[186]\n\n\nFrom the 8th to the 10th century, three dynasties contested for control of northern India: the Gurjara Pratiharas of Malwa, the Palas of Bengal, and the Rashtrakutas of the Deccan. The Sena dynasty would later assume control of the Pala Empire; the Gurjara Pratiharas fragmented into various states, notably the Paramaras of Malwa, the Chandelas of Bundelkhand, the Kalachuris of Mahakoshal, the Tomaras of Haryana, and the Chauhans of Rajputana, these states were some of the earliest Rajput kingdoms;[187] while the Rashtrakutas were annexed by the Western Chalukyas.[188] During this period, the Chaulukya dynasty emerged; the Chaulukyas constructed the Dilwara Temples, Modhera Sun Temple, Rani ki vav[189] in the style of Māru-Gurjara architecture, and their capital Anhilwara (modern Patan, Gujarat) was one of the largest cities in the Indian subcontinent, with the population estimated at 100,000 in 1000 CE.\n\n\nThe Chola Empire emerged as a major power during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I who successfully invaded parts of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka in the 11th century.[190] Lalitaditya Muktapida (r. 724–760 CE) was an emperor of the Kashmiri Karkoṭa dynasty, which exercised influence in northwestern India from 625 CE until 1003, and was followed by Lohara dynasty. Kalhana in his Rajatarangini credits king Lalitaditya with leading an aggressive military campaign in Northern India and Central Asia.[191][192][193]\n\n\nThe Hindu Shahi dynasty ruled portions of eastern Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, and Kashmir from the mid-7th century to the early 11th century. While in Odisha, the Eastern Ganga Empire rose to power; noted for the advancement of Hindu architecture, most notable being Jagannath Temple and Konark Sun Temple, as well as being patrons of art and literature.\n\n\n\n* ![Martand Sun Temple Central shrine, dedicated to the deity Surya, and built by the third ruler of the Karkota dynasty, Lalitaditya Muktapida, in the 8th century CE.](image)\n\nMartand Sun Temple Central shrine, dedicated to the deity Surya, and built by the third ruler of the Karkota dynasty, Lalitaditya Muktapida, in the 8th century CE.\n* ![Konark Sun Temple at Konark, Orissa, built by Narasimhadeva I (1238–1264 CE) of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.](image)\n\nKonark Sun Temple at Konark, Orissa, built by Narasimhadeva I (1238–1264 CE) of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.\n* ![Kandariya Mahadeva Temple in the Khajuraho complex was built by the Chandelas.](image)\n\nKandariya Mahadeva Temple in the Khajuraho complex was built by the Chandelas.\n* ![Jagannath Temple at Puri, built by Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.](image)\n\nJagannath Temple at Puri, built by Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.\n\n### Chalukya Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chalukya Empire\n\nThe Chalukya Empire ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries, as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \"Badami Chalukyas\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \"Chalukyan architecture\". The Chalukya dynasty ruled parts of southern and central India from Badami in Karnataka between 550 and 750, and then again from Kalyani between 970 and 1190.\n\n\n\n* ![Galaganatha Temple at Pattadakal complex (UNESCO World Heritage) is an example of Badami Chalukya architecture.](image)\n\nGalaganatha Temple at Pattadakal complex (UNESCO World Heritage) is an example of Badami Chalukya architecture.\n* ![Bhutanatha temple complex at Badami, next to a waterfall, during the monsoon.](image)\n\nBhutanatha temple complex at Badami, next to a waterfall, during the monsoon.\n* ![Vishnu image inside the Badami Cave Temple Complex.

Amoghavarsha was also an author and wrote Kavirajamarga, the earliest known Kannada work on poetics.[195][199] Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest example of which is seen in the Kailasanath Temple at Ellora. Other important contributions are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka.\n\n\nThe Arab traveller Suleiman described the Rashtrakuta Empire as one of the four great Empires of the world.[200] The Rashtrakuta period marked the beginning of the golden age of southern Indian mathematics. The great south Indian mathematician Mahāvīra had a huge impact on medieval south Indian mathematicians.[201] The Rashtrakuta rulers also patronised men of letters in a variety of languages.[195]\n\n\n\n* ![Kailasa temple, is one of the largest rock-cut ancient Hindu temples located in Ellora.](image)\n\nKailasa temple, is one of the largest rock-cut ancient Hindu temples located in Ellora.\n* ![Shikhara of Indra Sabha at Ellora Caves.](image)\n\nShikhara of Indra Sabha at Ellora Caves.\n* ![Statue of the Buddha seated.

Nagabhata I defeated the Arab army under Junaid and Tamin during the Umayyad campaigns in India.[202] Under Nagabhata II, the Gurjara-Pratiharas became the most powerful dynasty in northern India. He was succeeded by his son Ramabhadra, who ruled briefly before being succeeded by his son, Mihira Bhoja. Under Bhoja and his successor Mahendrapala I, the Pratihara Empire reached its peak of prosperity and power. By the time of Mahendrapala, its territory stretched from the border of Sindh in the west to Bihar in the east and from the Himalayas in the north to around the Narmada River in the south.[203] The expansion triggered a tripartite power struggle with the Rashtrakuta and Pala empires for control of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\nBy the end of the 10th century, several feudatories of the empire took advantage of the temporary weakness of the Gurjara-Pratiharas to declare their independence, notably the Paramaras of Malwa, the Chandelas of Bundelkhand, the Tomaras of Haryana, the Chauhans of Rajputana,[204] and the Kalachuris of Mahakoshal.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* ![One of the four entrances of the Teli ka Mandir.

Their capital was located at Varanasi.[206]\n\n\n\n### Khayaravala dynasty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Khayaravala dynasty\n\nThe Khayaravala dynasty, ruled parts of the present-day Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand, during 11th and 12th centuries. Their capital was located at Khayaragarh in Shahabad district. Pratapdhavala and Shri Pratapa were king of the dynasty.[207]\n\n![](image)Rohtasgarh Fort\n### Pala Empire[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Excavated ruins of Nalanda, a centre of Buddhist learning from 450 to 1193 CE.\nMain article: Pala Empire\n\nThe Pala Empire was founded by Gopala I.[208][209][210] It was ruled by a Buddhist dynasty from Bengal. The Palas reunified Bengal after the fall of Shashanka's Gauda Kingdom.[211]\n\n\nThe Palas were followers of the Mahayana and Tantric schools of Buddhism,[212] they also patronised Shaivism and Vaishnavism.[213] The empire reached its peak under Dharmapala and Devapala. Dharmapala is believed to have conquered Kanauj and extended his sway up to the farthest limits of India in the northwest.[213]\n\n\nThe Pala Empire can be considered as the golden era of Bengal.[214] Dharmapala founded the Vikramashila and revived Nalanda,[213] considered one of the first great universities in recorded history. Nalanda reached its height under the patronage of the Pala Empire.[214][215] The Palas also built many viharas. They maintained close cultural and commercial ties with countries of Southeast Asia and Tibet. Sea trade added greatly to the prosperity of the Pala Empire.\n\n\n\n### Cholas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chola dynasty\n\n![](image)Chola Empire under Rajendra Chola, c. 1030 CE.\nMedieval Cholas rose to prominence during the middle of the 9th century CE and established the greatest empire South India had seen.[216] They successfully united the South India under their rule and through their naval strength extended their influence in the Southeast Asian countries such as Srivijaya.[190] Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra Chola I, Rajadhiraja Chola, Virarajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola I the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia.[217][218] Rajendra Chola I's navies occupied the sea coasts from Burma to Vietnam,[219] the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Lakshadweep (Laccadive) islands, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula. The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by the occupation of cities of the maritime empire of Srivijaya in Southeast Asia, as well as by the repeated embassies to China.[220]\n\n\nThey dominated the political affairs of Sri Lanka for over two centuries through repeated invasions and occupation. They also had continuing trade contacts with the Arabs and the Chinese empire.[221] Rajaraja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola I gave political unity to the whole of Southern India and established the Chola Empire as a respected sea power.[222] Under the Cholas, the South India reached new heights of excellence in art, religion and literature. In all of these spheres, the Chola period marked the culmination of movements that had begun in an earlier age under the Pallavas. Monumental architecture in the form of majestic temples and sculpture in stone and bronze reached a finesse never before achieved in India.[223]\n\n\n\n![](image)Srirangam Ranganathaswamy Temple is the world's largest functioning Hindu temple.[224] present in Tamil Nadu, India. The temple is a significant archaeological and epigraphical site, providing a historic window into the early and mid medieval South Indian society and culture. The temple is mentioned in the Ramayana,[225] Mahabharatha, Sangam literature(500 BCE to the 300 CE[226])and Various books. Beyond the ancient textual history, archaeological evidence such as inscriptions refer to this temple, and these stone inscriptions are from late **100 BCE to 100 CE**.[*citation needed*] Hence, making it one of the oldest surviving active temple complexes in South India.\n* ![The granite gopuram (tower) of Brihadeeswarar Temple, 1010 CE.](image)\n\nThe granite gopuram (tower) of Brihadeeswarar Temple, 1010 CE.\n* ![Chariot detail at Airavatesvara Temple built by Rajaraja Chola II in the 12th century CE.](image)\n\nChariot detail at Airavatesvara Temple built by Rajaraja Chola II in the 12th century CE.\n* ![The pyramidal structure above the sanctum at Brihadisvara Temple.](image)\n\nThe pyramidal structure above the sanctum at Brihadisvara Temple.\n* ![Brihadeeswara Temple Entrance Gopurams at Thanjavur.](image)\n\nBrihadeeswara Temple Entrance Gopurams at Thanjavur.\n\n### Western Chalukya Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Chalukya Empire\n\nThe Western Chalukya Empire ruled most of the western Deccan, South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries.[227] Vast areas between the Narmada River in the north and Kaveri River in the south came under Chalukya control.[227] During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuris, were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the latter half of the 12th century.[228]\n\n\nThe Western Chalukyas developed an architectural style known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali, Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri, and the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi.[229] This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language of Kannada, and Sanskrit like the philosopher and statesman Basava and the great mathematician Bhāskara II.[230][231]\n\n\n\n* ![Shrine outer wall and Dravida style superstructure (shikhara) at Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri.](image)\n\nShrine outer wall and *Dravida* style superstructure (*shikhara*) at Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri.\n* ![Ornate entrance to the closed hall from the south at Kalleshvara Temple at Bagali.](image)\n\nOrnate entrance to the closed hall from the south at Kalleshvara Temple at Bagali.\n* ![Shrine wall relief, molding frieze and miniature decorative tower in Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti.](image)\n\nShrine wall relief, molding frieze and miniature decorative tower in Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti.\n* ![Rear view showing lateral entrances of the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi.](image)\n\nRear view showing lateral entrances of the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi.\n\n## Late medieval period (c. 1200–1526 CE)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medieval India\n\nSee also: Muslim kingdoms in the Indian subcontinent\n\nThe late medieval period is marked by repeated invasions of the Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans,[232][233] the rule of the Delhi sultanate, and by the growth of other dynasties and empires, built upon military technology of the Sultanate.[234]\n\n\n\n### Delhi Sultanate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Delhi Sultanate\n\n![](image)The Delhi Sultanate reached its zenith under the Turko-Indian Tughlaq dynasty.[235]\nThe Delhi Sultanate was a series of successive Islamic states based in Delhi, ruled by several dynasties of Turkic, Turko-Indian[236] and Pashtun origins.[237] It ruled large parts of the Indian subcontinent from the 13th to the early 16th century.[238] In the 12th and 13th centuries, Central Asian Turks invaded parts of northern India and established the Delhi Sultanate in the former Hindu holdings.[239] The subsequent Mamluk dynasty of Delhi managed to conquer large areas of northern India, while the Khalji dynasty conquered most of central India while forcing the principal Hindu kingdoms of South India to become vassal states.[238]\n\n\nThe Sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting \"Indo-Muslim\" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of Urdu was born during the Delhi Sultanate period. The Delhi Sultanate is the only Indo-Islamic empire to enthrone one of the few female rulers in India, Razia Sultana (1236–1240).\n\n\nWhile initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system, drawing India into a wider international network, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society.[240] However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large-scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent.[241]\n\n\nThe Mongol invasions of India were successfully repelled by the Delhi Sultanate during the rule of Alauddin Khalji. A major factor in their success was their Turkic Mamluk slave army, who were highly skilled in the same style of nomadic cavalry warfare as the Mongols. It is possible that the Mongol Empire may have expanded into India were it not for the Delhi Sultanate's role in repelling them.[242] By repeatedly repulsing the Mongol raiders, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[243][242]\n\n\nA Turco-Mongol conqueror in Central Asia, Timur (Tamerlane), attacked the reigning Sultan Nasir-u Din Mehmud of the Tughlaq dynasty in the north Indian city of Delhi.[244] The Sultan's army was defeated on 17 December 1398. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins after Timur's army had killed and plundered for three days and nights. He ordered the whole city to be sacked except for the sayyids, scholars, and the \"other Muslims\" (artists); 100,000 war prisoners were put to death in one day.[245] The Sultanate suffered significantly from the sacking of Delhi. Though revived briefly under the Lodi dynasty, it was but a shadow of the former.\n\n\n\n* ![Qutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, whose construction was begun by Qutb ud-Din Aibak, the first Sultan of Delhi.](image)\n\nQutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, whose construction was begun by Qutb ud-Din Aibak, the first Sultan of Delhi.\n* ![Dargahs of Sufi-saint Nizamuddin Auliya, and poet and musician Amir Khusro in Delhi.](image)\n\nDargahs of Sufi-saint Nizamuddin Auliya, and poet and musician Amir Khusro in Delhi.\n* ![The grave of Razia, the Sultana of Delhi, from 1236 CE to 1240 CE, the only female ruler of a major realm on the Indian subcontinent until modern times.[citation needed]](image)\n\nThe grave of Razia, the Sultana of Delhi, from 1236 CE to 1240 CE, the only female ruler of a major realm on the Indian subcontinent until modern times.[*citation needed*]\n* ![Mausoleum of Ghiyasuddin Tughluq in Tughluqabad.](image)\n\nMausoleum of Ghiyasuddin Tughluq in Tughluqabad.\n* ![Lodhi Gardens in Delhi.](image)\n\nLodhi Gardens in Delhi.\n\n### Vijayanagara Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vijayanagara Empire\n\n![](image)Map of the Sangama dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire\nThe Vijayanagara Empire was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty,[246] which originated as a political heir of the Hoysala Empire, Kakatiya Empire,[247] and the Pandyan Empire.[248] The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the south Indian powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India.[249]\n\n\nIn the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of *Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara* (\"master of the eastern and western seas\"). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of Arcot, the Reddys of Kondavidu, and the Sultan of Madurai and had gained control over Goa in the west and the Tungabhadra-Krishna doab in the north.[250][251]\n\n\nHarihara II, the second son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the kingdom beyond the Krishna River and brought the whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella.[252] The next ruler, Deva Raya I, emerged successful against the Gajapatis of Odisha and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation.[253] Italian traveler Niccolo de Conti wrote of him as the most powerful ruler of India.[254] Deva Raya II succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was possibly the most capable of the Sangama Dynasty rulers.[255] He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the Zamorin of Calicut and Quilon in the south. He invaded the island of Sri Lanka and became overlord of the kings of Burma at Pegu and Tanasserim.[256][257][258]\n\n\nThe Vijayanagara Emperors were tolerant of all religions and sects, as writings by foreign visitors show.[259] The kings used titles such as *Gobrahamana Pratipalanacharya* (*literally*, \"protector of cows and Brahmins\") and *Hindurayasuratrana* (*lit*, \"upholder of Hindu faith\") that testified to their intention of protecting Hinduism and yet were at the same time staunchly Islamicate in their court ceremonials and dress.[260] The empire's founders, Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, were devout Shaivas (worshippers of Shiva), but made grants to the Vaishnava order of Sringeri with Vidyaranya as their patron saint, and designated *Varaha* (an avatar of Vishnu) as their emblem.[261] Nobles from Central Asia's Timurid kingdoms also came to Vijayanagara.[262] The later Saluva and Tuluva kings were Vaishnava by faith, but worshipped at the feet of Lord Virupaksha (Shiva) at Hampi as well as Lord Venkateshwara (Vishnu) at Tirupati.[263] A Sanskrit work, *Jambavati Kalyanam* by King Krishnadevaraya, called Lord Virupaksha *Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani* (\"protective jewel of Karnata Empire\").[264] The kings patronised the saints of the dvaita order (philosophy of dualism) of Madhvacharya at Udupi.[265]\n\n\n\n* ![An 1868 photograph of the ruins of the Vijayanagara Empire at Hampi, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site[266]](image)\n\nAn 1868 photograph of the ruins of the Vijayanagara Empire at Hampi, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site[266]\n* ![Gajashaala or elephant's stable, built by the Vijayanagar rulers for their war elephants.[267]](image)\n\n*Gajashaala* or elephant's stable, built by the Vijayanagar rulers for their war elephants.[267]\n* ![Vijayanagara marketplace at Hampi, along with the sacred tank located on the side of Krishna temple](image)\n\nVijayanagara marketplace at Hampi, along with the sacred tank located on the side of Krishna temple\n* ![Stone temple car in Vitthala Temple at Hampi](image)\n\nStone temple car in Vitthala Temple at Hampi\n\nThe empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of Hindu temple construction. South Indian mathematics flourished under the protection of the Vijayanagara Empire in Kerala. The south Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama founded the famous Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics in the 14th century which produced a lot of great south Indian mathematicians like Parameshvara, Nilakantha Somayaji and Jyeṣṭhadeva.[268] Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation.[269] The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form.[270]\n\n\nVijayanagara went into decline after the defeat in the Battle of Talikota (1565). After the death of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the destroyed Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire.[271] Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life until his death in 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others.[272][273][274] During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka, Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee – all of which declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries.[272]\n\n\n\n### Other kingdoms[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Guhila dynasty and Kingdom of Mewar\n\n* ![Vijaya Stambha (Tower of Victory)](image)\n\n*Vijaya Stambha* (Tower of Victory)\n* ![Temple inside Chittorgarh fort](image)\n\nTemple inside Chittorgarh fort\n* ![The Man Singh (Manasimha) palace at the Gwalior fort](image)\n\nThe Man Singh (Manasimha) palace at the Gwalior fort\n* ![Chinese manuscript Tribute Giraffe with Attendant, depicting a giraffe presented by Bengali envoys in the name of Sultan Saifuddin Hamza Shah of Bengal to the Yongle Emperor of Ming China.](image)\n\nChinese manuscript *Tribute Giraffe with Attendant*, depicting a giraffe presented by Bengali envoys in the name of Sultan Saifuddin Hamza Shah of Bengal to the Yongle Emperor of Ming China.\n* ![Mahmud Gawan Madrasa was built by Mahmud Gawan, the Wazir of the Bahmani Sultanate as the centre of religious as well as secular education.](image)\n\nMahmud Gawan Madrasa was built by Mahmud Gawan, the Wazir of the Bahmani Sultanate as the centre of religious as well as secular education.\n* ![15th century copper plate grant of Gajapati king Purushottama Deva](image)\n\n15th century copper plate grant of Gajapati king Purushottama Deva\n\nFor two and a half centuries from the mid-13th century, politics in Northern India was dominated by the Delhi Sultanate, and in Southern India by the Vijayanagar Empire. However, there were other regional powers present as well. After fall of Pala Empire, the Chero dynasty ruled much of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand from 12th CE to 18th CE.[275][276][277] The Reddy dynasty successfully defeated the Delhi Sultanate and extended their rule from Cuttack in the north to Kanchi in the south, eventually being absorbed into the expanding Vijayanagara Empire.[278]\n\n\nIn the north, the Rajput kingdoms remained the dominant force in Western and Central India. The Mewar dynasty under Maharana Hammir defeated and captured Muhammad Tughlaq with the Bargujars as his main allies. Tughlaq had to pay a huge ransom and relinquish all of Mewar's lands. After this event, the Delhi Sultanate did not attack Chittor for a few hundred years. The Rajputs re-established their independence, and Rajput states were established as far east as Bengal and north into the Punjab. The Tomaras established themselves at Gwalior, and Man Singh Tomar reconstructed the Gwalior Fort.[279] During this period, Mewar emerged as the leading Rajput state; and Rana Kumbha expanded his kingdom at the expense of the Sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat.[279][280] The next great Rajput ruler, Rana Sanga of Mewar, became the principal player in Northern India. His objectives grew in scope – he planned to conquer Delhi. But, his defeat in the Battle of Khanwa consolidated the new Mughal dynasty in India.[279] The Mewar dynasty under Maharana Udai Singh II faced further defeat by Mughal emperor Akbar, with their capital Chittor being captured. Due to this event, Udai Singh II founded Udaipur, which became the new capital of the Mewar kingdom. His son, Maharana Pratap of Mewar, firmly resisted the Mughals. Akbar sent many missions against him. He survived to ultimately gain control of all of Mewar, excluding the Chittor Fort.[281]\n\n\nIn the south, the Bahmani Sultanate was the chief rival of the Vijayanagara, and frequently created difficulties for the Vijayanagara.[282] In the early 16th century Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagar Empire defeated the last remnant of Bahmani Sultanate power,[283] resulting it being split into five small Deccan sultanates.[284] In 1490, Ahmadnagar declared independence, followed by Bijapur and Berar in the same year; Golkonda became independent in 1518 and Bidar in 1528.[285] Although generally rivals, they did ally against the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, permanently weakening Vijayanagar in the Battle of Talikota.\n\n\nIn the East, the Gajapati Kingdom remained a strong regional power to reckon with, associated with a high point in the growth of regional culture and architecture. Under Kapilendradeva, Gajapatis became an empire stretching from the lower Ganga in the north to the Kaveri in the south.[286] In Northeast India, the Ahom Kingdom was a major power for six centuries;[287][288] led by Lachit Borphukan, the Ahoms decisively defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Saraighat during the Ahom-Mughal conflicts.[289] Further east in Northeastern India was the Kingdom of Manipur, which ruled from their seat of power at Kangla Fort and developed a sophisticated Hindu Gaudiya Vaishnavite culture.[290][291][292]\n\n\nThe Sultanate of Bengal was the dominant power of the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, with a network of mint towns spread across the region. It was a Sunni Muslim monarchy with Indo-Turkic, Arab, Abyssinian and Bengali Muslim elites. The sultanate was known for its religious pluralism where non-Muslim communities co-existed peacefully. The Bengal Sultanate had a circle of vassal states, including Odisha in the southwest, Arakan in the southeast, and Tripura in the east. In the early 16th century, the Bengal Sultanate reached the peak of its territorial growth with control over Kamrup and Kamata in the northeast and Jaunpur and Bihar in the west. It was reputed as a thriving trading nation and one of Asia's strongest states. The Bengal Sultanate was described by contemporary European and Chinese visitors as a relatively prosperous kingdom and the \"richest country to trade with\". The Bengal Sultanate left a strong architectural legacy. Buildings from the period show foreign influences merged into a distinct Bengali style. The Bengal Sultanate was also the largest and most prestigious authority among the independent medieval Muslim-ruled states in the history of Bengal. Its decline began with an interregnum by the Suri Empire, followed by Mughal conquest and disintegration into petty kingdoms.\n\n\n\n### Bhakti movement and Sikhism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bhakti movement, Buddhism in India, and Sikhism\n\nSee also: History of Sikhism\n\n![](image)The Dasam Granth (above) was composed by Sikh Guru Gobind Singh.\nThe Bhakti movement refers to the theistic devotional trend that emerged in medieval Hinduism[293] and later revolutionised in Sikhism.[294] It originated in the seventh-century south India (now parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and spread northwards.[293] It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE.[295]\n\n\n\n* The Bhakti movement regionally developed around different gods and goddesses, such as Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism (Shakti goddesses), and Smartism.[296][297][298] The movement was inspired by many poet-saints, who championed a wide range of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism of Dvaita to absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta.[299][300]\n* Sikhism is a monotheistic and panentheistic religion based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak, the first Guru,[301] and the ten successive Sikh gurus. After the death of the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, the Sikh scripture, Guru Granth Sahib, became the literal embodiment of the eternal, impersonal Guru, where the scripture's word serves as the spiritual guide for Sikhs.[302][303][304]\n* Buddhism in India flourished in the Himalayan kingdoms of Namgyal Kingdom in Ladakh, Sikkim Kingdom in Sikkim, and Chutia Kingdom in Arunachal Pradesh of the Late medieval period.\n\n\n* ![Rang Ghar, built by Pramatta Singha in Ahom kingdom's capital Rangpur, is one of the earliest pavilions of outdoor stadia in the Indian subcontinent.](image)\n\nRang Ghar, built by Pramatta Singha in Ahom kingdom's capital Rangpur, is one of the earliest pavilions of outdoor stadia in the Indian subcontinent.\n* ![Chittor Fort is the largest fort on the Indian subcontinent; it is one of the six Hill Forts of Rajasthan.](image)\n\nChittor Fort is the largest fort on the Indian subcontinent; it is one of the six Hill Forts of Rajasthan.\n* ![Ranakpur Jain temple was built in the 15th century with the support of the Rajput state of Mewar.](image)\n\nRanakpur Jain temple was built in the 15th century with the support of the Rajput state of Mewar.\n* ![Gol Gumbaz built by the Bijapur Sultanate, has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia.](image)\n\nGol Gumbaz built by the Bijapur Sultanate, has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia.\n\n## Early modern period (c. 1526–1858 CE)[edit]\n\n\nThe early modern period of Indian history is dated from 1526 CE to 1858 CE, corresponding to the rise and fall of the Mughal Empire, which inherited from the Timurid Renaissance. During this age India's economy expanded, relative peace was maintained and arts were patronized. This period witnessed the further development of Indo-Islamic architecture;[305][306] the growth of Marathas and Sikhs enabled them to rule significant regions of India in the waning days of the Mughal empire.[14] With the discovery of the Cape route in the 1500s, the first Europeans to arrive by sea and establish themselves, were the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay.[307]\n\n\n\n### Mughal Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mughal Empire\n\nSee also: Bengal Subah, Muslin trade in Bengal, Mughal architecture, Army of the Mughal Empire, Mughal clothing, and Mughal painting\n\nMughal Empire\n![](image)\nA map of the Mughal Empire at its greatest geographical extent, c. 1700 CE\n![](image)\n\"The Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.\" UNESCO World Heritage Site declaration, 1983.[308]\n\nIn 1526, Babur swept across the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal Empire, which at its zenith covered much of South Asia.[309] However, his son Humayun was defeated by the Afghan warrior Sher Shah Suri in 1540, and Humayun was forced to retreat to Kabul. After Sher Shah's death, his son Islam Shah Suri and his Hindu general Hemu Vikramaditya established secular rule in North India from Delhi until 1556, when Akbar (r. 1556–1605), grandson of Babur, defeated Hemu in the Second Battle of Panipat on 6 November 1556 after winning Battle of Delhi. Akbar tried to establish a good relationship with the Hindus. Akbar declared \"Amari\" or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism. He rolled back the *jizya* tax for non-Muslims. The Mughal emperors married local royalty, allied themselves with local *maharajas*, and attempted to fuse their Turko-Persian culture with ancient Indian styles, creating a unique Indo-Persian culture and Indo-Saracenic architecture.\n\n\nAkbar married a Rajput princess, Mariam-uz-Zamani, and they had a son, Jahangir (r. 1605–1627).[310] Jahangir followed his father's policy. The Mughal dynasty ruled most of the Indian subcontinent by 1600. The reign of Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) was the golden age of Mughal architecture. He erected several large monuments, the most famous of which is the Taj Mahal at Agra.\n\n\nIt was one of the largest empires to have existed in the Indian subcontinent,[311] and surpassed China to become the world's largest economic power, controlling 24.4% of the world economy,[312] and the world leader in manufacturing,[313] producing 25% of global industrial output.[314] The economic and demographic upsurge was stimulated by Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production,[315] and a relatively high degree of urbanisation.[316]\n\n\n\nOther Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n* ![The Agra Fort showing the river Yamuna and the Taj Mahal in the background](image)\n\nThe Agra Fort showing the river Yamuna and the Taj Mahal in the background\n* ![Fatehpur Sikri, near Agra, showing Buland Darwaza, the complex built by Akbar, the third Mughal emperor.](image)\n\nFatehpur Sikri, near Agra, showing Buland Darwaza, the complex built by Akbar, the third Mughal emperor.\n* ![Humayun's Tomb in Delhi, built in 1570 CE.](image)\n\nHumayun's Tomb in Delhi, built in 1570 CE.\n* ![The Red Fort, Delhi, its construction begun in 1639 CE, and ended in 1648 CE.](image)\n\nThe Red Fort, Delhi, its construction begun in 1639 CE, and ended in 1648 CE.\n\nThe Mughal Empire reached the zenith of its territorial expanse during the reign of Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707), under whose reign the proto-industrialization[317] led to India surpassing Qing China as the world's largest economy.[318][319] Aurangzeb was less tolerant than his predecessors, reintroducing the *jizya* tax and destroying several historical temples, while at the same time building more Hindu temples than he destroyed,[320] employing significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors, and advancing administrators based on ability rather than religion.[321] However, he is often blamed for the erosion of the tolerant syncretic tradition of his predecessors, as well as increasing religious controversy and centralisation. The English East India Company suffered a defeat in the Anglo-Mughal War.[322][323]\n\n\n\n![](image)18th-century political formation in India\nThe Mughals suffered several blows due to invasions from Marathas, Rajputs, Jats and Afghans. In 1737, the Maratha general Bajirao of the Maratha Empire invaded and plundered Delhi. Under the general Amir Khan Umrao Al Udat, the Mughal Emperor sent 8,000 troops to drive away the 5,000 Maratha cavalry soldiers. Baji Rao easily routed the novice Mughal general. In 1737, in the final defeat of Mughal Empire, the commander-in-chief of the Mughal Army, Nizam-ul-mulk, was routed at Bhopal by the Maratha army. This essentially brought an end to the Mughal Empire. While Bharatpur State under Jat ruler Suraj Mal, overran the Mughal garrison at Agra and plundered the city.[324] In 1739, Nader Shah, emperor of Iran, defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Karnal.[325] After this victory, Nader captured and sacked Delhi, carrying away treasures including the Peacock Throne.[326] Mughal rule was further weakened by constant native Indian resistance; Banda Singh Bahadur led the Sikh Khalsa against Mughal religious oppression; Hindu Rajas of Bengal, Pratapaditya and Raja Sitaram Ray revolted; and Maharaja Chhatrasal, of Bundela Rajputs, fought the Mughals and established the Panna State.[327] The Mughal dynasty was reduced to puppet rulers by 1757. Vadda Ghalughara took place under the Muslim provincial government based at Lahore to wipe out the Sikhs, with 30,000 Sikhs being killed, an offensive that had begun with the Mughals, with the Chhota Ghallughara,[328] and lasted several decades under its Muslim successor states.[329]\n\n\n\n### Maratha Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Maratha Empire\n\nFurther information: Maratha Army, Maratha Navy, and Battles involving the Maratha Empire\n\nMaratha Empire\n![](image)\nMaratha Empire at its zenith in 1760 (yellow area), covering much of the Indian subcontinent, stretching from South India to present-day Pakistan.\n![](image)\nShaniwarwada palace fort in Pune, the seat of the Peshwa rulers of the Maratha Empire until 1818.\n\nThe Maratha kingdom was founded and consolidated by Chatrapati Shivaji.[330] However, the credit for making the Marathas formidable power nationally goes to *Peshwa* (chief minister) Bajirao I. Historian K.K. Datta wrote that Bajirao I \"may very well be regarded as the second founder of the Maratha Empire\".[331]\n\n\nIn the early 18th century, under the Peshwas, the Marathas consolidated and ruled over much of South Asia. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending Mughal rule in India.[332][333][334] In 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in their capital, in the Battle of Delhi. The Marathas continued their military campaigns against the Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and the Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. By 1760, the domain of the Marathas stretched across most of the Indian subcontinent.[*citation needed*] The Marathas even attempted to capture Delhi and discussed putting Vishwasrao Peshwa on the throne there in place of the Mughal emperor.[335]\n\n\nThe Maratha empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south,[336] to Peshawar (modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan[337] [note 2]) in the north, and Bengal in the east. The Northwestern expansion of the Marathas was stopped after the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). However, the Maratha authority in the north was re-established within a decade under Peshwa Madhavrao I.[339]\n\n\nUnder Madhavrao I, the strongest knights were granted semi-autonomy, creating a confederacy of United Maratha states under the Gaekwads of Baroda, the Holkars of Indore and Malwa, the Scindias of Gwalior and Ujjain, the Bhonsales of Nagpur and the Puars of Dhar and Dewas. In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune, which led to the First Anglo-Maratha War, resulting in a Maratha victory.[340] The Marathas remained a major power in India until their defeat in the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha Wars (1805–1818).\n\n\n\n### Sikh Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sikh Empire\n\nSee also: Sikh architecture and Sikh Khalsa Army\n\nSikh Empire under Ranjit Singh\n![](image)\nThe Sikh empire at its greatest geographical extent, ca. 1839\n![](image)\nThe Harmandir Sahib is the preeminent pilgrimage site of Sikhism. Ranjit Singh rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, overlaid the sanctum with gold foil in 1830.[341]\n\nThe Sikh Empire was a political entity that governed the Northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent, based around the Punjab region, from 1799 to 1849. It was forged, on the foundations of the Khalsa, under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh consolidated much of northern India into an empire using his Sikh Khalsa Army, trained in European military techniques and equipped with modern military technologies. Ranjit Singh proved himself to be a master strategist and selected well-qualified generals for his army. He successfully ended the Afghan-Sikh Wars. In stages, he added central Punjab, the provinces of Multan and Kashmir, and the Peshawar Valley to his empire.[342][343]\n\n\nAt its peak in the 19th century, the empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Sindh in the south, running along Sutlej river to Himachal in the east. After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire weakened, leading to conflict with the British East India Company. The First Anglo-Sikh War and Second Anglo-Sikh War marked the downfall of the Sikh Empire, making it among the last areas of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by the British.\n\n\n\n### Other kingdoms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Territories of India in 1763\nThe Kingdom of Mysore in southern India expanded to its greatest extent under Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan in the later half of the 18th century. Under their rule, Mysore fought series of wars against the Marathas and British or their combined forces. The Maratha–Mysore War ended in April 1787, following the finalizing of *treaty of Gajendragad*, in which Tipu Sultan was obligated to pay tribute to the Marathas. Concurrently, the Anglo-Mysore Wars took place, where the Mysoreans used the Mysorean rockets. The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798–1799) saw the death of Tipu. Mysore's alliance with the French was seen as a threat to the British East India Company, and Mysore was attacked from all four sides. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas launched an invasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory at the Siege of Seringapatam (1799).\n\n\nHyderabad was founded by the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda in 1591. Following a brief Mughal rule, Asif Jah, a Mughal official, seized control of Hyderabad and declared himself Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad in 1724. The Nizams lost considerable territory and paid tribute to the Maratha Empire after being routed in multiple battles, such as the Battle of Palkhed.[344] However, the Nizams maintained their sovereignty from 1724 until 1948 through paying tributes to the Marathas, and later, being vassels of the British. Hyderabad State became a princely state in British India in 1798.\n\n\nThe Nawabs of Bengal had become the de facto rulers of Bengal following the decline of Mughal Empire. However, their rule was interrupted by Marathas who carried out six expeditions in Bengal from 1741 to 1748, as a result of which Bengal became a tributary state of Marathas. On 23 June 1757, Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal was betrayed in the Battle of Plassey by Mir Jafar. He lost to the British, who took over the charge of Bengal in 1757, installed Mir Jafar on the *Masnad* (throne) and established itself to a political power in Bengal.[345] In 1765 the system of Dual Government was established, in which the Nawabs ruled on behalf of the British and were mere puppets to the British. In 1772 the system was abolished and Bengal was brought under the direct control of the British. In 1793, when the *Nizamat* (governorship) of the Nawab was also taken away, they remained as mere pensioners of the British East India Company.[346][347]\n\n\nIn the 18th century, the whole of Rajputana was virtually subdued by the Marathas. The Second Anglo-Maratha War distracted the Marathas from 1807 to 1809, but afterward Maratha domination of Rajputana resumed. In 1817, the British went to war with the Pindaris, raiders who were fled in Maratha territory, which quickly became the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and the British government offered its protection to the Rajput rulers from the Pindaris and the Marathas. By the end of 1818 similar treaties had been executed between the other Rajput states and Britain. The Maratha Sindhia ruler of Gwalior gave up the district of Ajmer-Merwara to the British, and Maratha influence in Rajasthan came to an end.[348] Most of the Rajput princes remained loyal to Britain in the Revolt of 1857, and few political changes were made in Rajputana until Indian independence in 1947. The Rajputana Agency contained more than 20 princely states, most notable being Udaipur State, Jaipur State, Bikaner State and Jodhpur State.\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Maratha Empire, many Maratha dynasties and states became vassals in a subsidiary alliance with the British. With the decline of the Sikh Empire, after the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, under the terms of the Treaty of Amritsar, the British government sold Kashmir to Maharaja Gulab Singh and the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, the second-largest princely state in British India, was created by the Dogra dynasty.[349][350] While in Eastern and Northeastern India, the Hindu and Buddhist states of Cooch Behar Kingdom, Twipra Kingdom and Kingdom of Sikkim were annexed by the British and made vassal princely state.\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Polygar states emerged in Southern India; and managed to weather invasions and flourished until the Polygar Wars, where they were defeated by the British East India Company forces.[351] Around the 18th century, the Kingdom of Nepal was formed by Rajput rulers.[352]\n\n\n\n### European exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial India\n\n![](image)The route followed in Vasco da Gama's first voyage (1497–1499).\nIn 1498, a Portuguese fleet under Vasco da Gama discovered a new sea route from Europe to India, which paved the way for direct Indo-European commerce. The Portuguese soon set up trading posts in Velha Goa, Damaon, Dio island, and Bombay. The Portuguese instituted the Goa Inquisition, where new Indian converts were punished for suspected heresy against Christianity and non-Christians were condemned.[353] Goa remained the main Portuguese territory until it was annexed by India in 1961.[354]\n\n\nThe next to arrive were the Dutch, with their main base in Ceylon. They established ports in Malabar. However, their expansion into India was halted after their defeat in the Battle of Colachel by the Kingdom of Travancore during the Travancore-Dutch War. The Dutch never recovered from the defeat and no longer posed a large colonial threat to India.[355][356]\n\n\nThe internal conflicts among Indian kingdoms gave opportunities to the European traders to gradually establish political influence and appropriate lands. Following the Dutch, the British—who set up in the west coast port of Surat in 1619—and the French both established trading outposts in India. Although continental European powers controlled various coastal regions of southern and eastern India during the ensuing century, they eventually lost all their territories in India to the British, with the exception of the French outposts of Pondichéry and Chandernagore,[357] and the Portuguese colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu.[358]\n\n\n\n### East India Company rule in India[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: East India Company and Company rule in India\n\nIndia under East India Company rule\n![](image)\nIndia in 1765 and 1805 showing East India Company Territories in pink.\n![](image)\nIndia in 1837 and 1857 showing East India Company (pink) and other territories\n\nThe English East India Company was founded in 1600. It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a factory in Masulipatnam on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and a grant of rights by the Mughal emperor Jahangir to establish a factory in Surat in 1612. In 1640, after receiving similar permission from the Vijayanagara ruler farther south, a second factory was established in Madras on the southeastern coast. The islet of *Bom Bahia* in present-day Mumbai (Bombay), was a Portuguese outpost not far from Surat, it was presented to Charles II of England as dowry, in his marriage to Catherine of Braganza; Charles in turn leased Bombay to the Company in 1668. Two decades later, the company established a trade post in the River Ganges delta. During this time other companies established by the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and Danish were similarly expanding in the subcontinent.\n\n\nThe company's victory under Robert Clive in the 1757 Battle of Plassey and another victory in the 1764 Battle of Buxar (in Bihar), consolidated the company's power, and forced emperor Shah Alam II to appoint it the *diwan*, or revenue collector, of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The company thus became the *de facto* ruler of large areas of the lower Gangetic plain by 1773. It also proceeded by degrees to expand its dominions around Bombay and Madras. The Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766–99) and the Anglo-Maratha Wars (1772–1818) left it in control of large areas of India south of the Sutlej River. With the defeat of the Marathas, no native power represented a threat for the company any longer.[359]\n\n\nThe expansion of the company's power chiefly took two forms. The first of these was the outright annexation of Indian states and subsequent direct governance of the underlying regions that collectively came to comprise British India. The annexed regions included the North-Western Provinces (comprising Rohilkhand, Gorakhpur, and the Doab) (1801), Delhi (1803), Assam (Ahom Kingdom 1828) and Sindh (1843). Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir were annexed after the Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1849–56 (Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General). However, Kashmir was immediately sold under the Treaty of Amritsar (1850) to the Dogra Dynasty of Jammu and thereby became a princely state. In 1854, Berar was annexed along with the state of Oudh two years later.[360]\n\n\n\n* ![Warren Hastings, the first governor-general of Fort William (Bengal) who oversaw the company's territories in India.](image)\n\nWarren Hastings, the first governor-general of Fort William (Bengal) who oversaw the company's territories in India.\n* ![Gold coin, minted 1835, with obverse showing the bust of William IV, king of United Kingdom from 26 June 1830 to 20 June 1837, and reverse marked \"Two mohurs\" in English (do ashrafi in Urdu) issued during Company rule in India](image)\n\nGold coin, minted 1835, with obverse showing the bust of William IV, king of United Kingdom from 26 June 1830 to 20 June 1837, and reverse marked \"Two mohurs\" in English (do ashrafi in Urdu) issued during Company rule in India\n* ![Photograph (1855) showing the construction of the Bhor Ghaut incline bridge, Bombay; the incline was conceived by George Clark, the Chief Engineer in the East India Company's Government of Bombay.](image)\n\nPhotograph (1855) showing the construction of the Bhor Ghaut incline bridge, Bombay; the incline was conceived by George Clark, the Chief Engineer in the East India Company's Government of Bombay.\n* ![Watercolor (1863) titled, The Ganges Canal, Roorkee, Saharanpur District (U.P.).

Since the company operated under financial constraints, it had to set up *political* underpinnings for its rule.[361] The most important such support came from the *subsidiary alliances* with Indian princes.[361] In the early 19th century, the territories of these princes accounted for two-thirds of India.[361] When an Indian ruler who was able to secure his territory wanted to enter such an alliance, the company welcomed it as an economical method of indirect rule that did not involve the economic costs of direct administration or the political costs of gaining the support of alien subjects.[362]\n\n\nIn return, the company undertook the \"defense of these subordinate allies and treated them with traditional respect and marks of honor.\"[362] Subsidiary alliances created the Princely States of the Hindu maharajas and the Muslim nawabs. Prominent among the princely states were Cochin (1791), Jaipur (1794), Travancore (1795), Hyderabad (1798), Mysore (1799), Cis-Sutlej Hill States (1815), Central India Agency (1819), Cutch and Gujarat Gaikwad territories (1819), Rajputana (1818) and Bahawalpur (1833).[360]\n\n\n\n#### Indian indenture system[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian indenture system\n\nThe Indian indenture system was an ongoing system of indenture, a form of debt bondage, by which 3.5 million Indians were transported to colonies of European powers to provide labor for the (mainly sugar) plantations. It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of a large Indian diaspora that spread from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean and the growth of large Indo-Caribbean and Indo-African populations.\n\n\n\n## Late modern and contemporary period (after c. 1850 CE)[edit]\n\n\n### Rebellion of 1857 and its consequences[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian Rebellion of 1857\n\n* ![Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during the rebellion.](image)\n\nCharles Canning, the Governor-General of India during the rebellion.\n* ![Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the Doctrine of Lapse.](image)\n\nLord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the Doctrine of Lapse.\n* ![Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi, one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the Doctrine of lapse.](image)\n\nLakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi, one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the Doctrine of lapse.\n* ![Bahadur Shah Zafar the last Mughal Emperor, crowned Emperor of India by the rebels, he was deposed by the British, and died in exile in Burma](image)\n\nBahadur Shah Zafar the last Mughal Emperor, crowned Emperor of India by the rebels, he was deposed by the British, and died in exile in Burma\n\nThe Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the British East India Company in northern and central India against the company's rule. The spark that led to the mutiny was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle, which was insensitive to local religious prohibition. The key mutineer was Mangal Pandey.[363] In addition, the underlying grievances over British taxation, the ethnic gulf between the British officers and their Indian troops and land annexations played a significant role in the rebellion. Within weeks after Pandey's mutiny, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. The rebel soldiers were later joined by Indian nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the Doctrine of Lapse and felt that the company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as Nana Sahib and the Rani of Jhansi belonged to this group.[364]\n\n\nAfter the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels very quickly reached Delhi. The rebels had also captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). Most notably, in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British presence.[365] However, the British East India Company mobilised rapidly with the assistance of friendly Princely states, but it took the British the better part of 1858 to suppress the rebellion. Due to the rebels being poorly equipped and having no outside support or funding, they were brutally subdued.[366]\n\n\nIn the aftermath, all power was transferred from the British East India Company to the British Crown, which began to administer most of India as provinces. The Crown controlled the company's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir). They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947–48.[367]\n\n\n\n### British Raj (1858–1947)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British Raj\n\nBritish Raj\n![](image)\nThe British Indian Empire in 1909.

The Indian Penal Code came into being.[368] In education, Thomas Babington Macaulay had made schooling a priority for the Raj in 1835 and succeeded in implementing the use of English for instruction. By 1890 some 60,000 Indians had matriculated.[369] The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, and the population also grew at 1%. However, from 1910s Indian private industry began to grow significantly. India built a modern railway system in the late 19th century which was the fourth largest in the world.[370] Historians have been bitterly divided on issues of economic history, with the Nationalist school arguing that India was poorer due to British rule.[371]\n\n\nIn 1905, Lord Curzon split the large province of Bengal into a largely Hindu western half and \"Eastern Bengal and Assam\", a largely Muslim eastern half. The British goal was said to be efficient administration but the people of Bengal were outraged at the apparent \"divide and rule\" strategy. It also marked the beginning of the organised anti-colonial movement. When the Liberal party in Britain came to power in 1906, he was removed. Bengal was reunified in 1911. The new Viceroy Gilbert Minto and the new Secretary of State for India John Morley consulted with Congress leaders on political reforms. The Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 provided for Indian membership of the provincial executive councils as well as the Viceroy's executive council. The Imperial Legislative Council was enlarged from 25 to 60 members and separate communal representation for Muslims was established in a dramatic step towards representative and responsible government.[372] Several socio-religious organisations came into being at that time. Muslims set up the All India Muslim League in 1906 to protect the interests of the aristocratic Muslims. The Hindu Mahasabha and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) sought to represent Hindu interests though the latter always claimed it to be a \"cultural\" organisation.[373] Sikhs founded the Shiromani Akali Dal in 1920.[374] However, the largest and oldest political party Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, attempted to keep a distance from the socio-religious movements and identity politics.[375]\n\n\n\n* ![Two silver rupee coins issued by the British Raj in 1862 and 1886 respectively, the first in obverse showing a bust of Victoria, Queen, the second of Victoria, Empress.

Historian Nitish Sengupta describes the renaissance as having started with reformer and humanitarian Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1775–1833), and ended with Asia's first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941).[376] This flowering of religious and social reformers, scholars, and writers is described by historian David Kopf as \"one of the most creative periods in Indian history.\"[377]\n\n\nDuring this period, Bengal witnessed an intellectual awakening that is in some way similar to the Renaissance. This movement questioned existing orthodoxies, particularly with respect to women, marriage, the dowry system, the caste system, and religion. One of the earliest social movements that emerged during this time was the Young Bengal movement, which espoused rationalism and atheism as the common denominators of civil conduct among upper caste educated Hindus.[378] It played an important role in reawakening Indian minds and intellect across the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\n\n#### Famines[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Famine in India and Timeline of major famines in India during British rule\n\nSee also: Demographics of India\n\n* ![Map of famines in India 1800–1885](image)\n\nMap of famines in India 1800–1885\n* ![Engraving from The Graphic, October 1877, showing the plight of animals as well as humans in Bellary district, Madras Presidency, British India during the Great Famine of 1876–1878.](image)\n\nEngraving from *The Graphic*, October 1877, showing the plight of animals as well as humans in Bellary district, Madras Presidency, British India during the Great Famine of 1876–1878.\n* ![Government famine relief, Ahmedabad, India, during the Indian famine of 1899–1900.](image)\n\nGovernment famine relief, Ahmedabad, India, during the Indian famine of 1899–1900.\n* ![A picture of orphans who survived the Bengal famine of 1943](image)\n\nA picture of orphans who survived the Bengal famine of 1943\n\nDuring British East India Company and British Crown rule, India experienced some of deadliest ever recorded famines. These famines, usually resulting from crop failures and often exacerbated by policies of the colonial government,[379] included the Great Famine of 1876–1878 in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died,[380] the Great Bengal famine of 1770 where between 1 and 10 million people died,[381][382] the Indian famine of 1899–1900 in which 1.25 to 10 million people died,[379] and the Bengal famine of 1943 where between 2.1 and 3.8 million people died.[383] The Third plague pandemic in the mid-19th century killed 10 million people in India.[384] Despite persistent diseases and famines, the population of the Indian subcontinent, which stood at up to 200 million in 1750,[385] had reached 389 million by 1941.[386]\n\n\n\n#### World War I[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian Army during World War I\n\n* ![Indian Cavalry on the Western front 1914.](image)\n\nIndian Cavalry on the Western front 1914.\n* ![Indian cavalry from the Deccan Horse during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge in 1916.](image)\n\nIndian cavalry from the Deccan Horse during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge in 1916.\n* ![Indian Army gunners (probably 39th Battery) with 3.7-inch mountain howitzers, Jerusalem 1917.](image)\n\nIndian Army gunners (probably 39th Battery) with 3.7-inch mountain howitzers, Jerusalem 1917.\n* ![India Gate is a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in the period 1914–21 in the First World War.](image)\n\nIndia Gate is a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in the period 1914–21 in the First World War.\n\nDuring World War I, over 800,000 volunteered for the army, and more than 400,000 volunteered for non-combat roles, compared with the pre-war annual recruitment of about 15,000 men.[387] The Army saw early action on the Western Front at the First Battle of Ypres. After a year of front-line duty, sickness and casualties had reduced the Indian Corps to the point where it had to be withdrawn. Nearly 700,000 Indians fought the Turks in the Mesopotamian campaign. Indian formations were also sent to East Africa, Egypt, and Gallipoli.[388]\n\n\nIndian Army and Imperial Service Troops fought during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign's defence of the Suez Canal in 1915, at Romani in 1916 and to Jerusalem in 1917. India units occupied the Jordan Valley and after the German spring offensive they became the major force in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during the Battle of Megiddo and in the Desert Mounted Corps' advance to Damascus and on to Aleppo. Other divisions remained in India guarding the North-West Frontier and fulfilling internal security obligations.\n\n\nOne million Indian troops served abroad during the war. In total, 74,187 died,[389] and another 67,000 were wounded.[390] The roughly 90,000 soldiers who died fighting in World War I and the Afghan Wars are commemorated by the India Gate.\n\n\n\n#### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: India in World War II\n\n* ![General Claude Auchinleck (right), Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, with the then Viceroy Wavell (centre) and General Montgomery (left)](image)\n\nGeneral Claude Auchinleck (right), Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, with the then Viceroy Wavell (centre) and General Montgomery (left)\n* ![Indian women training for Air Raid Precautions (ARP) duties in Bombay, 1942](image)\n\nIndian women training for Air Raid Precautions (ARP) duties in Bombay, 1942\n* ![Indian infantrymen of the 7th Rajput Regiment about to go on patrol on the Arakan front in Burma, 1944.](image)\n\nIndian infantrymen of the 7th Rajput Regiment about to go on patrol on the Arakan front in Burma, 1944.\n* ![The stamp series \"Victory\" issued by the Government of British India to commemorate allied victory in World War II.](image)\n\nThe stamp series \"Victory\" issued by the Government of British India to commemorate allied victory in World War II.\n\nBritish India officially declared war on Nazi Germany in September 1939.[391] The British Raj, as part of the Allied Nations, sent over two and a half million volunteer soldiers to fight under British command against the Axis powers. Additionally, several Princely States provided large donations to support the Allied campaign. India also provided the base for American operations in support of China in the China Burma India Theatre.\n\n\nIndians fought with distinction throughout the world, including in the European theatre against Germany, in North Africa against Germany and Italy, against the Italians in East Africa, in the Middle East against the Vichy French, in the South Asian region defending India against the Japanese and fighting the Japanese in Burma. Indians also aided in liberating British colonies such as Singapore and Hong Kong after the Japanese surrender in August 1945. Over 87,000 soldiers from the subcontinent died in World War II.\n\n\nThe Indian National Congress denounced Nazi Germany but would not fight it or anyone else until India was independent. Congress launched the Quit India Movement in August 1942, refusing to co-operate in any way with the government until independence was granted. The government immediately arrested over 60,000 national and local Congress leaders. The Muslim League rejected the Quit India movement and worked closely with the Raj authorities.\n\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose (also called *Netaji*) broke with Congress and tried to form a military alliance with Germany or Japan to gain independence. The Germans assisted Bose in the formation of the Indian Legion;[392] however, it was Japan that helped him revamp the Indian National Army (INA), after the First Indian National Army under Mohan Singh was dissolved. The INA fought under Japanese direction, mostly in Burma.[393] Bose also headed the Provisional Government of Free India (or Azad Hind), a government-in-exile based in Singapore.[394][395]\n\n\nBy 1942, neighbouring Burma was invaded by Japan, which by then had already captured the Indian territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Japan gave nominal control of the islands to the Provisional Government of Free India on 21 October 1943, and in the following March, the Indian National Army with the help of Japan crossed into India and advanced as far as Kohima in Nagaland. This advance on the mainland of the Indian subcontinent reached its farthest point on Indian territory, retreating from the Battle of Kohima in June and from that of Imphal on 3 July 1944.\n\n\nThe region of Bengal in British India suffered a devastating famine during 1940–1943. An estimated 2.1–3 million died from the famine, frequently characterised as \"man-made\",[396] with most sources asserting that wartime colonial policies exacerbated the crisis.[397]\n\n\n\n### Indian independence movement (1885–1947)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian independence movement\n\nSee also: Indian independence activists and Pakistan Movement\n\n* ![The first session of the Indian National Congress in 1885.

However, historians are divided over the causes of its rise. Probable reasons include a \"clash of interests of the Indian people with British interests\",[402] \"racial discriminations\",[403] and \"the revelation of India's past\".[404]\n\n\nThe first step toward Indian self-rule was the appointment of councillors to advise the British viceroy in 1861 and the first Indian was appointed in 1909. Provincial Councils with Indian members were also set up. The councillors' participation was subsequently widened into legislative councils. The British built a large British Indian Army, with the senior officers all British and many of the troops from small minority groups such as Gurkhas from Nepal and Sikhs.[405] The civil service was increasingly filled with natives at the lower levels, with the British holding the more senior positions.[406]\n\n\nBal Gangadhar Tilak, an Indian nationalist leader, declared Swaraj (home rule) as the destiny of the nation. His popular sentence \"Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it\"[407] became the source of inspiration. Tilak was backed by rising public leaders like Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai, who held the same point of view, notably they advocated the Swadeshi movement involving the boycott of imported items and the use of Indian-made goods;[408] the triumvirate were popularly known as Lal Bal Pal. In 1907, the Congress was split into two factions: The radicals, led by Tilak, advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the British Empire and the abandonment of all things British. The moderates, led by leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, on the other hand, wanted reform within the framework of British rule.[408]\n\n\nThe partition of Bengal in 1905 further increased the revolutionary movement for Indian independence. The disenfranchisement lead some to take violent action.\n\n\nThe British themselves adopted a \"carrot and stick\" approach in response to renewed nationalist demands. The means of achieving the proposed measure were later enshrined in the Government of India Act 1919, which introduced the principle of a dual mode of administration, or diarchy, in which elected Indian legislators and appointed British officials shared power.[409] In 1919, Colonel Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to fire their weapons on peaceful protestors, including unarmed women and children, resulting in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre; which led to the Non-cooperation Movement of 1920–1922. The massacre was a decisive episode towards the end of British rule in India.[410]\n\n\nFrom 1920 leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi began highly popular mass movements to campaign against the British Raj using largely peaceful methods. The Gandhi-led independence movement opposed the British rule using non-violent methods like non-co-operation, civil disobedience and economic resistance. However, revolutionary activities against the British rule took place throughout the Indian subcontinent and some others adopted a militant approach like the Hindustan Republican Association, that sought to overthrow British rule by armed struggle.\n\n\nThe All India Azad Muslim Conference gathered in Delhi in April 1940 to voice its support for an independent and united India.[411] Its members included several Islamic organisations in India, as well as 1400 nationalist Muslim delegates.[412][413][414] The pro-separatist All-India Muslim League worked to try to silence those nationalist Muslims who stood against the partition of India, often using \"intimidation and coercion\".[413][414] The murder of the All India Azad Muslim Conference leader Allah Bakhsh Soomro also made it easier for the pro-separatist All-India Muslim League to demand the creation of a Pakistan.[414]\n\n\n\n#### After World War II (c. 1946–1947)[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new; when an age ends; and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n — From, Tryst with destiny, a speech given by Jawaharlal Nehru to the Constituent Assembly of India on the eve of independence, 14 August 1947.[415]\n\nIn January 1946, several mutinies broke out in the armed services, starting with that of RAF servicemen frustrated with their slow repatriation. The mutinies came to a head with mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy in Bombay in February 1946, followed by others in Calcutta, Madras, and Karachi. The mutinies were rapidly suppressed. In early 1946, new elections were called and Congress candidates won in eight of the eleven provinces.\n\n\nLate in 1946, the Labour government decided to end British rule of India, and in early 1947 it announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948 and participating in the formation of an interim government.\n\n\nAlong with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years. Muslim League leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah proclaimed 16 August 1946 as Direct Action Day, with the stated goal of highlighting, peacefully, the demand for a Muslim homeland in British India, which resulted in the outbreak of the cycle of violence that would be later called the \"Great Calcutta Killing of August 1946\". The communal violence spread to Bihar, Noakhali in Bengal, Garhmukteshwar in the United Provinces, and on to Rawalpindi in March 1947 in which Sikhs and Hindus were attacked or driven out by Muslims.\n\n\n\n![](image)Literacy in India grew very slowly until independence in 1947.

In particular, the partition of Punjab and Bengal led to rioting between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in these provinces and spread to other nearby regions, leaving some 500,000 dead. The police and army units were largely ineffective. The British officers were gone, and the units were beginning to tolerate if not actually indulge in violence against their religious enemies.[416][417][418] Also, this period saw one of the largest mass migrations anywhere in modern history, with a total of 12 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly created nations of India and Pakistan (which gained independence on 15 and 14 August 1947 respectively).[417] In 1971, Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan and East Bengal, seceded from Pakistan.[419]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Adivasi\n* *Early Indians*\n* List of Indian periods\n* Economic history of India\n\n\n* Historiography of India\n* History of India (1947–present)\n* Foreign relations of India\n* Indian maritime history\n* Linguistic history of India\n* Military history of India\n* Outline of ancient India\n* Taxation in medieval India\n* *The Cambridge History of India*\n* Timeline of Indian history\n* Traditional games of India\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The \"First urbanisation\" was the Indus Valley Civilisation.[70]\n2. **^** Many historians consider Attock to be the final frontier of the Maratha Empire[338]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Michael D.

However, the book is a tribute to the role of one Muslim leader who steadfastly opposed the Partition of India: the Sindhi leader Allah Bakhsh Soomro. Allah Bakhsh belonged to a landed family. He founded the Sindh People's Party in 1934, which later came to be known as 'Ittehad' or 'Unity Party'. ... Allah Bakhsh was totally opposed to the Muslim League's demand for the creation of Pakistan through a division of India on a religious basis. Consequently, he established the Azad Muslim Conference. In its Delhi session held during April 27–30, 1940 some 1400 delegates took part. They belonged mainly to the lower castes and working class. The famous scholar of Indian Islam, Wilfred Cantwell Smith, feels that the delegates represented a 'majority of India's Muslims'. Among those who attended the conference were representatives of many Islamic theologians and women also took part in the deliberations ... Shamsul Islam argues that the All-India Muslim League at times used intimidation and coercion to silence any opposition among Muslims to its demand for Partition. He calls such tactics of the Muslim League as a 'Reign of Terror'. He gives examples from all over India including the NWFP where the Khudai Khidmatgars remain opposed to the Partition of India.\n414. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Ali, Afsar (17 July 2017). \"Partition of India and Patriotism of Indian Muslims\". *The Milli Gazette*.\n415. **^** \"Great speeches of the 20th century\". *The Guardian*. 8 February 2008.\n416. **^** Philip Ziegler, *Mountbatten*(1985) p. 401.\n417. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Symonds, Richard (1950). *The Making of Pakistan*.

subcontinent between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago.[1] The earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago. Sedentariness began in South Asia around 7000 BCE;[2] by 4500 BCE, settled life had spread,[2] and gradually evolved into the Indus Valley civilisation, which flourished between 2500 BCE and 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan and north-western India. Early in the second millennium BCE, persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter from large urban centres to villages. Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration. The Vedic Period (1500–500 BCE) was marked by the composition of their large collections of hymns (Vedas). The social structure was stratified via the varna system, which persists till this day. The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain. Around 600 BCE, a new, interregional culture arose; then, small chieftaincies (janapadas) were consolidated into larger states (mahajanapadas). A second urbanisation took place, which came with the rise of new ascetic movements and religious concepts,[3] including the rise of Jainism and Buddhism. The latter was synthesised with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, giving rise to Hinduism.\n\n\n\n![](image)Indian cultural influence (Greater India)\n![](image)Timeline of Indian history\nChandragupta Maurya overthrew the Nanda Empire and established the first great empire in ancient India, the Maurya Empire. The Maurya Empire would collapse in 185 BCE, on the assassination of the then-emperor Brihadratha by his general Pushyamitra Shunga. Shunga would go on to form the Shunga Empire in the north and northeast of the subcontinent, while the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom would claim the northwest and found the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties, including the Gupta Empire, in the 4th to 6th centuries CE. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the Classical or Golden Age of India. Aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion spread to much of Asia, which led to the establishment of Indianised kingdoms in the region, forming Greater India.[4][5] The most significant event between the 7th and 11th century was the Tripartite struggle centred on Kannauj. Southern India saw the rise of multiple imperial powers from the middle of the fifth century. The Chola dynasty conquered southern India in the 11th century.[6][7] In the early medieval period Indian mathematics, including Hindu numerals, influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Arab world, including the creation of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.[8]\n\n\nIslamic conquests made limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Sindh as early as the 8th century,[9] followed by the invasions of Mahmud Ghazni.[10]\nThe Delhi Sultanate was founded in 1206 CE by Central Asian Turks who ruled a major part of the northern Indian subcontinent in the early 14th century, but declined in the late 14th century,[11] and saw the advent of the Deccan sultanates.[12] The wealthy Bengal Sultanate also emerged as a major power, lasting over three centuries.[13] This period also saw the emergence of several powerful Hindu states, notably the Vijayanagara Empire and Rajput states. The 15th century saw the advent of Sikhism. \n\n\nThe early modern period began in the 16th century, when the Mughal Empire conquered most of the Indian subcontinent,[14] signaling the proto-industrialization, becoming the biggest global economy and manufacturing power.[15][16][17] The Mughals suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, which provided opportunities for the Marathas, Sikhs, Mysoreans, Nizams, and Nawabs of Bengal to control large regions of the Indian subcontinent.[18][19] From the mid-18th to the mid-19th century, large regions of India were gradually annexed by the East India Company, acting as a sovereign power on behalf of the British government. Dissatisfaction with company rule in India led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. India was afterwards ruled directly by the British Crown, in the British Raj. After World War I, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian National Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi. Later, the All-India Muslim League would advocate for a separate Muslim-majority nation state. The British Indian Empire was partitioned in August 1947 into the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan, each gaining its independence.\n\n\n\n\n##  Prehistoric era (until c. 3300 BCE)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains too many or overly lengthy quotations**.

Although the rock art has not been directly dated,[20] it has been argued on circumstantial grounds that many paintings were completed by 8000 BCE,[21][22] and some slightly earlier.[23]\n![](image)\nA dolmen erected by Neolithic people in Marayur, Kerala, India.\n![](image)\nStone Age (6,000 BCE) carvings of Edakkal Caves in Kerala, India.\n\n### Paleolithic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: South Asian Stone Age\nHominin expansion from Africa is estimated to have reached the Indian subcontinent approximately two million years ago, and possibly as early as 2.2 million years ago.[24][25][26] This dating is based on the known presence of *Homo erectus* in Indonesia by 1.8 million years ago and in East Asia by 1.36 million years ago, as well as the discovery of stone tools at Riwat in Pakistan.[25][27] Although some older discoveries have been claimed, the suggested dates, based on the dating of fluvial sediments, have not been independently verified.[26][28]\n\n\nThe oldest hominin fossil remains in the Indian subcontinent are those of *Homo erectus* or *Homo heidelbergensis*, from the Narmada Valley in central India, and are dated to approximately half a million years ago.[25][28] Older fossil finds have been claimed, but are considered unreliable.[28] Reviews of archaeological evidence have suggested that occupation of the Indian subcontinent by hominins was sporadic until approximately 700,000 years ago, and was geographically widespread by approximately 250,000 years ago.[28][26]\n\n\n\nAccording to a historical demographer of South Asia, Tim Dyson: \n\n\n> Modern human beings—Homo sapiens—originated in Africa. Then, intermittently, sometime between 60,000 and 80,000 years ago, tiny groups of them began to enter the north-west of the Indian subcontinent. It seems likely that initially, they came by way of the coast. ... it is virtually certain that there were Homo sapiens in the subcontinent 55,000 years ago, even though the earliest fossils that have been found of them date to only about 30,000 years before the present.[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to Michael D. Petraglia and Bridget Allchin: \n\n\n> Y-Chromosome and Mt-DNA data support the colonization of South Asia by modern humans originating in Africa. ... Coalescence dates for most non-European populations average to between 73–55 ka.[30]\n> \n> \n\n\nHistorian of South Asia, Michael H. Fisher, states: \n\n\n> Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the Homo sapiens range beyond Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago to as late as 40,000 years ago, although there may have been prior unsuccessful emigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each generation, spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago.[31]\n> \n> \n\n\nArchaeological evidence has been interpreted to suggest the presence of anatomically modern humans in the Indian subcontinent 78,000–74,000 years ago,[32] although this interpretation is disputed.[33][34] The occupation of South Asia by modern humans, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has turned it into a highly diverse one, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[35]\n\n\n\nAccording to Tim Dyson: \n\n\n> Genetic research has contributed to knowledge of the prehistory of the subcontinent's people in other respects. In particular, the level of genetic diversity in the region is extremely high. Indeed, only Africa's population is genetically more diverse. Related to this, there is strong evidence of 'founder' events in the subcontinent. By this is meant circumstances where a subgroup—such as a tribe—derives from a tiny number of 'original' individuals. Further, compared to most world regions, the subcontinent's people are relatively distinct in having practised comparatively high levels of endogamy.[35]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Neolithic[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mehrgarh site, in Beluchistan, Pakistan\nSettled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus River alluvium approximately 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[2][36] According to Tim Dyson: \"By 7,000 years ago agriculture was firmly established in Baluchistan... [and] slowly spread eastwards into the Indus valley.\" Michael Fisher adds:[37] \n\n\n> The earliest discovered instance ... of well-established, settled agricultural society is at Mehrgarh in the hills between the Bolan Pass and the Indus plain (today in Pakistan) (see Map 3.1). From as early as 7000 BCE, communities there started investing increased labor in preparing the land and selecting, planting, tending, and harvesting particular grain-producing plants. They also domesticated animals, including sheep, goats, pigs, and oxen (both humped zebu [*Bos indicus*] and unhumped [*Bos taurus*]). Castrating oxen, for instance, turned them from mainly meat sources into domesticated draft-animals as well.[37]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Bronze Age (c. 3300 – c. 1800 BCE)[edit]\n\n\n### Indus Valley Civilisation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indus Valley Civilisation\n\nSee also: List of Indus Valley Civilisation sites\n\n![](image)Mature Harappan Period, c. 2600 - 1900 BCE\nThe Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent began around 3300 BCE.[*citation needed*] The Indus Valley region was one of three early cradles of civilization in the Old World; the Indus Valley civilisation was the most expansive,[38] and at its peak, may have had a population of over five million.[39]\n\n\nThe civilisation was primarily centered in modern-day Pakistan, in the Indus river basin, and secondarily in the Ghaggar-Hakra River basin. The mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilisation on the Indian subcontinent. It included cities such as Harappa, Ganweriwal, and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan, and Dholavira, Kalibangan, Rakhigarhi, and Lothal in modern-day India.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mohenjo-daro, one of the largest Indus cities.

Civilization also developed a Indus script, which is presently undeciphered.[41] This is the reason why Harappan language is not directly attested, and its affiliation uncertain.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Three stamp seals and their impressions bearing Indus script characters alongside animals: \"unicorn\" (left), bull (center), and elephant (right); Guimet Museum\nAfter the collapse of Indus Valley civilisation, the inhabitants migrated from the river valleys of Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra, towards the Himalayan foothills of Ganga-Yamuna basin.[43]\n\n\n\n### Ochre Coloured Pottery culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinauli \"*chariot\"*, photograph of the Archaeological Survey of India.[44]\nDuring 2nd millennium BCE, Ochre Coloured Pottery culture was in Ganga Yamuna Doab region. These were rural settlement with agriculture and hunting. They were using copper tools such as axes, spears, arrows, and swords, and had domesticated animals.[45]\n\n\n\n## Iron Age (c. 1800 – 200 BCE)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Iron Age in India\n\n### Vedic period (c. 1500 – 600 BCE)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Vedic period, Historical Vedic religion, and Vedas\n\nSee also: Indo-Aryan peoples and Indo-Aryan migrations\n\nStarting ca. 1900 BCE, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration.[46][47] The Vedic period is the period when the Vedas were composed, the liturgical hymns from the Indo-Aryan people. The Vedic culture was located in part of north-west India, while other parts of India had a distinct cultural identity. Many regions of the Indian subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age in this period.[48]\n\n\nThe Vedic culture is described in the texts of Vedas, still sacred to Hindus, which were orally composed and transmitted in Vedic Sanskrit. The Vedas are some of the oldest extant texts in India.[49] The Vedic period, lasting from about 1500 to 500 BCE,[50][51] contributed the foundations of several cultural aspects of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\n\n#### Vedic society[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An early 19th century manuscript in the Devanagari script of the Rigveda, originally transmitted orally with fidelity[52]\nHistorians have analysed the Vedas to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[48] The peepal tree and cow were sanctified by the time of the Atharva Veda.[53] Many of the concepts of Indian philosophy espoused later, like dharma, trace their roots to Vedic antecedents.[54]\n\n\nEarly Vedic society is described in the Rigveda, the oldest Vedic text, believed to have been compiled during 2nd millennium BCE,[55][56] in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent.[57] At this time, Aryan society consisted of largely tribal and pastoral groups, distinct from the Harappan urbanisation which had been abandoned.[58] The early Indo-Aryan presence probably corresponds, in part, to the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture in archaeological contexts.[59][60]\n\n\nAt the end of the Rigvedic period, the Aryan society began to expand from the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent, into the western Ganges plain. It became increasingly agricultural and was socially organised around the hierarchy of the four *varnas*, or social classes. This social structure was characterized both by syncretising with the native cultures of northern India,[61] but also eventually by the excluding of some indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure.[62] During this period, many of the previous small tribal units and chiefdoms began to coalesce into Janapadas (monarchical, state-level polities).[63]\n\n\n\n#### Janapadas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Janapada\n\nSee also: Battle of the Ten Kings and List of ancient Indo-Aryan peoples and tribes\n\n![](image)Late Vedic era map showing the boundaries of Āryāvarta with Janapadas in northern India, beginning of Iron Age kingdoms in India – Kuru, Panchala, Kosala, Videha\nThe Iron Age in the Indian subcontinent from about 1200 BCE to the 6th century BCE is defined by the rise of Janapadas, which are realms, republics and kingdoms—notably the Iron Age Kingdoms of Kuru, Panchala, Kosala, Videha.[64][65]\n\n\nThe Kuru Kingdom (c. 1200–450 BCE) was the first state-level society of the Vedic period, corresponding to the beginning of the Iron Age in northwestern India, around 1200–800 BCE,[66] as well as with the composition of the Atharvaveda.[67] The Kuru state organised the Vedic hymns into collections, and developed the srauta ritual to uphold the social order.[67] Two key figures of the Kuru state were king Parikshit and his successor Janamejaya, transforming this realm into the dominant political, social, and cultural power of northern India.[67] When the Kuru kingdom declined, the centre of Vedic culture shifted to their eastern neighbours, the Panchala kingdom.[67] The archaeological PGW (Painted Grey Ware) culture, which flourished in the Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh regions of northern India from about 1100 to 600 BCE,[59] is believed to correspond to the Kuru and Panchala kingdoms.[67][68]\n\n\nDuring the Late Vedic Period, the kingdom of Videha emerged as a new centre of Vedic culture, situated even farther to the East (in what is today Nepal and Bihar state);[60] reaching its prominence under the king Janaka, whose court provided patronage for Brahmin sages and philosophers such as Yajnavalkya, Aruni, and Gārgī Vāchaknavī.[69] The later part of this period corresponds with a consolidation of increasingly large states and kingdoms, called *Mahajanapadas*, across Northern India.\n\n\n\n### Second urbanisation (c. 600 – 200 BCE)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City of Kushinagar in the 5th century BCE according to a 1st-century BCE frieze in Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern Gate.\nThe period between 800 and 200 BCE saw the formation of the *Śramaṇa* movement, from which Jainism and Buddhism originated. The first Upanishads were written during this period. After 500 BCE, the so-called \"second urbanisation\"[note 1] started, with new urban settlements arising at the Ganges plain.[70] The foundations for the \"second urbanisation\" were laid prior to 600 BCE, in the Painted Grey Ware culture of the Ghaggar-Hakra and Upper Ganges Plain; although most PGW sites were small farming villages, \"several dozen\" PGW sites eventually emerged as relatively large settlements that can be characterized as towns, the largest of which were fortified by ditches or moats and embankments made of piled earth with wooden palisades.[71]\n\n\nThe Central Ganges Plain, where Magadha gained prominence, forming the base of the Maurya Empire, was a distinct cultural area,[72] with new states arising after 500 BCE.[73][74] It was influenced by the Vedic culture,[75] but differed markedly from the Kuru-Panchala region.[72] It \"was the area of the earliest known cultivation of rice in South Asia and by 1800 BCE was the location of an advanced Neolithic population associated with the sites of Chirand and Chechar\".[76] In this region, the Śramaṇic movements flourished, and Jainism and Buddhism originated.[70]\n\n\n\n#### Buddhism and Jainism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Upanishads and Śramaṇa\n\nFurther information: History of Hinduism, History of Buddhism, History of Jainism, Indian religions, and Indian philosophy\n\nUpanishads and Śramaṇa movements\n![](image)\nA page of *Isha Upanishad* manuscript.\n![](image)\nMahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara of Jainism.\n![](image)\nGautama Buddha's cremation stupa, Kushinagar (Kushinara).\n\nThe time between 800 BCE and 400 BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads,[77][78][79] which form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism, and are also known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Vedas).[80]\n\n\nThe increasing urbanisation of India in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or \"Śramaṇa movements\" which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals.[77] Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE), proponent of Jainism, and Gautama Buddha (c. 563–483 BCE), founder of Buddhism, were the most prominent icons of this movement. Śramaṇa gave rise to the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara, and the concept of liberation.[81] Buddha found a Middle Way that ameliorated the extreme asceticism found in the *Śramaṇa* religions.[82]\n\n\nAround the same time, Mahavira (the 24th *Tirthankara* in Jainism) propagated a theology that was to later become Jainism.[83] However, Jain orthodoxy believes the teachings of the *Tirthankaras* predates all known time and scholars believe Parshvanatha (c. 872 – c. 772 BCE), accorded status as the 23rd *Tirthankara*, was a historical figure. The Vedas are believed to have documented a few *Tirthankaras* and an ascetic order similar to the *Śramaṇa* movement.[84]\n\n\n\n#### Sanskrit epics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mahabharata and Ramayana\n\nSee also: List of historic Indian texts and List of Hindu texts\n\n![](image)Manuscript illustration of the Battle of Kurukshetra.\nThe Sanskrit epics *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata* were composed during this period.[85] The *Mahabharata* remains the longest single poem in the world.[86] Historians formerly postulated an \"epic age\" as the milieu of these two epic poems, but now recognize that the texts went through multiple stages of development over centuries.[87] The existing texts of these epics are believed to belong to the post-Vedic age, between c. 400 BCE and 400 CE.[87][88]\n\n\n\n#### Mahajanapadas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mahajanapadas\n\n![](image)The Mahajanapadas were the sixteen most powerful and vast kingdoms and republics of the era, located mainly across the Indo-Gangetic plains.\nThe period from c. 600 BCE to c. 300 BCE witnessed the rise of the Mahajanapadas, sixteen powerful and vast kingdoms and oligarchic republics. These Mahajanapadas evolved and flourished in a belt stretching from Gandhara in the northwest to Bengal in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent and included parts of the trans-Vindhyan region.[89] Ancient Buddhist texts, like the *Aṅguttara Nikāya*,[90] make frequent reference to these sixteen great kingdoms and republics—Anga, Assaka, Avanti, Chedi, Gandhara, Kashi, Kamboja, Kosala, Kuru, Magadha, Malla, Matsya (or Machcha), Panchala, Surasena, Vṛji, and Vatsa. This period saw the second major rise of urbanism in India after the Indus Valley Civilisation.[91]\n\n\nEarly \"republics\" or *gaṇasaṅgha*,[92] such as Shakyas, Koliyas, Mallakas, and Licchavis had republican governments. *Gaṇasaṅgha*s,[92] such as the Mallakas, centered in the city of Kusinagara, and the Vajjika League, centered in the city of Vaishali, existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE.[93] The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the Licchavis.[94]\n\n\nThis period corresponds in an archaeological context to the Northern Black Polished Ware culture. Especially focused in the Central Ganges plain but also spreading across vast areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent, this culture is characterized by the emergence of large cities with massive fortifications, significant population growth, increased social stratification, wide-ranging trade networks, construction of public architecture and water channels, specialized craft industries, a system of weights, punch-marked coins, and the introduction of writing in the form of Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts.[95][96] The language of the gentry at that time was Sanskrit, while the languages of the general population of northern India are referred to as Prakrits.\n\n\nMany of the sixteen kingdoms had coalesced into four major ones by 500/400 BCE, by the time of Gautama Buddha. These four were Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala, and Magadha.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Early Magadha dynasties[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Magadha and Greater Magadha\n\nSee also: Magadha period, Pradyota dynasty, Haryanka dynasty, and Shaishunaga dynasty\n\nMaghada dynasties\n![](image)\nThe Magadha state c. 600 BCE, before it expanded from its capital Rajagriha – under the Haryanka dynasty and the successor Shishunaga dynasty.\n![](image)\nIndian warrior of the Achaemenid army, circa 480 BCE, on the Tomb of Xerxes I.\n\nMagadha formed one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas (Sanskrit: \"Great Realms\") or kingdoms in ancient India. The core of the kingdom was the area of Bihar south of the Ganges; its first capital was Rajagriha (modern Rajgir) then Pataliputra (modern Patna). Magadha expanded to include most of Bihar and Bengal with the conquest of Licchavi and Anga respectively,[97] followed by much of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Orissa. The ancient kingdom of Magadha is heavily mentioned in Jain and Buddhist texts. It is also mentioned in the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas.[98] The earliest reference to the Magadha people occurs in the Atharva-Veda where they are found listed along with the Angas, Gandharis, and Mujavats. Magadha played an important role in the development of Jainism and Buddhism. The Magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions.\n\n\nEarly sources, from the Buddhist Pāli Canon, the Jain Agamas and the Hindu Puranas, mention Magadha being ruled by the Pradyota dynasty and Haryanka dynasty (c. 544–413 BCE) for some 200 years, c. 600–413 BCE. King Bimbisara of the Haryanka dynasty led an active and expansive policy, conquering Anga in what is now eastern Bihar and West Bengal. King Bimbisara was overthrown and killed by his son, Prince Ajatashatru, who continued the expansionist policy of Magadha. During this period, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, lived much of his life in the Magadha kingdom. He attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, gave his first sermon in Sarnath and the first Buddhist council was held in Rajgriha.[99] The Haryanka dynasty was overthrown by the Shaishunaga dynasty (c. 413–345 BCE). The last Shishunaga ruler, Kalasoka, was assassinated by Mahapadma Nanda in 345 BCE, the first of the so-called Nine Nandas (Mahapadma and his eight sons).\n\n\n\n#### Nanda Empire and Alexander's campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nanda Empire\n\nSee also: Indian campaign of Alexander the Great\n\nThe Nanda Empire (c. 345–322 BCE), at its greatest extent, extended from Bengal in the east, to the Punjab region in the west and as far south as the Vindhya Range.[100] The Nanda dynasty was famed for their great wealth. The Nanda dynasty built on the foundations laid by their Haryanka and Shishunaga predecessors to create the first great empire of north India.[101] To achieve this objective they built a vast army, consisting of 200,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalry, 2,000 war chariots and 3,000 war elephants (at the lowest estimates).[102][103][104][105]\n\n\n\n#### Maurya Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Maurya Empire\n\nMaurya Empire\n![](image)\nThe Maurya Empire under Ashoka the Great.\n![](image)\nAshokan pillar at Vaishali, 3rd century BCE.\n\nThe Maurya Empire (322–185 BCE) unified most of the Indian subcontinent into one state, and was the largest empire ever to exist on the Indian subcontinent.[106] At its greatest extent, the Mauryan Empire stretched to the north up to the natural boundaries of the Himalayas and to the east into what is now Assam. To the west, it reached beyond modern Pakistan, to the Hindu Kush mountains in what is now Afghanistan. The empire was established by Chandragupta Maurya assisted by Chanakya (Kautilya) in Magadha (in modern Bihar) when he overthrew the Nanda Empire.[107]\n\n\nChandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India, and by 317 BCE the empire had fully occupied Northwestern India. The Mauryan Empire defeated Seleucus I, founder of the Seleucid Empire, during the Seleucid–Mauryan war, thus gained additional territory west of the Indus River. Chandragupta's son Bindusara succeeded to the throne around 297 BCE. By the time he died in c. 272 BCE, a large part of the Indian subcontinent was under Mauryan suzerainty. However, the region of Kalinga (around modern day Odisha) remained outside Mauryan control, perhaps interfering with trade with the south.[108]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Mauryan carved door of Lomas Rishi, one of the Barabar Caves, c. 250 BCE.\nBindusara was succeeded by Ashoka, whose reign lasted until his death in about 232 BCE.[109] His campaign against the Kalingans in about 260 BCE, though successful, led to immense loss of life and misery. This led Ashoka to shun violence, and subsequently to embrace Buddhism.[108] The empire began to decline after his death and the last Mauryan ruler, Brihadratha, was assassinated by Pushyamitra Shunga to establish the Shunga Empire.[109]\n\n\nUnder Chandragupta Maurya and his successors, internal and external trade, agriculture, and economic activities all thrived and expanded across India thanks to the creation of a single efficient system of finance, administration, and security. The Mauryans built the Grand Trunk Road, one of Asia's oldest and longest major roads connecting the Indian subcontinent with Central Asia.[110] After the Kalinga War, the Empire experienced nearly half a century of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of scientific knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across India. Ashoka sponsored Buddhist missions into Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, West Asia, North Africa, and Mediterranean Europe.[111]\n\n\nThe *Arthashastra* written by Chanakya and the Edicts of Ashoka are the primary written records of the Mauryan times. Archaeologically, this period falls in the era of Northern Black Polished Ware. The Mauryan Empire was based on a modern and efficient economy and society. However, the sale of merchandise was closely regulated by the government.[112] Although there was no banking in the Mauryan society, usury was customary. A significant amount of written records on slavery are found, suggesting a prevalence thereof.[113] During this period, a high-quality steel called Wootz steel was developed in south India and was later exported to China and Arabia.[114]\n\n\n\n#### Sangam period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sangam period, Sources of ancient Tamil history, Sangam literature, and Five Great Epics\n\nSee also: Three Crowned Kings, Tamilakam, and List of Tamil monarchs\n\n![](image)\nTamilakam, located in the tip of South India during the Sangam period, ruled by Chera dynasty, Chola dynasty and the Pandyan dynasty.\n![](image)\nIlango Adigal is the author of *Silappatikaram*, one of the five great epics of Tamil literature.[115]\n\nDuring the Sangam period Tamil literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 4th century CE. Three Tamil dynasties, collectively known as the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam: Chera dynasty, Chola dynasty, and the Pandya dynasty ruled parts of southern India.[116]\n\n\nThe Sangam literature deals with the history, politics, wars, and culture of the Tamil people of this period.[117] Unlike Sanskrit writers who were mostly Brahmins, Sangam writers came from diverse classes and social backgrounds and were mostly non-Brahmins.[118]\n\n\nAround c. 300 BCE – c. 200 CE, Pathupattu, an anthology of ten mid-length book collections, which is considered part of Sangam Literature, were composed; the composition of eight anthologies of poetic works Ettuthogai as well as the composition of eighteen minor poetic works Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku; while Tolkāppiyam, the earliest grammarian work in the Tamil language was developed.[119] Also, during Sangam period, two of the Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature were composed. Ilango Adigal composed *Silappatikaram*, which is a non-religious work, that revolves around Kannagi,[120] and *Manimekalai*, composed by Chithalai Chathanar, is a sequel to *Silappatikaram*, and tells the story of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, who became a Buddhist Bikkuni.[121][122]\n\n\n\n## Classical period (c. 200 BCE – c. 650 CE)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Classical India\n\n* ![Ancient India during the rise of the Shungas from the North, Satavahanas from the Deccan, and Pandyas and Cholas from the southern tip of India.](image)\n\nAncient India during the rise of the Shungas from the North, Satavahanas from the Deccan, and Pandyas and Cholas from the southern tip of India.\n* ![The Great Chaitya in the Karla Caves.

Also, the Sangam literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE in southern India.[126] During this period, India's economy is estimated to have been the largest in the world, having between one-third and one-quarter of the world's wealth, from 1 CE to 1000 CE.[127][128]\n\n\n\n### Early classical period (c. 200 BCE – c. 320 CE)[edit]\n\n\n#### Shunga Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shunga Empire\n\nShunga Empire\n![](image)\nEast Gateway and Railings, Bharhut Stupa, 2nd century BCE.\n![](image)\nShunga art, 1st century BCE. Ancient vina\n![](image)\nRoyal family, 1st century B.C. West Bengal.\n\nThe Shungas originated from Magadha, and controlled large areas of the central and eastern Indian subcontinent from around 187 to 78 BCE. The dynasty was established by Pushyamitra Shunga, who overthrew the last Maurya emperor. Its capital was Pataliputra, but later emperors, such as Bhagabhadra, also held court at Vidisha, modern Besnagar.[129]\n\n\nPushyamitra Shunga ruled for 36 years and was succeeded by his son Agnimitra. There were ten Shunga rulers. However, after the death of Agnimitra, the empire rapidly disintegrated;[130] inscriptions and coins indicate that much of northern and central India consisted of small kingdoms and city-states that were independent of any Shunga hegemony.[131] The empire is noted for its numerous wars with both foreign and indigenous powers. They fought with the Mahameghavahana dynasty of Kalinga, Satavahana dynasty of Deccan, the Indo-Greeks, and possibly the Panchalas and Mitras of Mathura.\n\n\nArt, education, philosophy, and other forms of learning flowered during this period including architectural monuments such as the Stupa at Bharhut and the renowned Great Stupa at Sanchi. The Shunga rulers helped to establish the tradition of royal sponsorship of learning and art. The script used by the empire was a variant of Brahmi and was used to write the Sanskrit language. The Shunga Empire played an imperative role in patronising Indian culture at a time when some of the most important developments in Hindu thought were taking place.\n\n\n\n#### Satavahana Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Satavahana Empire\n\nSatavahana Empire\n![](image)\nSanchi Stupa Two and Southern Gateway, 1st century CE (UNESCO World Heritage Site).\n![](image)\nIndian ship on lead coin of Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi, testimony to the naval, seafaring and trading capabilities of the Sātavāhanas during the 1st–2nd century CE.\n\nThe Śātavāhanas were based from Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh as well as Junnar (Pune) and Prathisthan (Paithan) in Maharashtra. The territory of the empire covered large parts of India from the 1st century BCE onward. The Sātavāhanas started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty, but declared independence with its decline.\n\n\nThe Sātavāhanas are known for their patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism, which resulted in Buddhist monuments from Ellora (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) to Amaravati. They were one of the first Indian states to issue coins with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India.\n\n\nThey had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynasty of Magadha to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect large part of India against foreign invaders like the Sakas, Yavanas and Pahlavas. In particular, their struggles with the Western Kshatrapas went on for a long time. The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Yajna Sātakarni were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the Western Kshatrapas and to stop their expansion. In the 3rd century CE the empire was split into smaller states.[132]\n\n\n\n#### Trade and travels to India[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Silk Road transmission of Buddhism\n\n![](image)Silk Road and Spice trade, ancient trade routes that linked India with the Old World; carried goods and ideas between the ancient civilisations of the Old World and India. The land routes are red, and the water routes are blue.\nThe spice trade in Kerala attracted traders from all over the Old World to India. India's Southwest coastal port Muziris had established itself as a major spice trade centre from as early as 3,000 BCE, according to Sumerian records. Jewish traders arrived in Kochi, Kerala, India as early as 562 BCE.[133] The Greco-Roman world followed by trading along the incense route and the Roman-India routes.[134] During the 2nd century BCE Greek and Indian ships met to trade at Arabian ports such as Aden.[135] During the first millennium, the sea routes to India were controlled by the Indians and Ethiopians that became the maritime trading power of the Red Sea. Indian merchants involved in spice trade took Indian cuisine to Southeast Asia, where spice mixtures and curries became popular with the native inhabitants.[136]\nBuddhism entered China through the Silk Road in the 1st or 2nd century CE.[137] Hindu and Buddhist religious establishments of Southeast Asia came to be associated with the economic activity and commerce as patrons entrust large funds which would later be used to benefit the local economy by estate management, craftsmanship, promotion of trading activities. Buddhism in particular, travelled alongside the maritime trade, promoting coinage, art, and literacy.[138]\n\n\n\n#### Kushan Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kushan Empire\n\nKushan Empire\n![](image)\nKushan territories (full line) and maximum extent of Kushan dominions under Kanishka (dotted line), according to the Rabatak inscription.\n![](image)\nDepiction of the Buddha in Kanishka's coinage, Mathura art, 2nd century CE.\n\nThe Kushan Empire expanded out of what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the Indian subcontinent under the leadership of their first emperor, Kujula Kadphises, about the middle of the 1st century CE. The Kushans were possibly a Tocharian speaking tribe,[139] one of five branches of the Yuezhi confederation.[140][141] By the time of his grandson, Kanishka the Great, the empire spread to encompass much of Afghanistan,[142] and then the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.[143]\n\n\nEmperor Kanishka was a great patron of Buddhism; however, as Kushans expanded southward, the deities of their later coinage came to reflect its new Hindu majority.[144][145] Historian Vincent Smith said about Kanishka:\n\n\n\n\n> He played the part of a second Ashoka in the history of Buddhism.[146]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe empire linked the Indian Ocean maritime trade with the commerce of the Silk Road through the Indus valley, encouraging long-distance trade, particularly between China and Rome. The Kushans brought new trends to the budding and blossoming Gandhara art and Mathura art, which reached its peak during Kushan rule.[147] The period of peace under Kushan rule is known as *Pax Kushana*.\n\n\nBy the 3rd century, their empire in India was disintegrating and their last known great emperor was Vasudeva I.[148][149]\n\n\n\n### Classical period (c. 320 – 650 CE)[edit]\n\n\n#### Gupta Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gupta Empire\n\nFurther information: Meghadūta, Abhijñānaśākuntala, Kumārasambhava, Panchatantra, Aryabhatiya, Indian numerals, and Kama Sutra\n\nGupta Empire\n![](image)\nThe Gupta Empire around 420 CE at its peak territorial extent under Kumaragupta I.\n![](image)\nThe current structure of the Mahabodhi Temple dates to the Gupta era, 5th century CE. Marking the location where the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment.\n\nThe Gupta period was noted for cultural creativity, especially in literature, architecture, sculpture, and painting.[150] The Gupta period produced scholars such as Kalidasa, Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Vishnu Sharma, and Vatsyayana. The Gupta period marked a watershed of Indian culture: the Guptas performed Vedic sacrifices to legitimise their rule, but they also patronised Buddhism, an alternative to Brahmanical orthodoxy. The military exploits of the first three rulers – Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, and Chandragupta II – brought much of India under their leadership.[151] Science and political administration reached new heights during the Gupta era. Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural centre and established it as a base that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions.[152][153] The period of peace under Gupta rule is known as *Pax Gupta*.\n\n\nThe latter Guptas successfully resisted the northwestern kingdoms until the arrival of the Alchon Huns, who established themselves in Afghanistan by the first half of the 5th century CE, with their capital at Bamiyan.[154] However, much of the southern India including Deccan were largely unaffected by these events.[155][156]\n\n\n\n#### Vakataka Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vakataka Empire\n\nThe Vākāṭaka Empire originated from the Deccan in the mid-third century CE. Their state is believed to have extended from the southern edges of Malwa and Gujarat in the north to the Tungabhadra River in the south as well as from the Arabian Sea in the western to the edges of Chhattisgarh in the east. They were the most important successors of the Satavahanas in the Deccan, contemporaneous with the Guptas in northern India and succeeded by the Vishnukundina dynasty.\n\n\nThe Vakatakas are noted for having been patrons of the arts, architecture and literature. The rock-cut Buddhist viharas and chaityas of Ajanta Caves (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) were built under the patronage of Vakataka emperor, Harishena.[157][158]\n\n\n\n* ![The Ajanta Caves are 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monument built under the Vakatakas.](image)\n\nThe Ajanta Caves are 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monument built under the Vakatakas.\n* ![Buddhist monks praying in front of the Dagoba of Chaitya Cave 26 of the Ajanta Caves.](image)\n\nBuddhist monks praying in front of the Dagoba of Chaitya Cave 26 of the Ajanta Caves.\n* ![Buddhist \"Chaitya Griha\" or prayer hall, with a seated Buddha, Cave 26 of the Ajanta Caves.](image)\n\nBuddhist \"Chaitya Griha\" or prayer hall, with a seated Buddha, Cave 26 of the Ajanta Caves.\n* ![Many foreign ambassadors, representatives, and travelers are included as devotees attending the Buddha's descent from Trayastrimsa Heaven; painting from Cave 17 of the Ajanta Caves.](image)\n\nMany foreign ambassadors, representatives, and travelers are included as devotees attending the Buddha's descent from Trayastrimsa Heaven; painting from Cave 17 of the Ajanta Caves.\n\n#### Kamarupa Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kamarupa Kingdom\n\n![](image)Copper Plate Seal of Kamarupa Kings at Madan Kamdev ruins.\nSamudragupta's 4th-century Allahabad pillar inscription mentions Kamarupa (Western Assam)[159] and Davaka (Central Assam)[160] as frontier kingdoms of the Gupta Empire. Davaka was later absorbed by Kamarupa, which grew into a large kingdom that spanned from Karatoya river to near present Sadiya and covered the entire Brahmaputra valley, North Bengal, parts of Bangladesh and, at times Purnea and parts of West Bengal.[161]\n\n\nRuled by three dynasties Varmanas (c. 350–650 CE), Mlechchha dynasty (c. 655–900 CE) and Kamarupa-Palas (c. 900–1100 CE), from their capitals in present-day Guwahati (Pragjyotishpura), Tezpur (Haruppeswara) and North Gauhati (Durjaya) respectively. All three dynasties claimed their descent from Narakasura.[162] In the reign of the Varman king, Bhaskar Varman (c. 600–650 CE), the Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the region and recorded his travels. Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was somewhat extended until c. 1255 CE by the Lunar I (c. 1120–1185 CE) and Lunar II (c. 1155–1255 CE) dynasties.[163] The Kamarupa kingdom came to an end in the middle of the 13th century when the Khen dynasty under Sandhya of Kamarupanagara (North Guwahati), moved his capital to Kamatapur (North Bengal) after the invasion of Muslim Turks, and established the Kamata kingdom.[164]\n\n\n\n#### Pallava Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pallava Empire\n![](image)The Shore Temple (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) at Mahabalipuram built by Narasimhavarman II.The Pallavas, during the 4th to 9th centuries were, alongside the Guptas of the North, great patronisers of Sanskrit development in the South of the Indian subcontinent. The Pallava reign saw the first Sanskrit inscriptions in a script called Grantha.[165] Early Pallavas had different connexions to Southeast Asian countries. The Pallavas used Dravidian architecture to build some very important Hindu temples and academies in Mamallapuram, Kanchipuram and other places; their rule saw the rise of great poets. The practice of dedicating temples to different deities came into vogue followed by fine artistic temple architecture and sculpture style of Vastu Shastra.[166]\n\n\nPallavas reached the height of power during the reign of Mahendravarman I (571–630 CE) and Narasimhavarman I (630–668 CE) and dominated the Telugu and northern parts of the Tamil region until the end of the 9th century.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Kadamba Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kadamba Empire\n\n![](image)Kadamba *shikara* (tower) with *Kalasa* (pinnacle) on top, Doddagaddavalli.\nKadambas originated from Karnataka, was founded by Mayurasharma in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions. King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with help of some native tribes. The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma, a notable ruler with whom the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires, for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties (Kadambas of Goa, Kadambas of Halasi and Kadambas of Hangal).\n\n\n\n#### Empire of Harsha[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Harsha and Pushyabhuti dynasty\n\nHarsha ruled northern India from 606 to 647 CE. He was the son of Prabhakarvardhana and the younger brother of Rajyavardhana, who were members of the Vardhana dynasty and ruled Thanesar, in present-day Haryana.\n\n\n\n![](image)Coin of Emperor Harsha, c. 606–647 CE.[168]\nAfter the downfall of the prior Gupta Empire in the middle of the 6th century, North India reverted to smaller republics and monarchical states. The power vacuum resulted in the rise of the Vardhanas of Thanesar, who began uniting the republics and monarchies from the Punjab to central India. After the death of Harsha's father and brother, representatives of the empire crowned Harsha emperor in April 606 CE, giving him the title of Maharaja.[169] At the height of his power, his Empire covered much of North and Northwestern India, extended East until Kamarupa, and South until Narmada River; and eventually made Kannauj (in present Uttar Pradesh) his capital, and ruled until 647 CE.[170]\n\n\nThe peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a centre of cosmopolitanism, attracting scholars, artists and religious visitors.[170] During this time, Harsha converted to Buddhism from Surya worship.[171] The Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the court of Harsha and wrote a very favourable account of him, praising his justice and generosity.[170] His biography *Harshacharita* (\"Deeds of Harsha\") written by Sanskrit poet Banabhatta, describes his association with Thanesar and the palace with a two-storied *Dhavalagriha* (White Mansion).[172][173]\n\n\n\n## Early medieval period (mid 6th c.–1200 CE)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Medieval India, Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent, and Tripartite Struggle\n\nEarly medieval India began after the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE.[125] This period also covers the \"Late Classical Age\" of Hinduism,[174] which began after the end of the Gupta Empire,[174] and the collapse of the Empire of Harsha in the 7th century CE;[174] the beginning of Imperial Kannauj, leading to the Tripartite struggle; and ended in the 13th century with the rise of the Delhi Sultanate in Northern India[175] and the end of the Later Cholas with the death of Rajendra Chola III in 1279 in Southern India; however some aspects of the Classical period continued until the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in the south around the 17th century.\n\n\nFrom the fifth century to the thirteenth, Śrauta sacrifices declined, and initiatory traditions of Buddhism, Jainism or more commonly Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism expanded in royal courts.[176] This period produced some of India's finest art, considered the epitome of classical development, and the development of the main spiritual and philosophical systems which continued to be in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.\n\n\nIn the 7th century CE, Kumārila Bhaṭṭa formulated his school of Mimamsa philosophy and defended the position on Vedic rituals against Buddhist attacks. Scholars note Bhaṭṭa's contribution to the decline of Buddhism in India.[177] In the 8th century, Adi Shankara travelled across the Indian subcontinent to propagate and spread the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, which he consolidated; and is credited with unifying the main characteristics of the current thoughts in Hinduism.[178][179][180] He was a critic of both Buddhism and Minamsa school of Hinduism;[181][182][183][184] and founded mathas (monasteries) for the spread and development of Advaita Vedanta.[185] Muhammad bin Qasim's invasion of Sindh (modern Pakistan) in 711 CE witnessed further decline of Buddhism.[186]\n\n\nFrom the 8th to the 10th century, three dynasties contested for control of northern India: the Gurjara Pratiharas of Malwa, the Palas of Bengal, and the Rashtrakutas of the Deccan. The Sena dynasty would later assume control of the Pala Empire; the Gurjara Pratiharas fragmented into various states, notably the Paramaras of Malwa, the Chandelas of Bundelkhand, the Kalachuris of Mahakoshal, the Tomaras of Haryana, and the Chauhans of Rajputana, these states were some of the earliest Rajput kingdoms;[187] while the Rashtrakutas were annexed by the Western Chalukyas.[188] During this period, the Chaulukya dynasty emerged; the Chaulukyas constructed the Dilwara Temples, Modhera Sun Temple, Rani ki vav[189] in the style of Māru-Gurjara architecture, and their capital Anhilwara (modern Patan, Gujarat) was one of the largest cities in the Indian subcontinent, with the population estimated at 100,000 in 1000 CE.\n\n\nThe Chola Empire emerged as a major power during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I who successfully invaded parts of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka in the 11th century.[190] Lalitaditya Muktapida (r. 724–760 CE) was an emperor of the Kashmiri Karkoṭa dynasty, which exercised influence in northwestern India from 625 CE until 1003, and was followed by Lohara dynasty. Kalhana in his Rajatarangini credits king Lalitaditya with leading an aggressive military campaign in Northern India and Central Asia.[191][192][193]\n\n\nThe Hindu Shahi dynasty ruled portions of eastern Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, and Kashmir from the mid-7th century to the early 11th century. While in Odisha, the Eastern Ganga Empire rose to power; noted for the advancement of Hindu architecture, most notable being Jagannath Temple and Konark Sun Temple, as well as being patrons of art and literature.\n\n\n\n* ![Martand Sun Temple Central shrine, dedicated to the deity Surya, and built by the third ruler of the Karkota dynasty, Lalitaditya Muktapida, in the 8th century CE.](image)\n\nMartand Sun Temple Central shrine, dedicated to the deity Surya, and built by the third ruler of the Karkota dynasty, Lalitaditya Muktapida, in the 8th century CE.\n* ![Konark Sun Temple at Konark, Orissa, built by Narasimhadeva I (1238–1264 CE) of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.](image)\n\nKonark Sun Temple at Konark, Orissa, built by Narasimhadeva I (1238–1264 CE) of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.\n* ![Kandariya Mahadeva Temple in the Khajuraho complex was built by the Chandelas.](image)\n\nKandariya Mahadeva Temple in the Khajuraho complex was built by the Chandelas.\n* ![Jagannath Temple at Puri, built by Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.](image)\n\nJagannath Temple at Puri, built by Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.\n\n### Chalukya Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chalukya Empire\n\nThe Chalukya Empire ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries, as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \"Badami Chalukyas\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \"Chalukyan architecture\". The Chalukya dynasty ruled parts of southern and central India from Badami in Karnataka between 550 and 750, and then again from Kalyani between 970 and 1190.\n\n\n\n* ![Galaganatha Temple at Pattadakal complex (UNESCO World Heritage) is an example of Badami Chalukya architecture.](image)\n\nGalaganatha Temple at Pattadakal complex (UNESCO World Heritage) is an example of Badami Chalukya architecture.\n* ![Bhutanatha temple complex at Badami, next to a waterfall, during the monsoon.](image)\n\nBhutanatha temple complex at Badami, next to a waterfall, during the monsoon.\n* ![Vishnu image inside the Badami Cave Temple Complex.

Amoghavarsha was also an author and wrote Kavirajamarga, the earliest known Kannada work on poetics.[195][199] Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest example of which is seen in the Kailasanath Temple at Ellora. Other important contributions are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka.\n\n\nThe Arab traveller Suleiman described the Rashtrakuta Empire as one of the four great Empires of the world.[200] The Rashtrakuta period marked the beginning of the golden age of southern Indian mathematics. The great south Indian mathematician Mahāvīra had a huge impact on medieval south Indian mathematicians.[201] The Rashtrakuta rulers also patronised men of letters in a variety of languages.[195]\n\n\n\n* ![Kailasa temple, is one of the largest rock-cut ancient Hindu temples located in Ellora.](image)\n\nKailasa temple, is one of the largest rock-cut ancient Hindu temples located in Ellora.\n* ![Shikhara of Indra Sabha at Ellora Caves.](image)\n\nShikhara of Indra Sabha at Ellora Caves.\n* ![Statue of the Buddha seated.

Nagabhata I defeated the Arab army under Junaid and Tamin during the Umayyad campaigns in India.[202] Under Nagabhata II, the Gurjara-Pratiharas became the most powerful dynasty in northern India. He was succeeded by his son Ramabhadra, who ruled briefly before being succeeded by his son, Mihira Bhoja. Under Bhoja and his successor Mahendrapala I, the Pratihara Empire reached its peak of prosperity and power. By the time of Mahendrapala, its territory stretched from the border of Sindh in the west to Bihar in the east and from the Himalayas in the north to around the Narmada River in the south.[203] The expansion triggered a tripartite power struggle with the Rashtrakuta and Pala empires for control of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\nBy the end of the 10th century, several feudatories of the empire took advantage of the temporary weakness of the Gurjara-Pratiharas to declare their independence, notably the Paramaras of Malwa, the Chandelas of Bundelkhand, the Tomaras of Haryana, the Chauhans of Rajputana,[204] and the Kalachuris of Mahakoshal.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* ![One of the four entrances of the Teli ka Mandir.

Their capital was located at Khayaragarh in Shahabad district. Pratapdhavala and Shri Pratapa were king of the dynasty.[207]\n\n![](image)Rohtasgarh Fort\n### Pala Empire[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Excavated ruins of Nalanda, a centre of Buddhist learning from 450 to 1193 CE.\nMain article: Pala Empire\n\nThe Pala Empire was founded by Gopala I.[208][209][210] It was ruled by a Buddhist dynasty from Bengal. The Palas reunified Bengal after the fall of Shashanka's Gauda Kingdom.[211]\n\n\nThe Palas were followers of the Mahayana and Tantric schools of Buddhism,[212] they also patronised Shaivism and Vaishnavism.[213] The empire reached its peak under Dharmapala and Devapala. Dharmapala is believed to have conquered Kanauj and extended his sway up to the farthest limits of India in the northwest.[213]\n\n\nThe Pala Empire can be considered as the golden era of Bengal.[214] Dharmapala founded the Vikramashila and revived Nalanda,[213] considered one of the first great universities in recorded history. Nalanda reached its height under the patronage of the Pala Empire.[214][215] The Palas also built many viharas. They maintained close cultural and commercial ties with countries of Southeast Asia and Tibet. Sea trade added greatly to the prosperity of the Pala Empire.\n\n\n\n### Cholas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chola dynasty\n\n![](image)Chola Empire under Rajendra Chola, c. 1030 CE.\nMedieval Cholas rose to prominence during the middle of the 9th century CE and established the greatest empire South India had seen.[216] They successfully united the South India under their rule and through their naval strength extended their influence in the Southeast Asian countries such as Srivijaya.[190] Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra Chola I, Rajadhiraja Chola, Virarajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola I the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia.[217][218] Rajendra Chola I's navies occupied the sea coasts from Burma to Vietnam,[219] the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Lakshadweep (Laccadive) islands, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula. The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by the occupation of cities of the maritime empire of Srivijaya in Southeast Asia, as well as by the repeated embassies to China.[220]\n\n\nThey dominated the political affairs of Sri Lanka for over two centuries through repeated invasions and occupation. They also had continuing trade contacts with the Arabs and the Chinese empire.[221] Rajaraja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola I gave political unity to the whole of Southern India and established the Chola Empire as a respected sea power.[222] Under the Cholas, the South India reached new heights of excellence in art, religion and literature. In all of these spheres, the Chola period marked the culmination of movements that had begun in an earlier age under the Pallavas. Monumental architecture in the form of majestic temples and sculpture in stone and bronze reached a finesse never before achieved in India.[223]\n\n\n\n![](image)Srirangam Ranganathaswamy Temple is the world's largest functioning Hindu temple.[224] present in Tamil Nadu, India. The temple is a significant archaeological and epigraphical site, providing a historic window into the early and mid medieval South Indian society and culture. The temple is mentioned in the Ramayana,[225] Mahabharatha, Sangam literature(500 BCE to the 300 CE[226])and Various books. Beyond the ancient textual history, archaeological evidence such as inscriptions refer to this temple, and these stone inscriptions are from late **100 BCE to 100 CE**.[*citation needed*] Hence, making it one of the oldest surviving active temple complexes in South India.\n* ![The granite gopuram (tower) of Brihadeeswarar Temple, 1010 CE.](image)\n\nThe granite gopuram (tower) of Brihadeeswarar Temple, 1010 CE.\n* ![Chariot detail at Airavatesvara Temple built by Rajaraja Chola II in the 12th century CE.](image)\n\nChariot detail at Airavatesvara Temple built by Rajaraja Chola II in the 12th century CE.\n* ![The pyramidal structure above the sanctum at Brihadisvara Temple.](image)\n\nThe pyramidal structure above the sanctum at Brihadisvara Temple.\n* ![Brihadeeswara Temple Entrance Gopurams at Thanjavur.](image)\n\nBrihadeeswara Temple Entrance Gopurams at Thanjavur.\n\n### Western Chalukya Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Chalukya Empire\n\nThe Western Chalukya Empire ruled most of the western Deccan, South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries.[227] Vast areas between the Narmada River in the north and Kaveri River in the south came under Chalukya control.[227] During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuris, were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the latter half of the 12th century.[228]\n\n\nThe Western Chalukyas developed an architectural style known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali, Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri, and the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi.[229] This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language of Kannada, and Sanskrit like the philosopher and statesman Basava and the great mathematician Bhāskara II.[230][231]\n\n\n\n* ![Shrine outer wall and Dravida style superstructure (shikhara) at Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri.](image)\n\nShrine outer wall and *Dravida* style superstructure (*shikhara*) at Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri.\n* ![Ornate entrance to the closed hall from the south at Kalleshvara Temple at Bagali.](image)\n\nOrnate entrance to the closed hall from the south at Kalleshvara Temple at Bagali.\n* ![Shrine wall relief, molding frieze and miniature decorative tower in Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti.](image)\n\nShrine wall relief, molding frieze and miniature decorative tower in Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti.\n* ![Rear view showing lateral entrances of the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi.](image)\n\nRear view showing lateral entrances of the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi.\n\n## Late medieval period (c. 1200–1526 CE)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medieval India\n\nSee also: Muslim kingdoms in the Indian subcontinent\n\nThe late medieval period is marked by repeated invasions of the Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans,[232][233] the rule of the Delhi sultanate, and by the growth of other dynasties and empires, built upon military technology of the Sultanate.[234]\n\n\n\n### Delhi Sultanate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Delhi Sultanate\n\n![](image)The Delhi Sultanate reached its zenith under the Turko-Indian Tughlaq dynasty.[235]\nThe Delhi Sultanate was a series of successive Islamic states based in Delhi, ruled by several dynasties of Turkic, Turko-Indian[236] and Pashtun origins.[237] It ruled large parts of the Indian subcontinent from the 13th to the early 16th century.[238] In the 12th and 13th centuries, Central Asian Turks invaded parts of northern India and established the Delhi Sultanate in the former Hindu holdings.[239] The subsequent Mamluk dynasty of Delhi managed to conquer large areas of northern India, while the Khalji dynasty conquered most of central India while forcing the principal Hindu kingdoms of South India to become vassal states.[238]\n\n\nThe Sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting \"Indo-Muslim\" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of Urdu was born during the Delhi Sultanate period. The Delhi Sultanate is the only Indo-Islamic empire to enthrone one of the few female rulers in India, Razia Sultana (1236–1240).\n\n\nWhile initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system, drawing India into a wider international network, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society.[240] However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large-scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent.[241]\n\n\nThe Mongol invasions of India were successfully repelled by the Delhi Sultanate during the rule of Alauddin Khalji. A major factor in their success was their Turkic Mamluk slave army, who were highly skilled in the same style of nomadic cavalry warfare as the Mongols. It is possible that the Mongol Empire may have expanded into India were it not for the Delhi Sultanate's role in repelling them.[242] By repeatedly repulsing the Mongol raiders, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[243][242]\n\n\nA Turco-Mongol conqueror in Central Asia, Timur (Tamerlane), attacked the reigning Sultan Nasir-u Din Mehmud of the Tughlaq dynasty in the north Indian city of Delhi.[244] The Sultan's army was defeated on 17 December 1398. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins after Timur's army had killed and plundered for three days and nights. He ordered the whole city to be sacked except for the sayyids, scholars, and the \"other Muslims\" (artists); 100,000 war prisoners were put to death in one day.[245] The Sultanate suffered significantly from the sacking of Delhi. Though revived briefly under the Lodi dynasty, it was but a shadow of the former.\n\n\n\n* ![Qutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, whose construction was begun by Qutb ud-Din Aibak, the first Sultan of Delhi.](image)\n\nQutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, whose construction was begun by Qutb ud-Din Aibak, the first Sultan of Delhi.\n* ![Dargahs of Sufi-saint Nizamuddin Auliya, and poet and musician Amir Khusro in Delhi.](image)\n\nDargahs of Sufi-saint Nizamuddin Auliya, and poet and musician Amir Khusro in Delhi.\n* ![The grave of Razia, the Sultana of Delhi, from 1236 CE to 1240 CE, the only female ruler of a major realm on the Indian subcontinent until modern times.[citation needed]](image)\n\nThe grave of Razia, the Sultana of Delhi, from 1236 CE to 1240 CE, the only female ruler of a major realm on the Indian subcontinent until modern times.[*citation needed*]\n* ![Mausoleum of Ghiyasuddin Tughluq in Tughluqabad.](image)\n\nMausoleum of Ghiyasuddin Tughluq in Tughluqabad.\n* ![Lodhi Gardens in Delhi.](image)\n\nLodhi Gardens in Delhi.\n\n### Vijayanagara Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vijayanagara Empire\n\n![](image)Map of the Sangama dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire\nThe Vijayanagara Empire was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty,[246] which originated as a political heir of the Hoysala Empire, Kakatiya Empire,[247] and the Pandyan Empire.[248] The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the south Indian powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India.[249]\n\n\nIn the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of *Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara* (\"master of the eastern and western seas\"). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of Arcot, the Reddys of Kondavidu, and the Sultan of Madurai and had gained control over Goa in the west and the Tungabhadra-Krishna doab in the north.[250][251]\n\n\nHarihara II, the second son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the kingdom beyond the Krishna River and brought the whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella.[252] The next ruler, Deva Raya I, emerged successful against the Gajapatis of Odisha and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation.[253] Italian traveler Niccolo de Conti wrote of him as the most powerful ruler of India.[254] Deva Raya II succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was possibly the most capable of the Sangama Dynasty rulers.[255] He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the Zamorin of Calicut and Quilon in the south. He invaded the island of Sri Lanka and became overlord of the kings of Burma at Pegu and Tanasserim.[256][257][258]\n\n\nThe Vijayanagara Emperors were tolerant of all religions and sects, as writings by foreign visitors show.[259] The kings used titles such as *Gobrahamana Pratipalanacharya* (*literally*, \"protector of cows and Brahmins\") and *Hindurayasuratrana* (*lit*, \"upholder of Hindu faith\") that testified to their intention of protecting Hinduism and yet were at the same time staunchly Islamicate in their court ceremonials and dress.[260] The empire's founders, Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, were devout Shaivas (worshippers of Shiva), but made grants to the Vaishnava order of Sringeri with Vidyaranya as their patron saint, and designated *Varaha* (an avatar of Vishnu) as their emblem.[261] Nobles from Central Asia's Timurid kingdoms also came to Vijayanagara.[262] The later Saluva and Tuluva kings were Vaishnava by faith, but worshipped at the feet of Lord Virupaksha (Shiva) at Hampi as well as Lord Venkateshwara (Vishnu) at Tirupati.[263] A Sanskrit work, *Jambavati Kalyanam* by King Krishnadevaraya, called Lord Virupaksha *Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani* (\"protective jewel of Karnata Empire\").[264] The kings patronised the saints of the dvaita order (philosophy of dualism) of Madhvacharya at Udupi.[265]\n\n\n\n* ![An 1868 photograph of the ruins of the Vijayanagara Empire at Hampi, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site[266]](image)\n\nAn 1868 photograph of the ruins of the Vijayanagara Empire at Hampi, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site[266]\n* ![Gajashaala or elephant's stable, built by the Vijayanagar rulers for their war elephants.[267]](image)\n\n*Gajashaala* or elephant's stable, built by the Vijayanagar rulers for their war elephants.[267]\n* ![Vijayanagara marketplace at Hampi, along with the sacred tank located on the side of Krishna temple](image)\n\nVijayanagara marketplace at Hampi, along with the sacred tank located on the side of Krishna temple\n* ![Stone temple car in Vitthala Temple at Hampi](image)\n\nStone temple car in Vitthala Temple at Hampi\n\nThe empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of Hindu temple construction. South Indian mathematics flourished under the protection of the Vijayanagara Empire in Kerala. The south Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama founded the famous Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics in the 14th century which produced a lot of great south Indian mathematicians like Parameshvara, Nilakantha Somayaji and Jyeṣṭhadeva.[268] Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation.[269] The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form.[270]\n\n\nVijayanagara went into decline after the defeat in the Battle of Talikota (1565). After the death of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the destroyed Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire.[271] Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life until his death in 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others.[272][273][274] During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka, Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee – all of which declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries.[272]\n\n\n\n### Other kingdoms[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Guhila dynasty and Kingdom of Mewar\n\n* ![Vijaya Stambha (Tower of Victory)](image)\n\n*Vijaya Stambha* (Tower of Victory)\n* ![Temple inside Chittorgarh fort](image)\n\nTemple inside Chittorgarh fort\n* ![The Man Singh (Manasimha) palace at the Gwalior fort](image)\n\nThe Man Singh (Manasimha) palace at the Gwalior fort\n* ![Chinese manuscript Tribute Giraffe with Attendant, depicting a giraffe presented by Bengali envoys in the name of Sultan Saifuddin Hamza Shah of Bengal to the Yongle Emperor of Ming China.](image)\n\nChinese manuscript *Tribute Giraffe with Attendant*, depicting a giraffe presented by Bengali envoys in the name of Sultan Saifuddin Hamza Shah of Bengal to the Yongle Emperor of Ming China.\n* ![Mahmud Gawan Madrasa was built by Mahmud Gawan, the Wazir of the Bahmani Sultanate as the centre of religious as well as secular education.](image)\n\nMahmud Gawan Madrasa was built by Mahmud Gawan, the Wazir of the Bahmani Sultanate as the centre of religious as well as secular education.\n* ![15th century copper plate grant of Gajapati king Purushottama Deva](image)\n\n15th century copper plate grant of Gajapati king Purushottama Deva\n\nFor two and a half centuries from the mid-13th century, politics in Northern India was dominated by the Delhi Sultanate, and in Southern India by the Vijayanagar Empire. However, there were other regional powers present as well. After fall of Pala Empire, the Chero dynasty ruled much of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand from 12th CE to 18th CE.[275][276][277] The Reddy dynasty successfully defeated the Delhi Sultanate and extended their rule from Cuttack in the north to Kanchi in the south, eventually being absorbed into the expanding Vijayanagara Empire.[278]\n\n\nIn the north, the Rajput kingdoms remained the dominant force in Western and Central India. The Mewar dynasty under Maharana Hammir defeated and captured Muhammad Tughlaq with the Bargujars as his main allies. Tughlaq had to pay a huge ransom and relinquish all of Mewar's lands. After this event, the Delhi Sultanate did not attack Chittor for a few hundred years. The Rajputs re-established their independence, and Rajput states were established as far east as Bengal and north into the Punjab. The Tomaras established themselves at Gwalior, and Man Singh Tomar reconstructed the Gwalior Fort.[279] During this period, Mewar emerged as the leading Rajput state; and Rana Kumbha expanded his kingdom at the expense of the Sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat.[279][280] The next great Rajput ruler, Rana Sanga of Mewar, became the principal player in Northern India. His objectives grew in scope – he planned to conquer Delhi. But, his defeat in the Battle of Khanwa consolidated the new Mughal dynasty in India.[279] The Mewar dynasty under Maharana Udai Singh II faced further defeat by Mughal emperor Akbar, with their capital Chittor being captured. Due to this event, Udai Singh II founded Udaipur, which became the new capital of the Mewar kingdom. His son, Maharana Pratap of Mewar, firmly resisted the Mughals. Akbar sent many missions against him. He survived to ultimately gain control of all of Mewar, excluding the Chittor Fort.[281]\n\n\nIn the south, the Bahmani Sultanate was the chief rival of the Vijayanagara, and frequently created difficulties for the Vijayanagara.[282] In the early 16th century Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagar Empire defeated the last remnant of Bahmani Sultanate power,[283] resulting it being split into five small Deccan sultanates.[284] In 1490, Ahmadnagar declared independence, followed by Bijapur and Berar in the same year; Golkonda became independent in 1518 and Bidar in 1528.[285] Although generally rivals, they did ally against the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, permanently weakening Vijayanagar in the Battle of Talikota.\n\n\nIn the East, the Gajapati Kingdom remained a strong regional power to reckon with, associated with a high point in the growth of regional culture and architecture. Under Kapilendradeva, Gajapatis became an empire stretching from the lower Ganga in the north to the Kaveri in the south.[286] In Northeast India, the Ahom Kingdom was a major power for six centuries;[287][288] led by Lachit Borphukan, the Ahoms decisively defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Saraighat during the Ahom-Mughal conflicts.[289] Further east in Northeastern India was the Kingdom of Manipur, which ruled from their seat of power at Kangla Fort and developed a sophisticated Hindu Gaudiya Vaishnavite culture.[290][291][292]\n\n\nThe Sultanate of Bengal was the dominant power of the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, with a network of mint towns spread across the region. It was a Sunni Muslim monarchy with Indo-Turkic, Arab, Abyssinian and Bengali Muslim elites. The sultanate was known for its religious pluralism where non-Muslim communities co-existed peacefully. The Bengal Sultanate had a circle of vassal states, including Odisha in the southwest, Arakan in the southeast, and Tripura in the east. In the early 16th century, the Bengal Sultanate reached the peak of its territorial growth with control over Kamrup and Kamata in the northeast and Jaunpur and Bihar in the west. It was reputed as a thriving trading nation and one of Asia's strongest states. The Bengal Sultanate was described by contemporary European and Chinese visitors as a relatively prosperous kingdom and the \"richest country to trade with\". The Bengal Sultanate left a strong architectural legacy. Buildings from the period show foreign influences merged into a distinct Bengali style. The Bengal Sultanate was also the largest and most prestigious authority among the independent medieval Muslim-ruled states in the history of Bengal. Its decline began with an interregnum by the Suri Empire, followed by Mughal conquest and disintegration into petty kingdoms.\n\n\n\n### Bhakti movement and Sikhism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bhakti movement, Buddhism in India, and Sikhism\n\nSee also: History of Sikhism\n\n![](image)The Dasam Granth (above) was composed by Sikh Guru Gobind Singh.\nThe Bhakti movement refers to the theistic devotional trend that emerged in medieval Hinduism[293] and later revolutionised in Sikhism.[294] It originated in the seventh-century south India (now parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and spread northwards.[293] It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE.[295]\n\n\n\n* The Bhakti movement regionally developed around different gods and goddesses, such as Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism (Shakti goddesses), and Smartism.[296][297][298] The movement was inspired by many poet-saints, who championed a wide range of philosophical positions ranging from theistic dualism of Dvaita to absolute monism of Advaita Vedanta.[299][300]\n* Sikhism is a monotheistic and panentheistic religion based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak, the first Guru,[301] and the ten successive Sikh gurus. After the death of the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, the Sikh scripture, Guru Granth Sahib, became the literal embodiment of the eternal, impersonal Guru, where the scripture's word serves as the spiritual guide for Sikhs.[302][303][304]\n* Buddhism in India flourished in the Himalayan kingdoms of Namgyal Kingdom in Ladakh, Sikkim Kingdom in Sikkim, and Chutia Kingdom in Arunachal Pradesh of the Late medieval period.\n\n\n* ![Rang Ghar, built by Pramatta Singha in Ahom kingdom's capital Rangpur, is one of the earliest pavilions of outdoor stadia in the Indian subcontinent.](image)\n\nRang Ghar, built by Pramatta Singha in Ahom kingdom's capital Rangpur, is one of the earliest pavilions of outdoor stadia in the Indian subcontinent.\n* ![Chittor Fort is the largest fort on the Indian subcontinent; it is one of the six Hill Forts of Rajasthan.](image)\n\nChittor Fort is the largest fort on the Indian subcontinent; it is one of the six Hill Forts of Rajasthan.\n* ![Ranakpur Jain temple was built in the 15th century with the support of the Rajput state of Mewar.](image)\n\nRanakpur Jain temple was built in the 15th century with the support of the Rajput state of Mewar.\n* ![Gol Gumbaz built by the Bijapur Sultanate, has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia.](image)\n\nGol Gumbaz built by the Bijapur Sultanate, has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia.\n\n## Early modern period (c. 1526–1858 CE)[edit]\n\n\nThe early modern period of Indian history is dated from 1526 CE to 1858 CE, corresponding to the rise and fall of the Mughal Empire, which inherited from the Timurid Renaissance. During this age India's economy expanded, relative peace was maintained and arts were patronized. This period witnessed the further development of Indo-Islamic architecture;[305][306] the growth of Marathas and Sikhs enabled them to rule significant regions of India in the waning days of the Mughal empire.[14] With the discovery of the Cape route in the 1500s, the first Europeans to arrive by sea and establish themselves, were the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay.[307]\n\n\n\n### Mughal Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mughal Empire\n\nSee also: Bengal Subah, Muslin trade in Bengal, Mughal architecture, Army of the Mughal Empire, Mughal clothing, and Mughal painting\n\nMughal Empire\n![](image)\nA map of the Mughal Empire at its greatest geographical extent, c. 1700 CE\n![](image)\n\"The Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.\" UNESCO World Heritage Site declaration, 1983.[308]\n\nIn 1526, Babur swept across the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal Empire, which at its zenith covered much of South Asia.[309] However, his son Humayun was defeated by the Afghan warrior Sher Shah Suri in 1540, and Humayun was forced to retreat to Kabul. After Sher Shah's death, his son Islam Shah Suri and his Hindu general Hemu Vikramaditya established secular rule in North India from Delhi until 1556, when Akbar (r. 1556–1605), grandson of Babur, defeated Hemu in the Second Battle of Panipat on 6 November 1556 after winning Battle of Delhi. Akbar tried to establish a good relationship with the Hindus. Akbar declared \"Amari\" or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism. He rolled back the *jizya* tax for non-Muslims. The Mughal emperors married local royalty, allied themselves with local *maharajas*, and attempted to fuse their Turko-Persian culture with ancient Indian styles, creating a unique Indo-Persian culture and Indo-Saracenic architecture.\n\n\nAkbar married a Rajput princess, Mariam-uz-Zamani, and they had a son, Jahangir (r. 1605–1627).[310] Jahangir followed his father's policy. The Mughal dynasty ruled most of the Indian subcontinent by 1600. The reign of Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) was the golden age of Mughal architecture. He erected several large monuments, the most famous of which is the Taj Mahal at Agra.\n\n\nIt was one of the largest empires to have existed in the Indian subcontinent,[311] and surpassed China to become the world's largest economic power, controlling 24.4% of the world economy,[312] and the world leader in manufacturing,[313] producing 25% of global industrial output.[314] The economic and demographic upsurge was stimulated by Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production,[315] and a relatively high degree of urbanisation.[316]\n\n\n\nOther Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n* ![The Agra Fort showing the river Yamuna and the Taj Mahal in the background](image)\n\nThe Agra Fort showing the river Yamuna and the Taj Mahal in the background\n* ![Fatehpur Sikri, near Agra, showing Buland Darwaza, the complex built by Akbar, the third Mughal emperor.](image)\n\nFatehpur Sikri, near Agra, showing Buland Darwaza, the complex built by Akbar, the third Mughal emperor.\n* ![Humayun's Tomb in Delhi, built in 1570 CE.](image)\n\nHumayun's Tomb in Delhi, built in 1570 CE.\n* ![The Red Fort, Delhi, its construction begun in 1639 CE, and ended in 1648 CE.](image)\n\nThe Red Fort, Delhi, its construction begun in 1639 CE, and ended in 1648 CE.\n\nThe Mughal Empire reached the zenith of its territorial expanse during the reign of Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707), under whose reign the proto-industrialization[317] led to India surpassing Qing China as the world's largest economy.[318][319] Aurangzeb was less tolerant than his predecessors, reintroducing the *jizya* tax and destroying several historical temples, while at the same time building more Hindu temples than he destroyed,[320] employing significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors, and advancing administrators based on ability rather than religion.[321] However, he is often blamed for the erosion of the tolerant syncretic tradition of his predecessors, as well as increasing religious controversy and centralisation. The English East India Company suffered a defeat in the Anglo-Mughal War.[322][323]\n\n\n\n![](image)18th-century political formation in India\nThe Mughals suffered several blows due to invasions from Marathas, Rajputs, Jats and Afghans. In 1737, the Maratha general Bajirao of the Maratha Empire invaded and plundered Delhi. Under the general Amir Khan Umrao Al Udat, the Mughal Emperor sent 8,000 troops to drive away the 5,000 Maratha cavalry soldiers. Baji Rao easily routed the novice Mughal general. In 1737, in the final defeat of Mughal Empire, the commander-in-chief of the Mughal Army, Nizam-ul-mulk, was routed at Bhopal by the Maratha army. This essentially brought an end to the Mughal Empire. While Bharatpur State under Jat ruler Suraj Mal, overran the Mughal garrison at Agra and plundered the city.[324] In 1739, Nader Shah, emperor of Iran, defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Karnal.[325] After this victory, Nader captured and sacked Delhi, carrying away treasures including the Peacock Throne.[326] Mughal rule was further weakened by constant native Indian resistance; Banda Singh Bahadur led the Sikh Khalsa against Mughal religious oppression; Hindu Rajas of Bengal, Pratapaditya and Raja Sitaram Ray revolted; and Maharaja Chhatrasal, of Bundela Rajputs, fought the Mughals and established the Panna State.[327] The Mughal dynasty was reduced to puppet rulers by 1757. Vadda Ghalughara took place under the Muslim provincial government based at Lahore to wipe out the Sikhs, with 30,000 Sikhs being killed, an offensive that had begun with the Mughals, with the Chhota Ghallughara,[328] and lasted several decades under its Muslim successor states.[329]\n\n\n\n### Maratha Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Maratha Empire\n\nFurther information: Maratha Army, Maratha Navy, and Battles involving the Maratha Empire\n\nMaratha Empire\n![](image)\nMaratha Empire at its zenith in 1760 (yellow area), covering much of the Indian subcontinent, stretching from South India to present-day Pakistan.\n![](image)\nShaniwarwada palace fort in Pune, the seat of the Peshwa rulers of the Maratha Empire until 1818.\n\nThe Maratha kingdom was founded and consolidated by Chatrapati Shivaji.[330] However, the credit for making the Marathas formidable power nationally goes to *Peshwa* (chief minister) Bajirao I. Historian K.K. Datta wrote that Bajirao I \"may very well be regarded as the second founder of the Maratha Empire\".[331]\n\n\nIn the early 18th century, under the Peshwas, the Marathas consolidated and ruled over much of South Asia. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending Mughal rule in India.[332][333][334] In 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in their capital, in the Battle of Delhi. The Marathas continued their military campaigns against the Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and the Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. By 1760, the domain of the Marathas stretched across most of the Indian subcontinent.[*citation needed*] The Marathas even attempted to capture Delhi and discussed putting Vishwasrao Peshwa on the throne there in place of the Mughal emperor.[335]\n\n\nThe Maratha empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south,[336] to Peshawar (modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan[337] [note 2]) in the north, and Bengal in the east. The Northwestern expansion of the Marathas was stopped after the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). However, the Maratha authority in the north was re-established within a decade under Peshwa Madhavrao I.[339]\n\n\nUnder Madhavrao I, the strongest knights were granted semi-autonomy, creating a confederacy of United Maratha states under the Gaekwads of Baroda, the Holkars of Indore and Malwa, the Scindias of Gwalior and Ujjain, the Bhonsales of Nagpur and the Puars of Dhar and Dewas. In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune, which led to the First Anglo-Maratha War, resulting in a Maratha victory.[340] The Marathas remained a major power in India until their defeat in the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha Wars (1805–1818).\n\n\n\n### Sikh Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sikh Empire\n\nSee also: Sikh architecture and Sikh Khalsa Army\n\nSikh Empire under Ranjit Singh\n![](image)\nThe Sikh empire at its greatest geographical extent, ca. 1839\n![](image)\nThe Harmandir Sahib is the preeminent pilgrimage site of Sikhism. Ranjit Singh rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, overlaid the sanctum with gold foil in 1830.[341]\n\nThe Sikh Empire was a political entity that governed the Northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent, based around the Punjab region, from 1799 to 1849. It was forged, on the foundations of the Khalsa, under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh consolidated much of northern India into an empire using his Sikh Khalsa Army, trained in European military techniques and equipped with modern military technologies. Ranjit Singh proved himself to be a master strategist and selected well-qualified generals for his army. He successfully ended the Afghan-Sikh Wars. In stages, he added central Punjab, the provinces of Multan and Kashmir, and the Peshawar Valley to his empire.[342][343]\n\n\nAt its peak in the 19th century, the empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Sindh in the south, running along Sutlej river to Himachal in the east. After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire weakened, leading to conflict with the British East India Company. The First Anglo-Sikh War and Second Anglo-Sikh War marked the downfall of the Sikh Empire, making it among the last areas of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by the British.\n\n\n\n### Other kingdoms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Territories of India in 1763\nThe Kingdom of Mysore in southern India expanded to its greatest extent under Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan in the later half of the 18th century. Under their rule, Mysore fought series of wars against the Marathas and British or their combined forces. The Maratha–Mysore War ended in April 1787, following the finalizing of *treaty of Gajendragad*, in which Tipu Sultan was obligated to pay tribute to the Marathas. Concurrently, the Anglo-Mysore Wars took place, where the Mysoreans used the Mysorean rockets. The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798–1799) saw the death of Tipu. Mysore's alliance with the French was seen as a threat to the British East India Company, and Mysore was attacked from all four sides. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas launched an invasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory at the Siege of Seringapatam (1799).\n\n\nHyderabad was founded by the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda in 1591. Following a brief Mughal rule, Asif Jah, a Mughal official, seized control of Hyderabad and declared himself Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad in 1724. The Nizams lost considerable territory and paid tribute to the Maratha Empire after being routed in multiple battles, such as the Battle of Palkhed.[344] However, the Nizams maintained their sovereignty from 1724 until 1948 through paying tributes to the Marathas, and later, being vassels of the British. Hyderabad State became a princely state in British India in 1798.\n\n\nThe Nawabs of Bengal had become the de facto rulers of Bengal following the decline of Mughal Empire. However, their rule was interrupted by Marathas who carried out six expeditions in Bengal from 1741 to 1748, as a result of which Bengal became a tributary state of Marathas. On 23 June 1757, Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal was betrayed in the Battle of Plassey by Mir Jafar. He lost to the British, who took over the charge of Bengal in 1757, installed Mir Jafar on the *Masnad* (throne) and established itself to a political power in Bengal.[345] In 1765 the system of Dual Government was established, in which the Nawabs ruled on behalf of the British and were mere puppets to the British. In 1772 the system was abolished and Bengal was brought under the direct control of the British. In 1793, when the *Nizamat* (governorship) of the Nawab was also taken away, they remained as mere pensioners of the British East India Company.[346][347]\n\n\nIn the 18th century, the whole of Rajputana was virtually subdued by the Marathas. The Second Anglo-Maratha War distracted the Marathas from 1807 to 1809, but afterward Maratha domination of Rajputana resumed. In 1817, the British went to war with the Pindaris, raiders who were fled in Maratha territory, which quickly became the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and the British government offered its protection to the Rajput rulers from the Pindaris and the Marathas. By the end of 1818 similar treaties had been executed between the other Rajput states and Britain. The Maratha Sindhia ruler of Gwalior gave up the district of Ajmer-Merwara to the British, and Maratha influence in Rajasthan came to an end.[348] Most of the Rajput princes remained loyal to Britain in the Revolt of 1857, and few political changes were made in Rajputana until Indian independence in 1947. The Rajputana Agency contained more than 20 princely states, most notable being Udaipur State, Jaipur State, Bikaner State and Jodhpur State.\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Maratha Empire, many Maratha dynasties and states became vassals in a subsidiary alliance with the British. With the decline of the Sikh Empire, after the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, under the terms of the Treaty of Amritsar, the British government sold Kashmir to Maharaja Gulab Singh and the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, the second-largest princely state in British India, was created by the Dogra dynasty.[349][350] While in Eastern and Northeastern India, the Hindu and Buddhist states of Cooch Behar Kingdom, Twipra Kingdom and Kingdom of Sikkim were annexed by the British and made vassal princely state.\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Polygar states emerged in Southern India; and managed to weather invasions and flourished until the Polygar Wars, where they were defeated by the British East India Company forces.[351] Around the 18th century, the Kingdom of Nepal was formed by Rajput rulers.[352]\n\n\n\n### European exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial India\n\n![](image)The route followed in Vasco da Gama's first voyage (1497–1499).\nIn 1498, a Portuguese fleet under Vasco da Gama discovered a new sea route from Europe to India, which paved the way for direct Indo-European commerce. The Portuguese soon set up trading posts in Velha Goa, Damaon, Dio island, and Bombay. The Portuguese instituted the Goa Inquisition, where new Indian converts were punished for suspected heresy against Christianity and non-Christians were condemned.[353] Goa remained the main Portuguese territory until it was annexed by India in 1961.[354]\n\n\nThe next to arrive were the Dutch, with their main base in Ceylon. They established ports in Malabar. However, their expansion into India was halted after their defeat in the Battle of Colachel by the Kingdom of Travancore during the Travancore-Dutch War. The Dutch never recovered from the defeat and no longer posed a large colonial threat to India.[355][356]\n\n\nThe internal conflicts among Indian kingdoms gave opportunities to the European traders to gradually establish political influence and appropriate lands. Following the Dutch, the British—who set up in the west coast port of Surat in 1619—and the French both established trading outposts in India. Although continental European powers controlled various coastal regions of southern and eastern India during the ensuing century, they eventually lost all their territories in India to the British, with the exception of the French outposts of Pondichéry and Chandernagore,[357] and the Portuguese colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu.[358]\n\n\n\n### East India Company rule in India[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: East India Company and Company rule in India\n\nIndia under East India Company rule\n![](image)\nIndia in 1765 and 1805 showing East India Company Territories in pink.\n![](image)\nIndia in 1837 and 1857 showing East India Company (pink) and other territories\n\nThe English East India Company was founded in 1600. It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a factory in Masulipatnam on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and a grant of rights by the Mughal emperor Jahangir to establish a factory in Surat in 1612. In 1640, after receiving similar permission from the Vijayanagara ruler farther south, a second factory was established in Madras on the southeastern coast. The islet of *Bom Bahia* in present-day Mumbai (Bombay), was a Portuguese outpost not far from Surat, it was presented to Charles II of England as dowry, in his marriage to Catherine of Braganza; Charles in turn leased Bombay to the Company in 1668. Two decades later, the company established a trade post in the River Ganges delta. During this time other companies established by the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and Danish were similarly expanding in the subcontinent.\n\n\nThe company's victory under Robert Clive in the 1757 Battle of Plassey and another victory in the 1764 Battle of Buxar (in Bihar), consolidated the company's power, and forced emperor Shah Alam II to appoint it the *diwan*, or revenue collector, of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The company thus became the *de facto* ruler of large areas of the lower Gangetic plain by 1773. It also proceeded by degrees to expand its dominions around Bombay and Madras. The Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766–99) and the Anglo-Maratha Wars (1772–1818) left it in control of large areas of India south of the Sutlej River. With the defeat of the Marathas, no native power represented a threat for the company any longer.[359]\n\n\nThe expansion of the company's power chiefly took two forms. The first of these was the outright annexation of Indian states and subsequent direct governance of the underlying regions that collectively came to comprise British India. The annexed regions included the North-Western Provinces (comprising Rohilkhand, Gorakhpur, and the Doab) (1801), Delhi (1803), Assam (Ahom Kingdom 1828) and Sindh (1843). Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir were annexed after the Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1849–56 (Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General). However, Kashmir was immediately sold under the Treaty of Amritsar (1850) to the Dogra Dynasty of Jammu and thereby became a princely state. In 1854, Berar was annexed along with the state of Oudh two years later.[360]\n\n\n\n* ![Warren Hastings, the first governor-general of Fort William (Bengal) who oversaw the company's territories in India.](image)\n\nWarren Hastings, the first governor-general of Fort William (Bengal) who oversaw the company's territories in India.\n* ![Gold coin, minted 1835, with obverse showing the bust of William IV, king of United Kingdom from 26 June 1830 to 20 June 1837, and reverse marked \"Two mohurs\" in English (do ashrafi in Urdu) issued during Company rule in India](image)\n\nGold coin, minted 1835, with obverse showing the bust of William IV, king of United Kingdom from 26 June 1830 to 20 June 1837, and reverse marked \"Two mohurs\" in English (do ashrafi in Urdu) issued during Company rule in India\n* ![Photograph (1855) showing the construction of the Bhor Ghaut incline bridge, Bombay; the incline was conceived by George Clark, the Chief Engineer in the East India Company's Government of Bombay.](image)\n\nPhotograph (1855) showing the construction of the Bhor Ghaut incline bridge, Bombay; the incline was conceived by George Clark, the Chief Engineer in the East India Company's Government of Bombay.\n* ![Watercolor (1863) titled, The Ganges Canal, Roorkee, Saharanpur District (U.P.).

Since the company operated under financial constraints, it had to set up *political* underpinnings for its rule.[361] The most important such support came from the *subsidiary alliances* with Indian princes.[361] In the early 19th century, the territories of these princes accounted for two-thirds of India.[361] When an Indian ruler who was able to secure his territory wanted to enter such an alliance, the company welcomed it as an economical method of indirect rule that did not involve the economic costs of direct administration or the political costs of gaining the support of alien subjects.[362]\n\n\nIn return, the company undertook the \"defense of these subordinate allies and treated them with traditional respect and marks of honor.\"[362] Subsidiary alliances created the Princely States of the Hindu maharajas and the Muslim nawabs. Prominent among the princely states were Cochin (1791), Jaipur (1794), Travancore (1795), Hyderabad (1798), Mysore (1799), Cis-Sutlej Hill States (1815), Central India Agency (1819), Cutch and Gujarat Gaikwad territories (1819), Rajputana (1818) and Bahawalpur (1833).[360]\n\n\n\n#### Indian indenture system[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian indenture system\n\nThe Indian indenture system was an ongoing system of indenture, a form of debt bondage, by which 3.5 million Indians were transported to colonies of European powers to provide labor for the (mainly sugar) plantations. It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of a large Indian diaspora that spread from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean and the growth of large Indo-Caribbean and Indo-African populations.\n\n\n\n## Late modern and contemporary period (after c. 1850 CE)[edit]\n\n\n### Rebellion of 1857 and its consequences[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian Rebellion of 1857\n\n* ![Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during the rebellion.](image)\n\nCharles Canning, the Governor-General of India during the rebellion.\n* ![Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the Doctrine of Lapse.](image)\n\nLord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the Doctrine of Lapse.\n* ![Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi, one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the Doctrine of lapse.](image)\n\nLakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi, one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the Doctrine of lapse.\n* ![Bahadur Shah Zafar the last Mughal Emperor, crowned Emperor of India by the rebels, he was deposed by the British, and died in exile in Burma](image)\n\nBahadur Shah Zafar the last Mughal Emperor, crowned Emperor of India by the rebels, he was deposed by the British, and died in exile in Burma\n\nThe Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the British East India Company in northern and central India against the company's rule. The spark that led to the mutiny was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle, which was insensitive to local religious prohibition. The key mutineer was Mangal Pandey.[363] In addition, the underlying grievances over British taxation, the ethnic gulf between the British officers and their Indian troops and land annexations played a significant role in the rebellion. Within weeks after Pandey's mutiny, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. The rebel soldiers were later joined by Indian nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the Doctrine of Lapse and felt that the company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as Nana Sahib and the Rani of Jhansi belonged to this group.[364]\n\n\nAfter the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels very quickly reached Delhi. The rebels had also captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). Most notably, in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British presence.[365] However, the British East India Company mobilised rapidly with the assistance of friendly Princely states, but it took the British the better part of 1858 to suppress the rebellion. Due to the rebels being poorly equipped and having no outside support or funding, they were brutally subdued.[366]\n\n\nIn the aftermath, all power was transferred from the British East India Company to the British Crown, which began to administer most of India as provinces. The Crown controlled the company's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir). They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947–48.[367]\n\n\n\n### British Raj (1858–1947)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British Raj\n\nBritish Raj\n![](image)\nThe British Indian Empire in 1909. British India is shown in pink; the princely states in yellow.\n![](image)\nA 1903 stereographic image of Victoria Terminus a terminal train station, in Mumbai, completed in 1887, and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nAfter 1857, the colonial government strengthened and expanded its infrastructure via the court system, legal procedures, and statutes. The Indian Penal Code came into being.[368] In education, Thomas Babington Macaulay had made schooling a priority for the Raj in 1835 and succeeded in implementing the use of English for instruction. By 1890 some 60,000 Indians had matriculated.[369] The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, and the population also grew at 1%. However, from 1910s Indian private industry began to grow significantly. India built a modern railway system in the late 19th century which was the fourth largest in the world.[370] Historians have been bitterly divided on issues of economic history, with the Nationalist school arguing that India was poorer due to British rule.[371]\n\n\nIn 1905, Lord Curzon split the large province of Bengal into a largely Hindu western half and \"Eastern Bengal and Assam\", a largely Muslim eastern half. The British goal was said to be efficient administration but the people of Bengal were outraged at the apparent \"divide and rule\" strategy. It also marked the beginning of the organised anti-colonial movement. When the Liberal party in Britain came to power in 1906, he was removed. Bengal was reunified in 1911. The new Viceroy Gilbert Minto and the new Secretary of State for India John Morley consulted with Congress leaders on political reforms. The Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 provided for Indian membership of the provincial executive councils as well as the Viceroy's executive council. The Imperial Legislative Council was enlarged from 25 to 60 members and separate communal representation for Muslims was established in a dramatic step towards representative and responsible government.[372] Several socio-religious organisations came into being at that time. Muslims set up the All India Muslim League in 1906 to protect the interests of the aristocratic Muslims. The Hindu Mahasabha and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) sought to represent Hindu interests though the latter always claimed it to be a \"cultural\" organisation.[373] Sikhs founded the Shiromani Akali Dal in 1920.[374] However, the largest and oldest political party Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, attempted to keep a distance from the socio-religious movements and identity politics.[375]\n\n\n\n* ![Two silver rupee coins issued by the British Raj in 1862 and 1886 respectively, the first in obverse showing a bust of Victoria, Queen, the second of Victoria, Empress.

Historian Nitish Sengupta describes the renaissance as having started with reformer and humanitarian Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1775–1833), and ended with Asia's first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941).[376] This flowering of religious and social reformers, scholars, and writers is described by historian David Kopf as \"one of the most creative periods in Indian history.\"[377]\n\n\nDuring this period, Bengal witnessed an intellectual awakening that is in some way similar to the Renaissance. This movement questioned existing orthodoxies, particularly with respect to women, marriage, the dowry system, the caste system, and religion. One of the earliest social movements that emerged during this time was the Young Bengal movement, which espoused rationalism and atheism as the common denominators of civil conduct among upper caste educated Hindus.[378] It played an important role in reawakening Indian minds and intellect across the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\n\n#### Famines[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Famine in India and Timeline of major famines in India during British rule\n\nSee also: Demographics of India\n\n* ![Map of famines in India 1800–1885](image)\n\nMap of famines in India 1800–1885\n* ![Engraving from The Graphic, October 1877, showing the plight of animals as well as humans in Bellary district, Madras Presidency, British India during the Great Famine of 1876–1878.](image)\n\nEngraving from *The Graphic*, October 1877, showing the plight of animals as well as humans in Bellary district, Madras Presidency, British India during the Great Famine of 1876–1878.\n* ![Government famine relief, Ahmedabad, India, during the Indian famine of 1899–1900.](image)\n\nGovernment famine relief, Ahmedabad, India, during the Indian famine of 1899–1900.\n* ![A picture of orphans who survived the Bengal famine of 1943](image)\n\nA picture of orphans who survived the Bengal famine of 1943\n\nDuring British East India Company and British Crown rule, India experienced some of deadliest ever recorded famines. These famines, usually resulting from crop failures and often exacerbated by policies of the colonial government,[379] included the Great Famine of 1876–1878 in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died,[380] the Great Bengal famine of 1770 where between 1 and 10 million people died,[381][382] the Indian famine of 1899–1900 in which 1.25 to 10 million people died,[379] and the Bengal famine of 1943 where between 2.1 and 3.8 million people died.[383] The Third plague pandemic in the mid-19th century killed 10 million people in India.[384] Despite persistent diseases and famines, the population of the Indian subcontinent, which stood at up to 200 million in 1750,[385] had reached 389 million by 1941.[386]\n\n\n\n#### World War I[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian Army during World War I\n\n* ![Indian Cavalry on the Western front 1914.](image)\n\nIndian Cavalry on the Western front 1914.\n* ![Indian cavalry from the Deccan Horse during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge in 1916.](image)\n\nIndian cavalry from the Deccan Horse during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge in 1916.\n* ![Indian Army gunners (probably 39th Battery) with 3.7-inch mountain howitzers, Jerusalem 1917.](image)\n\nIndian Army gunners (probably 39th Battery) with 3.7-inch mountain howitzers, Jerusalem 1917.\n* ![India Gate is a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in the period 1914–21 in the First World War.](image)\n\nIndia Gate is a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in the period 1914–21 in the First World War.\n\nDuring World War I, over 800,000 volunteered for the army, and more than 400,000 volunteered for non-combat roles, compared with the pre-war annual recruitment of about 15,000 men.[387] The Army saw early action on the Western Front at the First Battle of Ypres. After a year of front-line duty, sickness and casualties had reduced the Indian Corps to the point where it had to be withdrawn. Nearly 700,000 Indians fought the Turks in the Mesopotamian campaign. Indian formations were also sent to East Africa, Egypt, and Gallipoli.[388]\n\n\nIndian Army and Imperial Service Troops fought during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign's defence of the Suez Canal in 1915, at Romani in 1916 and to Jerusalem in 1917. India units occupied the Jordan Valley and after the German spring offensive they became the major force in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during the Battle of Megiddo and in the Desert Mounted Corps' advance to Damascus and on to Aleppo. Other divisions remained in India guarding the North-West Frontier and fulfilling internal security obligations.\n\n\nOne million Indian troops served abroad during the war. In total, 74,187 died,[389] and another 67,000 were wounded.[390] The roughly 90,000 soldiers who died fighting in World War I and the Afghan Wars are commemorated by the India Gate.\n\n\n\n#### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: India in World War II\n\n* ![General Claude Auchinleck (right), Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, with the then Viceroy Wavell (centre) and General Montgomery (left)](image)\n\nGeneral Claude Auchinleck (right), Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, with the then Viceroy Wavell (centre) and General Montgomery (left)\n* ![Indian women training for Air Raid Precautions (ARP) duties in Bombay, 1942](image)\n\nIndian women training for Air Raid Precautions (ARP) duties in Bombay, 1942\n* ![Indian infantrymen of the 7th Rajput Regiment about to go on patrol on the Arakan front in Burma, 1944.](image)\n\nIndian infantrymen of the 7th Rajput Regiment about to go on patrol on the Arakan front in Burma, 1944.\n* ![The stamp series \"Victory\" issued by the Government of British India to commemorate allied victory in World War II.](image)\n\nThe stamp series \"Victory\" issued by the Government of British India to commemorate allied victory in World War II.\n\nBritish India officially declared war on Nazi Germany in September 1939.[391] The British Raj, as part of the Allied Nations, sent over two and a half million volunteer soldiers to fight under British command against the Axis powers. Additionally, several Princely States provided large donations to support the Allied campaign. India also provided the base for American operations in support of China in the China Burma India Theatre.\n\n\nIndians fought with distinction throughout the world, including in the European theatre against Germany, in North Africa against Germany and Italy, against the Italians in East Africa, in the Middle East against the Vichy French, in the South Asian region defending India against the Japanese and fighting the Japanese in Burma. Indians also aided in liberating British colonies such as Singapore and Hong Kong after the Japanese surrender in August 1945. Over 87,000 soldiers from the subcontinent died in World War II.\n\n\nThe Indian National Congress denounced Nazi Germany but would not fight it or anyone else until India was independent. Congress launched the Quit India Movement in August 1942, refusing to co-operate in any way with the government until independence was granted. The government immediately arrested over 60,000 national and local Congress leaders. The Muslim League rejected the Quit India movement and worked closely with the Raj authorities.\n\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose (also called *Netaji*) broke with Congress and tried to form a military alliance with Germany or Japan to gain independence. The Germans assisted Bose in the formation of the Indian Legion;[392] however, it was Japan that helped him revamp the Indian National Army (INA), after the First Indian National Army under Mohan Singh was dissolved. The INA fought under Japanese direction, mostly in Burma.[393] Bose also headed the Provisional Government of Free India (or Azad Hind), a government-in-exile based in Singapore.[394][395]\n\n\nBy 1942, neighbouring Burma was invaded by Japan, which by then had already captured the Indian territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Japan gave nominal control of the islands to the Provisional Government of Free India on 21 October 1943, and in the following March, the Indian National Army with the help of Japan crossed into India and advanced as far as Kohima in Nagaland. This advance on the mainland of the Indian subcontinent reached its farthest point on Indian territory, retreating from the Battle of Kohima in June and from that of Imphal on 3 July 1944.\n\n\nThe region of Bengal in British India suffered a devastating famine during 1940–1943. An estimated 2.1–3 million died from the famine, frequently characterised as \"man-made\",[396] with most sources asserting that wartime colonial policies exacerbated the crisis.[397]\n\n\n\n### Indian independence movement (1885–1947)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian independence movement\n\nSee also: Indian independence activists and Pakistan Movement\n\n* ![The first session of the Indian National Congress in 1885.

However, historians are divided over the causes of its rise. Probable reasons include a \"clash of interests of the Indian people with British interests\",[402] \"racial discriminations\",[403] and \"the revelation of India's past\".[404]\n\n\nThe first step toward Indian self-rule was the appointment of councillors to advise the British viceroy in 1861 and the first Indian was appointed in 1909. Provincial Councils with Indian members were also set up. The councillors' participation was subsequently widened into legislative councils. The British built a large British Indian Army, with the senior officers all British and many of the troops from small minority groups such as Gurkhas from Nepal and Sikhs.[405] The civil service was increasingly filled with natives at the lower levels, with the British holding the more senior positions.[406]\n\n\nBal Gangadhar Tilak, an Indian nationalist leader, declared Swaraj (home rule) as the destiny of the nation. His popular sentence \"Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it\"[407] became the source of inspiration. Tilak was backed by rising public leaders like Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai, who held the same point of view, notably they advocated the Swadeshi movement involving the boycott of imported items and the use of Indian-made goods;[408] the triumvirate were popularly known as Lal Bal Pal. In 1907, the Congress was split into two factions: The radicals, led by Tilak, advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the British Empire and the abandonment of all things British. The moderates, led by leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, on the other hand, wanted reform within the framework of British rule.[408]\n\n\nThe partition of Bengal in 1905 further increased the revolutionary movement for Indian independence. The disenfranchisement lead some to take violent action.\n\n\nThe British themselves adopted a \"carrot and stick\" approach in response to renewed nationalist demands. The means of achieving the proposed measure were later enshrined in the Government of India Act 1919, which introduced the principle of a dual mode of administration, or diarchy, in which elected Indian legislators and appointed British officials shared power.[409] In 1919, Colonel Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to fire their weapons on peaceful protestors, including unarmed women and children, resulting in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre; which led to the Non-cooperation Movement of 1920–1922. The massacre was a decisive episode towards the end of British rule in India.[410]\n\n\nFrom 1920 leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi began highly popular mass movements to campaign against the British Raj using largely peaceful methods. The Gandhi-led independence movement opposed the British rule using non-violent methods like non-co-operation, civil disobedience and economic resistance. However, revolutionary activities against the British rule took place throughout the Indian subcontinent and some others adopted a militant approach like the Hindustan Republican Association, that sought to overthrow British rule by armed struggle.\n\n\nThe All India Azad Muslim Conference gathered in Delhi in April 1940 to voice its support for an independent and united India.[411] Its members included several Islamic organisations in India, as well as 1400 nationalist Muslim delegates.[412][413][414] The pro-separatist All-India Muslim League worked to try to silence those nationalist Muslims who stood against the partition of India, often using \"intimidation and coercion\".[413][414] The murder of the All India Azad Muslim Conference leader Allah Bakhsh Soomro also made it easier for the pro-separatist All-India Muslim League to demand the creation of a Pakistan.[414]\n\n\n\n#### After World War II (c. 1946–1947)[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new; when an age ends; and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n — From, Tryst with destiny, a speech given by Jawaharlal Nehru to the Constituent Assembly of India on the eve of independence, 14 August 1947.[415]\n\nIn January 1946, several mutinies broke out in the armed services, starting with that of RAF servicemen frustrated with their slow repatriation. The mutinies came to a head with mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy in Bombay in February 1946, followed by others in Calcutta, Madras, and Karachi. The mutinies were rapidly suppressed. In early 1946, new elections were called and Congress candidates won in eight of the eleven provinces.\n\n\nLate in 1946, the Labour government decided to end British rule of India, and in early 1947 it announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948 and participating in the formation of an interim government.\n\n\nAlong with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years. Muslim League leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah proclaimed 16 August 1946 as Direct Action Day, with the stated goal of highlighting, peacefully, the demand for a Muslim homeland in British India, which resulted in the outbreak of the cycle of violence that would be later called the \"Great Calcutta Killing of August 1946\". The communal violence spread to Bihar, Noakhali in Bengal, Garhmukteshwar in the United Provinces, and on to Rawalpindi in March 1947 in which Sikhs and Hindus were attacked or driven out by Muslims.\n\n\n\n![](image)Literacy in India grew very slowly until independence in 1947.

In particular, the partition of Punjab and Bengal led to rioting between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in these provinces and spread to other nearby regions, leaving some 500,000 dead. The police and army units were largely ineffective. The British officers were gone, and the units were beginning to tolerate if not actually indulge in violence against their religious enemies.[416][417][418] Also, this period saw one of the largest mass migrations anywhere in modern history, with a total of 12 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly created nations of India and Pakistan (which gained independence on 15 and 14 August 1947 respectively).[417] In 1971, Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan and East Bengal, seceded from Pakistan.[419]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Adivasi\n* *Early Indians*\n* List of Indian periods\n* Economic history of India\n\n\n* Historiography of India\n* History of India (1947–present)\n* Foreign relations of India\n* Indian maritime history\n* Linguistic history of India\n* Military history of India\n* Outline of ancient India\n* Taxation in medieval India\n* *The Cambridge History of India*\n* Timeline of Indian history\n* Traditional games of India\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The \"First urbanisation\" was the Indus Valley Civilisation.[70]\n2. **^** Many historians consider Attock to be the final frontier of the Maratha Empire[338]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Michael D.

In its Delhi session held during April 27–30, 1940 some 1400 delegates took part. They belonged mainly to the lower castes and working class. The famous scholar of Indian Islam, Wilfred Cantwell Smith, feels that the delegates represented a 'majority of India's Muslims'. Among those who attended the conference were representatives of many Islamic theologians and women also took part in the deliberations ... Shamsul Islam argues that the All-India Muslim League at times used intimidation and coercion to silence any opposition among Muslims to its demand for Partition. He calls such tactics of the Muslim League as a 'Reign of Terror'. He gives examples from all over India including the NWFP where the Khudai Khidmatgars remain opposed to the Partition of India.\n414. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Ali, Afsar (17 July 2017). \"Partition of India and Patriotism of Indian Muslims\". *The Milli Gazette*.\n415. **^** \"Great speeches of the 20th century\". *The Guardian*. 8 February 2008.\n416. **^** Philip Ziegler, *Mountbatten*(1985) p. 401.\n417. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Symonds, Richard (1950). *The Making of Pakistan*.

(A former civil servant mentioned in his autobiography that weapon supplies had been sent from NWFP and money was supplied by Delhi-based politicians.)\n419. **^** Srinath Raghavan (2013). *1971*.

Six hundred miles (970 km) of fault ruptured at once and moved up to 60 ft (18 m), releasing about 500 years of stress buildup. Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake-engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles (320 km) southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet (9 m). Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as 8 feet (2.4 m), requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark.\n\n\nIn Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 32 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time. Nearby, a 27-foot (8.2 m) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California.[5] Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan. Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was also reported from Florida and Texas.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 1964, at 5:36 p.m. AKST (March 28, at 3:36 a.m. UTC),[a] a fault between the Pacific and North American plates ruptured near College Fjord in Prince William Sound. The epicenter of the earthquake was 12.4 mi (20.0 km) north of Prince William Sound, 78 miles (126 km) east of Anchorage and 40 miles (64 km) west of Valdez. The focus occurred at a depth of approximately 15.5 mi (24.9 km). Ocean floor shifts created large tsunamis (up to 220 feet (67 m) in height), which resulted in many of the deaths and much of the property damage.[6] Large rockslides were also caused, resulting in great property damage. Vertical displacement of up to 38 feet (12 m) occurred, affecting an area of 100,000 square miles (260,000 km2) within Alaska.\n\n\nStudies of ground motion have led to a peak ground acceleration estimate of 0.14–0.18 *g*.[7]\n\n\nThe Alaska earthquake was a subduction zone (megathrust) earthquake, caused by an oceanic plate sinking under a continental plate. The fault responsible was the Aleutian Megathrust, a reverse fault caused by a compressional force. This caused much of the uneven ground which is the result of ground shifted to the opposite elevation.[8]\n\n\n\n## Tsunami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Calculated travel time map for the tectonic tsunami produced by the 1964 Prince William Sound earthquake in Alaska. Tsunami Travel Times computed using Tsunami Travel Times[9] software v3.1 (P. Wessel). The map does not show the height or strength of the waves, only the calculated travel times.  \n   \n * Red: 1- to 4-hour arrival times\n* Yellow: 5- to 6-hour arrival times\n* Green: 7- to 14-hour arrival times\n* Blue: 15- to 21-hour arrival times.\n\nTwo types of tsunami were produced by this subduction zone earthquake. There was a tectonic tsunami produced in addition to about 20 smaller and local tsunamis. These smaller tsunamis were produced by submarine and subaerial landslides and were responsible for the majority of the tsunami damage. Tsunami waves were noted in over 20 countries, including Peru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan, Mexico, and in the continent of Antarctica. The largest tsunami wave was recorded in Shoup Bay, Alaska, with a height of about 220 ft (67 m).[4][10]\n\n\n\n## Death toll, damage, and casualties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The largest landslide in Anchorage occurred along Knik Arm between Point Woronzof and Fish Creek, causing substantial damage to numerous homes in the Turnagain-By-The-Sea subdivision.\n![](image)The ruin of Portage\n![](image)A plank driven through a tire by the tsunami in Whittier\n![](image)The 5-story JCPenney department store in Anchorage in 1964, following the earthquake.\nAs a result of the earthquake, 131 people are believed to have died:[4] Nine died as a result of the earthquake itself and another 122 died from the subsequent tsunamis all over the world.[11] Five died from the tsunami in Oregon,[12] and 12 died from the tsunami in Crescent City, California.[13][14]\n\n\nThe quake was a reported XI on the modified Mercalli Intensity scale \"indicating major structural damage, and ground fissures and failures\".[15] Property damage was estimated at $116 million[4] ($0.87 billion in 2023 dollars).[16]\n\n\n\nUnited States Geological Survey video explaining the earthquake and footage\n### Anchorage area[edit]\n\n\nMost damage occurred in Anchorage, 75 mi (121 km) northwest of the epicenter. Anchorage was not hit by tsunamis, but downtown Anchorage was heavily damaged, and parts of the city built on sandy bluffs overlying \"Bootlegger Cove clay\" near Cook Inlet, most notably the Turnagain neighborhood, suffered landslide damage. The neighborhood lost 75 houses in the landslide, and the destroyed area has since been turned into Earthquake Park.[17] The Government Hill school suffered from the Government Hill landslide, leaving it in two jagged, broken pieces. Land overlooking the Ship Creek valley near the Alaska Railroad yards also slid, destroying many acres of buildings and city blocks in downtown Anchorage. Most other areas of the city were only moderately damaged. The 60-foot (18 m) concrete control tower at Anchorage International Airport was not engineered to withstand earthquake activity and collapsed, killing William George Taylor, the Federal Aviation Agency air traffic controller on duty in the tower cab at the time the earthquake began.[18]\n\n\nOne house on W. 10th Avenue suffered peripheral damage, but only one block away the recently completed (and still unoccupied) Four Seasons Building on Ninth Avenue collapsed completely, with the concrete elevator shafts sticking up out of the rubble like a seesaw.\n\n\nThe hamlets of Girdwood and Portage, located 30 and 40 mi (48 and 64 km) southeast of central Anchorage on the Turnagain Arm, were destroyed by subsidence and subsequent tidal action. Girdwood was relocated inland and Portage was abandoned. About 20 miles (32 km) of the Seward Highway sank below the high-water mark of Turnagain Arm; the highway and its bridges were raised and rebuilt in 1964–66.\n\n\n\n### Elsewhere in Alaska[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kodiak before and after the earthquake\n![](image)The Valdez townsite was abandoned and relocated following the 1964 earthquake and was used as a pipe yard for the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, as shown in this 1974 photo\nMost coastal towns in the Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, and Kodiak Island areas, especially the major ports of Seward, Whittier and Kodiak were heavily damaged by a combination of seismic activity, subsidence, post-quake tsunamis and/or earthquake-caused fires. Valdez with 32 dead was not totally destroyed, but after three years, the town relocated to higher ground four miles (6.4 km) west of its original site. Some Alaska Native villages, including Chenega and Afognak, were destroyed or damaged. The earthquake caused the ballistic missile detection radar of Clear Air Force Station to go offline for six minutes, the only unscheduled interruption in its operational history. Near Cordova, the Million Dollar Bridge crossing the Copper River also suffered damage, with Span #4 slipping off its pylon and collapsing. The community of Girdwood was also confined to the southern side of the Seward Highway when water rushed into Turnagain Arm and flooded or destroyed any buildings left standing to the north of the highway. Only the ground immediately along the highway and that on the north side of the road dropped, prompting geologists to speculate that Girdwood may rest upon an ancient cliff face covered by thousands of years of sediment and glacial deposits.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nA 4.5 ft (1.4 m) wave reached Prince Rupert, British Columbia, just south of the Alaska Panhandle, about three hours after the earthquake. The tsunami then reached Tofino, on the exposed west coast of Vancouver Island, and traveled up a fjord to hit Port Alberni twice, washing away 55 homes and damaging 375 others. The towns of Hot Springs Cove, Zeballos, and Amai also saw damage.[19] The damage in British Columbia was estimated at CA$10 million ($96 million in 2023 Canadian dollars or $91 million in 2023 US dollars).[20][21][22]\n\n\n\n### Elsewhere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A winter scene of a \"ghost forest\" that was killed and preserved by salt water along with ruined buildings at the site of the former town of Portage, 2011\nTwelve people were killed by the tsunami in or near Crescent City, California, while four children were killed on the Oregon coast at Beverly Beach State Park.[23] Other coastal towns in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Hawaii were damaged. Minor damage to boats occurred as far south as Los Angeles.[24] Effects of the earthquake were even noted as far east as Freeport, Texas, where tide gauges recorded waves similar to seismic surface waves.[25] Seiches were detected in wells in countries around the world, including England, Namibia, and Australia.[26]\n\n\n\n## Aftershocks[edit]\n\n\nThere were hundreds of aftershocks in the first weeks following the main shock. In the first day alone, eleven major aftershocks were recorded with a magnitude greater than 6.0. Nine more struck over the next three weeks. In all, thousands of aftershocks occurred in the months following the quake, and smaller aftershocks continued to strike the region for more than a year.[24]\n\n\n\n## Recovery efforts[edit]\n\n\nAlaska had never experienced a major disaster in a highly populated area before, and had very limited resources for dealing with the effects of such an event. In Anchorage, at the urging of geologist Lidia Selkregg, the City of Anchorage and the Alaska State Housing Authority appointed a team of 40 scientists, including geologists, soil scientists, and engineers, to assess the damage done by the earthquake to the city.[27] The team, called the Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group, was headed by Dr. Ruth A. M. Schmidt, a geology professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The team of scientists came into conflict with local developers and downtown business owners who wanted to immediately rebuild; the scientists wanted to identify future dangers to ensure that rebuilt infrastructure would be safe.[28] The team produced a report on May 8, 1964, just a little more than a month after the earthquake.[27][29]\n\n\nThe United States military, which has a large active presence in Alaska, also stepped in to assist within moments of the end of the quake. The U.S. Army rapidly re-established communications with the lower 48 states, deployed troops to assist the citizens of Anchorage, and dispatched a convoy to Valdez.[30] On the advice of military and civilian leaders, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared all of Alaska a major disaster area the day after the quake. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard deployed ships to isolated coastal communities to assist with immediate needs. Bad weather and poor visibility hampered air rescue and observation efforts the day after the quake, but on Sunday the 29th the situation improved and rescue helicopters and observation aircraft were deployed.[30] A military airlift immediately began shipping relief supplies to Alaska, eventually delivering 2,570,000 pounds (1,170,000 kg) of food and other supplies.[31] Broadcast journalist Genie Chance assisted in recovery and relief efforts, staying on the KENI air waves over Anchorage for more than 24 continuous hours as the voice of calm from her temporary post within the Anchorage Public Safety Building.[32] She was effectively designated as the public safety officer by the city's police chief.[32] Chance provided breaking news of the catastrophic events that continued to develop following the magnitude 9.2 earthquake, and she served as the voice of the public safety office, coordinating response efforts, connecting available resources to needs around the community, disseminating information about shelters and prepared food rations, passing messages of well-being between loved ones, and helping to reunite families.[33]\n\n\nIn the longer term, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led the effort to rebuild roads, clear debris, and establish new townsites for communities that had been completely destroyed, at a cost of $110 million.[31] The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center was formed as a direct response to the disaster. Federal disaster relief funds paid for reconstruction as well as financially supporting the devastated infrastructure of Alaska's government, spending hundreds of millions of dollars that helped keep Alaska financially solvent until the discovery of massive oil deposits at Prudhoe Bay. At the order of the U.S. Defense Department, the Alaska National Guard founded the Alaska Division of Emergency Services to respond to any future disasters.[30]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)1960s portal\n* ![flag](image)Alaska portal\n\n\n* 2018 Anchorage earthquake\n* 1965 Rat Islands earthquake\n* List of megathrust earthquakes\n* List of earthquakes in 1964\n* List of earthquakes in Alaska\n* List of earthquakes in the United States\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** At the time of the disaster, Alaska was divided between four separate time zones, Anchorage was five hours behind Eastern Standard Time.

Run-up of 67 m (220 ft) at Shoup Bay, Alaska. |\n| Casualties | 131 killed |\n\n\nThe **1964 Alaskan earthquake**, also known as the **Great Alaskan earthquake** and **Good Friday earthquake**, occurred at 5:36 pm AKST on Good Friday, March 27.[3] Across south-central Alaska, ground fissures, collapsing structures, and tsunamis resulting from the earthquake caused about 131 deaths.[4]\n\n\nLasting four minutes and thirty-eight seconds, the magnitude 9.2 megathrust earthquake remains the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in North America, and the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900. Six hundred miles (970 km) of fault ruptured at once and moved up to 60 ft (18 m), releasing about 500 years of stress buildup. Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake-engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles (320 km) southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet (9 m). Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as 8 feet (2.4 m), requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark.\n\n\nIn Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 32 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time. Nearby, a 27-foot (8.2 m) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California.[5] Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan. Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was also reported from Florida and Texas.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 1964, at 5:36 p.m. AKST (March 28, at 3:36 a.m. UTC),[a] a fault between the Pacific and North American plates ruptured near College Fjord in Prince William Sound. The epicenter of the earthquake was 12.4 mi (20.0 km) north of Prince William Sound, 78 miles (126 km) east of Anchorage and 40 miles (64 km) west of Valdez. The focus occurred at a depth of approximately 15.5 mi (24.9 km). Ocean floor shifts created large tsunamis (up to 220 feet (67 m) in height), which resulted in many of the deaths and much of the property damage.[6] Large rockslides were also caused, resulting in great property damage. Vertical displacement of up to 38 feet (12 m) occurred, affecting an area of 100,000 square miles (260,000 km2) within Alaska.\n\n\nStudies of ground motion have led to a peak ground acceleration estimate of 0.14–0.18 *g*.[7]\n\n\nThe Alaska earthquake was a subduction zone (megathrust) earthquake, caused by an oceanic plate sinking under a continental plate. The fault responsible was the Aleutian Megathrust, a reverse fault caused by a compressional force. This caused much of the uneven ground which is the result of ground shifted to the opposite elevation.[8]\n\n\n\n## Tsunami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Calculated travel time map for the tectonic tsunami produced by the 1964 Prince William Sound earthquake in Alaska. Tsunami Travel Times computed using Tsunami Travel Times[9] software v3.1 (P. Wessel). The map does not show the height or strength of the waves, only the calculated travel times.  \n   \n * Red: 1- to 4-hour arrival times\n* Yellow: 5- to 6-hour arrival times\n* Green: 7- to 14-hour arrival times\n* Blue: 15- to 21-hour arrival times.\n\nTwo types of tsunami were produced by this subduction zone earthquake. There was a tectonic tsunami produced in addition to about 20 smaller and local tsunamis. These smaller tsunamis were produced by submarine and subaerial landslides and were responsible for the majority of the tsunami damage. Tsunami waves were noted in over 20 countries, including Peru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan, Mexico, and in the continent of Antarctica. The largest tsunami wave was recorded in Shoup Bay, Alaska, with a height of about 220 ft (67 m).[4][10]\n\n\n\n## Death toll, damage, and casualties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The largest landslide in Anchorage occurred along Knik Arm between Point Woronzof and Fish Creek, causing substantial damage to numerous homes in the Turnagain-By-The-Sea subdivision.\n![](image)The ruin of Portage\n![](image)A plank driven through a tire by the tsunami in Whittier\n![](image)The 5-story JCPenney department store in Anchorage in 1964, following the earthquake.\nAs a result of the earthquake, 131 people are believed to have died:[4] Nine died as a result of the earthquake itself and another 122 died from the subsequent tsunamis all over the world.[11] Five died from the tsunami in Oregon,[12] and 12 died from the tsunami in Crescent City, California.[13][14]\n\n\nThe quake was a reported XI on the modified Mercalli Intensity scale \"indicating major structural damage, and ground fissures and failures\".[15] Property damage was estimated at $116 million[4] ($0.87 billion in 2023 dollars).[16]\n\n\n\nUnited States Geological Survey video explaining the earthquake and footage\n### Anchorage area[edit]\n\n\nMost damage occurred in Anchorage, 75 mi (121 km) northwest of the epicenter. Anchorage was not hit by tsunamis, but downtown Anchorage was heavily damaged, and parts of the city built on sandy bluffs overlying \"Bootlegger Cove clay\" near Cook Inlet, most notably the Turnagain neighborhood, suffered landslide damage. The neighborhood lost 75 houses in the landslide, and the destroyed area has since been turned into Earthquake Park.[17] The Government Hill school suffered from the Government Hill landslide, leaving it in two jagged, broken pieces. Land overlooking the Ship Creek valley near the Alaska Railroad yards also slid, destroying many acres of buildings and city blocks in downtown Anchorage. Most other areas of the city were only moderately damaged. The 60-foot (18 m) concrete control tower at Anchorage International Airport was not engineered to withstand earthquake activity and collapsed, killing William George Taylor, the Federal Aviation Agency air traffic controller on duty in the tower cab at the time the earthquake began.[18]\n\n\nOne house on W. 10th Avenue suffered peripheral damage, but only one block away the recently completed (and still unoccupied) Four Seasons Building on Ninth Avenue collapsed completely, with the concrete elevator shafts sticking up out of the rubble like a seesaw.\n\n\nThe hamlets of Girdwood and Portage, located 30 and 40 mi (48 and 64 km) southeast of central Anchorage on the Turnagain Arm, were destroyed by subsidence and subsequent tidal action. Girdwood was relocated inland and Portage was abandoned. About 20 miles (32 km) of the Seward Highway sank below the high-water mark of Turnagain Arm; the highway and its bridges were raised and rebuilt in 1964–66.\n\n\n\n### Elsewhere in Alaska[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kodiak before and after the earthquake\n![](image)The Valdez townsite was abandoned and relocated following the 1964 earthquake and was used as a pipe yard for the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, as shown in this 1974 photo\nMost coastal towns in the Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, and Kodiak Island areas, especially the major ports of Seward, Whittier and Kodiak were heavily damaged by a combination of seismic activity, subsidence, post-quake tsunamis and/or earthquake-caused fires. Valdez with 32 dead was not totally destroyed, but after three years, the town relocated to higher ground four miles (6.4 km) west of its original site. Some Alaska Native villages, including Chenega and Afognak, were destroyed or damaged. The earthquake caused the ballistic missile detection radar of Clear Air Force Station to go offline for six minutes, the only unscheduled interruption in its operational history. Near Cordova, the Million Dollar Bridge crossing the Copper River also suffered damage, with Span #4 slipping off its pylon and collapsing. The community of Girdwood was also confined to the southern side of the Seward Highway when water rushed into Turnagain Arm and flooded or destroyed any buildings left standing to the north of the highway. Only the ground immediately along the highway and that on the north side of the road dropped, prompting geologists to speculate that Girdwood may rest upon an ancient cliff face covered by thousands of years of sediment and glacial deposits.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nA 4.5 ft (1.4 m) wave reached Prince Rupert, British Columbia, just south of the Alaska Panhandle, about three hours after the earthquake. The tsunami then reached Tofino, on the exposed west coast of Vancouver Island, and traveled up a fjord to hit Port Alberni twice, washing away 55 homes and damaging 375 others. The towns of Hot Springs Cove, Zeballos, and Amai also saw damage.[19] The damage in British Columbia was estimated at CA$10 million ($96 million in 2023 Canadian dollars or $91 million in 2023 US dollars).[20][21][22]\n\n\n\n### Elsewhere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A winter scene of a \"ghost forest\" that was killed and preserved by salt water along with ruined buildings at the site of the former town of Portage, 2011\nTwelve people were killed by the tsunami in or near Crescent City, California, while four children were killed on the Oregon coast at Beverly Beach State Park.[23] Other coastal towns in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Hawaii were damaged. Minor damage to boats occurred as far south as Los Angeles.[24] Effects of the earthquake were even noted as far east as Freeport, Texas, where tide gauges recorded waves similar to seismic surface waves.[25] Seiches were detected in wells in countries around the world, including England, Namibia, and Australia.[26]\n\n\n\n## Aftershocks[edit]\n\n\nThere were hundreds of aftershocks in the first weeks following the main shock. In the first day alone, eleven major aftershocks were recorded with a magnitude greater than 6.0. Nine more struck over the next three weeks. In all, thousands of aftershocks occurred in the months following the quake, and smaller aftershocks continued to strike the region for more than a year.[24]\n\n\n\n## Recovery efforts[edit]\n\n\nAlaska had never experienced a major disaster in a highly populated area before, and had very limited resources for dealing with the effects of such an event. In Anchorage, at the urging of geologist Lidia Selkregg, the City of Anchorage and the Alaska State Housing Authority appointed a team of 40 scientists, including geologists, soil scientists, and engineers, to assess the damage done by the earthquake to the city.[27] The team, called the Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group, was headed by Dr. Ruth A. M. Schmidt, a geology professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The team of scientists came into conflict with local developers and downtown business owners who wanted to immediately rebuild; the scientists wanted to identify future dangers to ensure that rebuilt infrastructure would be safe.[28] The team produced a report on May 8, 1964, just a little more than a month after the earthquake.[27][29]\n\n\nThe United States military, which has a large active presence in Alaska, also stepped in to assist within moments of the end of the quake. The U.S. Army rapidly re-established communications with the lower 48 states, deployed troops to assist the citizens of Anchorage, and dispatched a convoy to Valdez.[30] On the advice of military and civilian leaders, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared all of Alaska a major disaster area the day after the quake. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard deployed ships to isolated coastal communities to assist with immediate needs. Bad weather and poor visibility hampered air rescue and observation efforts the day after the quake, but on Sunday the 29th the situation improved and rescue helicopters and observation aircraft were deployed.[30] A military airlift immediately began shipping relief supplies to Alaska, eventually delivering 2,570,000 pounds (1,170,000 kg) of food and other supplies.[31] Broadcast journalist Genie Chance assisted in recovery and relief efforts, staying on the KENI air waves over Anchorage for more than 24 continuous hours as the voice of calm from her temporary post within the Anchorage Public Safety Building.[32] She was effectively designated as the public safety officer by the city's police chief.[32] Chance provided breaking news of the catastrophic events that continued to develop following the magnitude 9.2 earthquake, and she served as the voice of the public safety office, coordinating response efforts, connecting available resources to needs around the community, disseminating information about shelters and prepared food rations, passing messages of well-being between loved ones, and helping to reunite families.[33]\n\n\nIn the longer term, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led the effort to rebuild roads, clear debris, and establish new townsites for communities that had been completely destroyed, at a cost of $110 million.[31] The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center was formed as a direct response to the disaster. Federal disaster relief funds paid for reconstruction as well as financially supporting the devastated infrastructure of Alaska's government, spending hundreds of millions of dollars that helped keep Alaska financially solvent until the discovery of massive oil deposits at Prudhoe Bay. At the order of the U.S. Defense Department, the Alaska National Guard founded the Alaska Division of Emergency Services to respond to any future disasters.[30]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)1960s portal\n* ![flag](image)Alaska portal\n\n\n* 2018 Anchorage earthquake\n* 1965 Rat Islands earthquake\n* List of megathrust earthquakes\n* List of earthquakes in 1964\n* List of earthquakes in Alaska\n* List of earthquakes in the United States\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** At the time of the disaster, Alaska was divided between four separate time zones, Anchorage was five hours behind Eastern Standard Time.

Indonesia is an archipelagic country of 16,000 to 17,000 islands (16,056 named and around 6,000 are inhabited) stretching along the equator in Southeast Asia.[1][2] The country's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade; trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history. The area of Indonesia is populated by peoples of various migrations, creating a diversity of cultures, ethnicities, and languages. The archipelago's landforms and climate significantly influenced agriculture and trade, and the formation of states. The boundaries of the state of Indonesia match the 20th-century borders of the Dutch East Indies.\n\n\nFossilised remains of *Homo erectus*, popularly known as \"Java Man\", and their tools suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited at least 1.5 million years ago. Austronesian people, who form the majority of the modern population, are thought to have originally been from Taiwan and arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE. From the 7th century CE, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished, bringing Hindu and Buddhist influences with it. The agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties subsequently thrived in inland Java. The last significant non-Muslim kingdom, the Hindu Majapahit kingdom, flourished from the late 13th century, and its influence stretched over much of Indonesia. The earliest evidence of Islamised populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra; other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam, which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century.[3] For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences.\n\n\nEuropeans such as the Portuguese arrived in Indonesia from the 16th century seeking to monopolise the sources of valuable nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in Maluku. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (*Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie* or VOC) and became the dominant European power by 1610. Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies under government control. By the early 20th century, Dutch dominance extended to the current boundaries. The Japanese invasion and occupation in 1942–1945 during WWII ended Dutch rule, and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, nationalist leader Sukarno declared independence and became president. The Netherlands tried to reestablish its rule, but a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence.\n\n\nAn attempted coup in 1965 led to a violent army-led anti-communist purge in which over half a million people were killed. General Suharto politically outmanoeuvred President Sukarno, and became president in March 1968. His New Order administration garnered the favour of the West, whose investment in Indonesia was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth. In the late 1990s, however, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis, which led to popular protests and Suharto's resignation on 21 May 1998. The *Reformasi* era following Suharto's resignation has led to a strengthening of democratic processes, including a regional autonomy program, the secession of East Timor, and the first direct presidential election in 2004. Political instability, social unrest, corruption, natural disasters, and terrorism remained problems in the 2000s, but the economy has performed strongly since 2007. Although relations between different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas.\n\n\nToday, Indonesia is a diverse and multicultural nation with a population of over 270 million people. The country is known for its natural beauty, rich cultural heritage, and significant contributions to global art, music, and cuisine. It is also one of the world's fastest-growing economies and a major player in the Southeast Asian region.\n\n\n\n\n## Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Indonesia\n\n![](image)\nThe replica of Java man skull, originally discovered in Sangiran, Central Java\n![](image)\nThe syntype fossils of Java Man (*H. e. erectus*), at Naturalis, Leiden\n\nIn 2007, an analysis of cut marks on two bovid bones found in Sangiran, showed them to have been made 1.5 to 1.6 million years ago by clamshell tools. This is the oldest evidence for the presence of early humans in Indonesia. Fossilised remains of *Homo erectus* in Indonesia, popularly known as the \"Java Man\" were first discovered by the Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois at Trinil in 1891, and are at least 700,000 years old. Other *H. erectus* fossils of a similar age were found at Sangiran in the 1930s by the anthropologist Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald, who in the same time period also uncovered fossils at Ngandong alongside more advanced tools, re-dated in 2011 to between 550,000 and 143,000 years old.[4][5][6][7] In 1977 another *H. erectus* skull was discovered at Sambungmacan.[8] In 2010, stone tools were discovered on Flores, dating from 1 million years ago. These are the earliest remains implying human seafaring technology.[9] The earliest evidence of artistic activity ever found, in the form of diagonal etchings made with the use of a shark's tooth, was detected in 2014 on a 500,000-year-old fossil of a clam found in Java in the 1890s, associated with *H. erectus*.[10]\n\n\nIn 2003, on the island of Flores, fossils of a 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall hominid dated between 74,000 and 13,000 years old were discovered, much to the surprise of the scientific community. This newly discovered hominid was named the \"Flores Man\", or *Homo floresiensis*.[11][12] A phylogenetic analysis published in 2017 suggests that *H. floresiensis* was descended from the same ancestor as *Homo habilis.*[13] *H. floresiensis* would thus represent a previously unknown and very early migration out of Africa. The *Homo floresiensis* skeletal material is dated from 60,000 to 100,000 years ago; stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains were from archaeological horizons ranging from 50,000 to 190,000 years ago.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Megalithic statue found in Tegurwangi, Sumatra, Indonesia, 1500 CE\nThe Indonesian archipelago was formed during the thaw after the Last Glacial Maximum. Early humans travelled by sea and spread from mainland Asia eastward to New Guinea and Australia. *Homo sapiens* reached the region by around 45,000 years ago.[15] In 2011, evidence was uncovered in neighbouring East Timor, showing that 42,000 years ago, these early settlers had high-level maritime skills, and by implication the technology needed to make ocean crossings to reach Australia and other islands, as they were catching and consuming large numbers of big deep sea fish such as tuna.[16]\n\n\nAn elaborate 4.5 m long rock art panel in a limestone cave at Leang Bulu' in Sulawesi is currently considered the earliest figurative artwork in the world.[17] It portrays several figures hunting wild pigs and dwarf bovids. This rock art was dated to at least 43.9 ka on the basis of uranium-series analysis of overlying speleothems. A painted hand stencil from Leang Timpuseng, which has a minimum age of 39.9 kyr, is now the oldest known hand stencil in the world.[18]\n\n\nAustronesian people form the majority of the modern population. They may have arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE and are thought to have originated in Taiwan.[19] During this period, parts of Indonesia participated in the Maritime Jade Road, whith outlets in Kalimantan which existed for 3,000 years between 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.[20][21][22][23] Dong Son culture spread to Indonesia bringing with it techniques of wet-field rice cultivation, ritual buffalo sacrifice, bronze casting, megalithic practises, and ikat weaving methods. Some of these practices remain in areas including the Batak areas of Sumatra, Toraja in Sulawesi, and several islands in Nusa Tenggara. Early Indonesians were animists who honoured the spirits of the dead believing their souls or life force could still help the living.\n\n\n\n![](image)Example of Rice Terraces in Indonesia\nIdeal agricultural conditions, and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the 8th century BCE,[24] allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century CE. These kingdoms (little more than collections of villages subservient to petty chieftains) evolved with their own ethnic and tribal religions. Java's hot and even temperature, abundant rain and volcanic soil, was perfect for wet rice cultivation. Such agriculture required a well-organized society, in contrast to the society based on dry-field rice, which is a much simpler form of cultivation that does not require an elaborate social structure to support it.\n\n\nBuni culture clay pottery flourished in coastal northern West Java and Banten around 400 BCE to 100 CE.[25] The Buni culture was probably the predecessor of the Tarumanagara kingdom, one of the earliest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia, producing numerous inscriptions and marking the beginning of the historical period in Java.\n\n\nOn 11 December 2019, a team of researchers led by Dr. Maxime Aubert announced the discovery of the oldest hunting scenes in prehistoric art in the world which is more than 44,000 years old from the limestone cave of Leang Bulu' Sipong 4. Archaeologists determined the age of the depiction of hunting a pig and buffalo thanks to the calcite 'popcorn', different isotope levels of radioactive uranium and thorium.[26][27][28]\n\n\n\n## Hindu-Buddhist civilizations[edit]\n\n\n### Early kingdom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1600-year-old stone inscription from the era of Purnawarman, king of Tarumanagara, founded in Tugu sub-district of Jakarta\nIndonesia like much of Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture.[29] From the 2nd century, through the Indian dynasties like the Pallava, Gupta, Pala and Chola in the succeeding centuries up to the 12th century, Indian culture spread across all of Southeast Asia.[29]\n\n\nReferences to the Dvipantara or Yawadvipa, a Hindu kingdom in Java and Sumatra appear in Sanskrit writings from 200 BCE. In India's earliest epic, the Ramayana, Sugriva, the chief of Rama's army dispatched his men to Yawadvipa, the island of Java, in search of Sita.[30] According to the ancient Tamil text Manimekalai Java had a kingdom with a capital called Nagapuram.[31][32][33] The earliest archaeological relic discovered in Indonesia is from the Ujung Kulon National Park, West Java, where an early Hindu statue of Ganesha estimated from the 1st century CE was found on the summit of Mount Raksa in Panaitan island. There is also archaeological evidence of Sunda Kingdom in West Java dating from the 2nd-century, and Jiwa Temple in Batujaya, Karawang, West Java was probably built around this time. South Indian culture was spread to Southeast Asia by the south Indian Pallava dynasty in the 4th and 5th centuries.[34] and by the 5th century, stone inscriptions written in Pallava scripts were found in Java and Borneo.\n\n\nA number of Hindu and Buddhist states flourished and then declined across Indonesia. Seven rough plinths dating from the beginning of the 4th century CE were found in Kutai, East Kalimantan, near the Mahakam River known as the Yupa inscription or \"Mulavarman Inscription\" believed to be one of the earliest Sanskrit inscriptions of Indonesia, the plinths were written by Brahmins in the Sanskrit language using the Pallava script of India recalling of a generous king by the name of Mulavarman who donated a huge amount of alms to Brahmin priests in his kingdom, the kingdom was known as the Kutai Martadipura Kingdom located in present East Kalimantan Province, believed to be the oldest and first Hindu kingdom of Indonesia.[35]\n\n\n\n* ![Indonesian burial mask, earlier than 5th century CE.](image)\n\nIndonesian burial mask, earlier than 5th century CE.\n* ![Standing warrior (spearman) bronze figure, Java, circa 500 BC–300 AD](image)\n\nStanding warrior (spearman) bronze figure, Java, circa 500 BC–300 AD\n* ![Standing warrior (swordsman) bronze figure, Java, circa 500 BC–300 AD.](image)\n\nStanding warrior (swordsman) bronze figure, Java, circa 500 BC–300 AD.\n\n\n### Tarumanagara and Sunda[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tarumanagara Kingdom and Sunda Kingdom\n\nOne such early kingdom was Tarumanagara, which flourished between 358 and 669 CE. Located in West Java close to modern-day Jakarta, its 5th-century king, Purnawarman, established the earliest known inscriptions in Java, the Ciaruteun inscription located near Bogor. And other inscriptions called the Pasir Awi inscription and the Muncul inscription. On this monument, King Purnawarman inscribed his name and made an imprint of his footprints, as well as his elephant's footprints. The accompanying inscription reads, \"Here are the footprints of King Purnavarman, the heroic conqueror of the world\". This inscription is written in Pallava script and in Sanskrit and is still clear after 1500 years. Purnawarman apparently built a canal that changed the course of the Cakung River, and drained a coastal area for agriculture and settlement purpose. In his stone inscriptions, Purnawarman associated himself with Vishnu, and Brahmins ritually secured the hydraulic project.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)8th century Borobudur Buddhist monument, Sailendra dynasty, is the largest Buddhist temple in the world.\nAround the same period, in the 6th to 7th centuries (501–700 CE), the Kalingga Kingdom was established in Central Java northern coast, mentioned in Chinese account.[37] The name of this kingdom was derived from ancient Indian kingdom of Kalinga, which suggest the ancient link between India and Indonesia.\n\n\nThe political history of Indonesian archipelago during the 7th to 11th (601–1100 CE) around centuries was dominated by Srivijaya based in Sumatra and Sailendra that dominated southeast Asia based in Java and constructed Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument in the world. The history prior of the 14th and 15th centuries (1301–1500 CE) is not well known due to the scarcity of evidence. By the 15th century (1401–1500 CE), two major states dominated this period; Majapahit in East Java, the greatest of the pre-Islamic Indonesian states, and Malacca on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, arguably one of the greatest of the Muslim trading empires,[38] this marked the rise of Muslim states in the Indonesian archipelago.\n\n\n\n### Mataram[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mataram Kingdom\n\n![](image)Prambanan in Java was built during the Sanjaya dynasty of Mataram Kingdom; it is one of the largest Hindu temple complexes in Southeast Asia.\nMataram Empire, sometimes referred to as Mataram Kingdom,[39] was an Indianized kingdom based in Central Java around modern-day Yogyakarta between the 8th and 10th centuries. The kingdom was ruled by the Sailendra dynasty, and later by the Sanjaya dynasty. The centre of the kingdom was moved from central Java to East Java by Mpu Sindok. An eruption of the volcano Mount Merapi in 929, and political pressure from Sailendrans based in the Srivijaya Empire may have caused the move.\n\n\nThe first king of Mataram, Sri Sanjaya, left inscriptions in stone.[40] The monumental Hindu temple of Prambanan in the vicinity of Yogyakarta was built by Pikatan. Dharmawangsa ordered the translation of the Mahabharata into Old Javanese in 996.\n\n\nIn the period 750 CE – 850 CE, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture. A rapid increase in temple construction occurred across the landscape of its heartland in Mataram (Kedu and Kewu Plain). The most notable temples constructed in Mataram are Kalasan, Sewu, Borobudur and Prambanan. The Empire had become the supreme power not only in Java but also over Srivijayan Empire, Bali, southern Thailand, some Philippine kingdoms, and Khmer in Cambodia.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sewu temple in Special Region of Yogyakarta\nLater in its history, the dynasty divided into two dynasties based on their own religion, the Buddhist and Shivaist dynasties. Civil war was unavoidable and the outcome was Mataram Empire divided into two powerful kingdom based on region and religion. The Shivaist dynasty of Mataram kingdom in Java led by Rakai Pikatan and the Buddhist dynasty of Srivijaya kingdom in Sumatra led by Balaputradewa. The hostility between them didn't end until in 1006 when the Sailendran based in Srivijaya kingdom incited rebellion by Wurawari, vassal of Mataram kingdom and sacked Shivaist dynasty's capital in Watugaluh, Java. Srivijaya kingdom rose into undisputed hegemonic Empire in the era as the result. Yet the Shivaist dynasty survived and successfully reclaimed the east Java in 1019 then descended to Kahuripan kingdom led by Airlangga son of Udayana of Bali.[42]\n\n\n\n### Sriwijaya[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Srivijaya\n\nSriwijaya was a kingdom on Sumatra which influenced much of the Maritime Southeast Asia. From the 7th century, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it.[43][44]\n\n\nSrivijaya was centred in the coastal trading centre of present-day Palembang. Srivijaya was not a \"state\" in the modern sense with defined boundaries and a centralised government to which the citizens own allegiance.[45] Rather Srivijaya was a confederacy form of society centred on a royal heartland.[45] It was a thalassocracy and did not extend its influence far beyond the coastal areas of the islands of Southeast Asia. Trade was the driving force of Srivijaya just as it is for most societies throughout history.[46] The Srivijayan navy controlled the trade that made its way through the Strait of Malacca.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe territory of the Srivijaya empire. Historically, Srivijaya was one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia.\n![](image)\nThe depiction of Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa, the first king of Srivijaya\n\nBy the 7th century, the harbours of various vassal states of Srivijaya lined both coasts of the Straits of Melaka.[46] Around this time, Srivijaya had established suzerainty over large areas of Sumatra, western Java, and much of the Malay Peninsula.[47] Dominating the Malacca and Sunda straits, the empire controlled both the Spice Route traffic and local trade.[47] It remained a formidable sea power until the 13th century.[47] This spread the ethnic Malay culture throughout Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and western Borneo.[48] A stronghold of Mahayana Buddhism, Srivijaya attracted pilgrims and scholars from other parts of Asia.[47]\n\n\nThe relation between Srivijaya and the Chola Empire of south India was friendly during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I but during the reign of Rajendra Chola I the Chola Empire attacked Srivijaya cities.[49] A series of Chola raids in the 11th century weakened the Srivijayan hegemony and enabled the formation of regional kingdoms based, like Kediri, on intensive agriculture rather than coastal and long-distance trade. Srivijayan influence waned by the 11th century. The island was in frequent conflict with the Javanese kingdoms, first Singhasari and then Majapahit. Islam eventually made its way to the Aceh region of Sumatra, spreading its influence through contacts with Arabs and Indian traders. By the late 13th century, the kingdom of Pasai in northern Sumatra converted to Islam. The last inscription dates to 1374, where a crown prince, Ananggavarman, is mentioned. Srivijaya ceased to exist by 1414, when Parameswara, the kingdom's last prince, fled to Temasik, then to Malacca. Later his son converted to Islam and founded the Sultanate of Malacca on the Malay peninsula.\n\n\n\n### Singhasari and Majapahit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nArchaeological remains in Trowulan, the capital city of the Majapahit\n\nMain articles: Singhasari and Majapahit\n\n![](image)\nExpansion of the Majapahit empire extended to much of the Indonesian archipelago until it receded and fell in the early 16th century.\nFile:Illustration of Gajah Mada.jpg\nModern illustration of Gajah Mada, a powerful military leader, credited with bringing the empire to its peak of glory\n\nMajapahit was the most dominant of Indonesia's pre-Islamic states.[38] The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada it experienced what is often referred to as a golden age in Indonesian history,[50] when its influence extended to much of southern Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and Bali[51] from about 1293 to around 1500.\n\n\nThe founder of the Majapahit Empire, Kertarajasa, was the son-in-law of the ruler of the Singhasari kingdom, also based in Java. After Singhasari drove Srivijaya out of Java in 1290, the rising power of Singhasari came to the attention of Kublai Khan in China and he sent emissaries demanding tribute. Kertanagara, ruler of the Singhasari kingdom, refused to pay tribute and the Khan sent a punitive expedition which arrived off the coast of Java in 1293. By that time, a rebel from Kediri, Jayakatwang, had killed Kertanagara. The Majapahit founder allied himself with the Mongols against Jayakatwang and, once the Singhasari kingdom was destroyed, turned and forced his Mongol allies to withdraw in confusion.\n\n\nGajah Mada, a Majapahit prime minister and regent from 1331 to 1364, extended the empire's rule to the surrounding islands. A few years after Gajah Mada's death, the Majapahit navy captured Palembang, putting an end to the Sriwijaya kingdom. Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that passed through the archipelago. About the time Majapahit was founded, Muslim traders and proselytisers began entering the area. After its peak in the 14th century, Majapahit power began to decline and was unable to control the rising power of the Sultanate of Malacca. Dates for the end of the Majapahit Empire range from 1478 to 1520. A large number of courtiers, artisans, priests, and members of the royal family moved east to the island of Bali at the end of Majapahit power.\n\n\n\n## The age of Islamic states[edit]\n\n\n### The spread of Islam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The spread of Islam in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Map of Indonesia; 1674–1745 by Khatib Çelebi, a geographer from the Ottoman Turks.\nThe earliest accounts of the Indonesian archipelago date from the Abbasid Caliphate, according to those early accounts the Indonesian archipelago were famous among early Muslim sailors mainly due to its abundance of precious spice trade commodities such as nutmeg, cloves, galangal and many other spices.[52]\n\n\nAlthough Muslim traders first travelled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era, the spread of Islam among the inhabitants of the Indonesian archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra.[53][54]\n\n\nAlthough it is known that the spread of Islam began in the west of the archipelago, the fragmentary evidence does not suggest a rolling wave of conversion through adjacent areas; rather, it suggests the process was complicated and slow.[53] The spread of Islam was driven by increasing trade links outside of the archipelago; in general, traders and the royalty of major kingdoms were the first to adopt the new religion.[55]\n\n\nOther Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam, making it the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 7th until 13th century.[3] For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java.[55] Only Bali retained a Hindu majority. In the eastern archipelago, both Christian and Islamic missionaries were active in the 16th and 17th centuries, and, currently, there are large communities of both religions on these islands.[55]\n\n\n\n### Sultanate of Mataram[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sultanate of Mataram\n\n![](image)Gate of Masjid Agung Kotagede Mosque\nThe Sultanate of Mataram was the third Sultanate in Java, after the Sultanate of Demak Bintoro and the Sultanate of Pajang.[56]\n\n\nAccording to Javanese records, Kyai Gedhe Pamanahan became the ruler of the Mataram area in the 1570s with the support of the kingdom of Pajang to the east, near the current site of Surakarta (Solo). Pamanahan was often referred to as Kyai Gedhe Mataram after his ascension.[57]\n\n\nPamanahan's son, Panembahan Senapati, replaced his father on the throne around 1584. Under Senapati the kingdom grew substantially through regular military campaigns against Mataram's neighbours. Shortly after his accession, for example, he conquered his father's patrons in Pajang.[56]\n\n\n\nThe reign of Panembahan Seda ing Krapyak (*c.* 1601–1613), the son of Senapati, was dominated by further warfare, especially against powerful Surabaya, already a major centre in East Java. The first contact between Mataram and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) occurred under Krapyak. Dutch activities at the time were limited to trading from limited coastal settlements, so their interactions with the inland Mataram kingdom were limited, although they did form an alliance against Surabaya in 1613. Krapyak died that year.[58]\n\n![](image)Ruins of the Sultanate of Banten Palace in 1859Krapyak was succeeded by his son, who is known simply as Sultan Agung (\"Great Sultan\") in Javanese records. Agung was responsible for the great expansion and lasting historical legacy of Mataram due to the extensive military conquests of his long reign from 1613 to 1646.\n\n\n### The Sultanate of Banten[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Sultanate of Banten\n\nIn 1524–25, Sunan Gunung Jati from Cirebon, together with the armies of Demak Sultanate, seized the port of Banten from the Sunda kingdom, and established The Sultanate of Banten. This was accompanied by Muslim preachers and the adoption of Islam amongst the local population. At its peak in the first half of the 17th century, the Sultanate lasted from 1526 to 1813 AD. The Sultanate left many archaeological remains and historical records.[59]\n\n\n\n## Colonial era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dutch settlement in the East Indies. Batavia (now Jakarta), Java, c. 1665 CE.\nBeginning in the 16th century, successive waves of Europeans—the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and English—sought to dominate the spice trade at its sources in India and the 'Spice Islands' (Maluku) of Indonesia. This meant finding a way to Asia to cut out Muslim merchants who, with their Venetian outlet in the Mediterranean, monopolised spice imports to Europe. Astronomically priced at the time, spices were highly coveted not only to preserve and make poorly preserved meat palatable, but also as medicines and magic potions.[60]\n\n\nThe arrival of Europeans in South East Asia is often regarded as the watershed moment in its history. Other scholars consider this view untenable,[61] arguing that European influence during the times of the early arrivals of the 16th and 17th centuries was limited in both area and depth. This is in part due to Europe not being the most advanced or dynamic area of the world in the early 15th century. Rather, the major expansionist force of this time was Islam; in 1453, for example, the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople, while Islam continued to spread through Indonesia and the Philippines. European influence, particularly that of the Dutch, would not have its greatest impact on Indonesia until the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n\n\n### The Portuguese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Portuguese colonialism in Indonesian history\n\n![](image)The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia's Banda Islands. Once one of the world's most valuable commodities, it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia.\nNew found Portuguese expertise in navigation, shipbuilding and weaponry allowed them to make daring expeditions of exploration and expansion. Starting with the first exploratory expeditions sent from newly conquered Malacca in 1512, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Indonesia, and sought to dominate the sources of valuable spices[62] and to extend the Catholic Church's missionary efforts. The Portuguese turned east to Maluku and through both military conquest and alliance with local rulers, they established trading posts, forts, and missions on the islands of Ternate, Ambon, and Solor among others. The height of Portuguese missionary activities, however, came in the latter half of the 16th century. Ultimately, the Portuguese presence in Indonesia was reduced to Solor, Flores and Timor in modern-day Nusa Tenggara, following defeat at the hands of indigenous Ternateans and the Dutch in Maluku, and a general failure to maintain control of trade in the region.[63] In comparison with the original Portuguese ambition to dominate Asian trade, their influence on Indonesian culture was small: the romantic *keroncong* guitar ballads; a number of Indonesian words which reflect Portuguese's role as the *lingua franca* of the archipelago alongside Malay; and many family names in eastern Indonesia such as da Costa, Dias, de Fretes, Gonsalves, etc. The most significant impacts of the Portuguese arrival were the disruption and disorganisation of the trade network mostly as a result of their conquest of Malacca, and the first significant plantings of Christianity in Indonesia. There have continued to be Christian communities in eastern Indonesia through to the present, which has contributed to a sense of shared interest with Europeans, particularly among the Ambonese.[64]\n\n\n\n### Dutch East-India Company[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dutch East India Company in Indonesia\n\n![](image)An early 18th-century Dutch map from a time when only the north coastal ports of Java were well known to the Dutch\nIn 1602, the Dutch parliament awarded the VOC a monopoly on trade and colonial activities in the region at a time before the company controlled any territory in Java. In 1619, the VOC conquered the West Javan city of Jayakarta, where they founded the city of Batavia (present-day Jakarta). The VOC became deeply involved in the internal politics of Java in this period, and fought in a number of wars involving the leaders of Mataram and Banten.\n\n\nThe Dutch followed the Portuguese aspirations, courage, brutality, and strategies but brought better organisation, weapons, ships, and superior financial backing. Although they failed to gain complete control of the Indonesian spice trade, they had much more success than the previous Portuguese efforts. They exploited the factionalisation of the small kingdoms in Java that had replaced Majapahit, establishing a permanent foothold in Java, from which grew a land-based colonial empire which became one of the richest colonial possessions on earth.[64]\n\n\nBy the mid-17th century, Batavia, the headquarter of VOC in Asia, had become an important trade centre in the region. It had repelled attacks from the Javanese Mataram kingdom. In 1641, the Dutch captured Malacca from the Portuguese, thus weakened Portuguese position in Asia. The Dutch defeated the Sulawesi city of Makassar in 1667 thus bringing its trade under VOC control. Sumatran ports were also brought under VOC control and the last of the Portuguese were expelled in 1660. In return for monopoly control over the pepper trade and the expulsion of the English, the Dutch helped the son of the ruler of Banten overthrow his father in 1680. By the 18th century, the VOC has established themselves firmly in Indonesian archipelago, controlling inter-island trade as part of their Asian business which includes India, Ceylon, Formosa, and Japan. VOC has established their important bases in some ports in Java, Maluku, and parts of Sulawesi, Sumatra, and Malay Peninsula.\n\n\n\n### French and British interlude[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French and British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)The Java Great Post Road, commissioned by Daendels\nAfter the fall of the Netherlands to the First French Empire and the dissolution of the Dutch East India Company in 1800, there were profound changes in the European colonial administration of the East Indies. The company's assets in East Indies were nationalised as the Dutch colony, the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, Europe was devastated by the Napoleonic Wars. In the Netherlands, Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806 oversaw the dissolution of the Batavian Republic, which was replaced by the Kingdom of Holland, a French puppet kingdom ruled by Napoleon's third brother Louis Bonaparte (Lodewijk Napoleon). The East Indies were treated as a proxy French colony, administered through a Dutch intermediary.\n\n\nIn 1806, King Lodewijk of the Netherlands sent one of his generals, Herman Willem Daendels, to serve as governor-general of the East Indies, based in Java. Daendels was sent to strengthen Javanese defences against a predicted British invasion. Since 1685, the British had had a presence in Bencoolen on the western coast of Sumatra, as well as several posts north of the Malaccan straits. Daendels was responsible for the construction of the Great Post Road (Indonesian: *Jalan Raya Pos*) across northern Java from Anjer to Panaroecan. The thousand-kilometre road was meant as to ease logistics across Java and was completed in only one year, during which thousands of Javanese forced labourers died.[65] In 1811, Java was captured by the British, becoming a possession of the British Empire, and Thomas Stamford Raffles was appointed as the island's governor. Raffles launched several military expeditions against local Javanese princes; such as the assault on Yogyakarta kraton on 21 June 1812, and the military expedition against Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II of Palembang, along with giving orders to seize the nearby Bangka Island.[66][67] During his administration, numbers of ancient monuments in Java were rediscovered, excavated and systematically catalogued for the first time, the most important one being the rediscovery of Borobudur Buddhist temple in Central Java.[68][69] Raffles was an enthusiast of the island's history, as he wrote the book History of Java published later in 1817. In 1815, the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the end of Napoleonic Wars, under the terms of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.[70]\n\n\n\n### Dutch state rule[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)Batavian (Jakarta) tea factory in the 1860s\nAfter the VOC was dissolved in 1800 following bankruptcy,[71] and after the end of British rule under Raffles' governorship, the Dutch state took over the VOC possessions in 1816. A Javanese uprising was crushed in the Java War of 1825–1830. After 1830, a system of forced cultivations and indentured labour was introduced on Java, the Cultivation System (in Dutch: *cultuurstelsel*). This system brought the Dutch and their Indonesian allies enormous wealth. The cultivation system tied peasants to their land, forcing them to work in government-owned plantations for 60 days of the year. The system was abolished in a more liberal period after 1870. In 1901, the Dutch adopted what they called the Ethical Policy, which included somewhat increased investment in indigenous education, and modest political reforms.\n\n\n\n![](image)Dutch imperial painting depicting the Dutch East Indies as \"our most precious gem\" (1916)\nThe Dutch colonials formed a privileged upper social class of soldiers, administrators, managers, teachers, and pioneers. They lived together with the \"natives\", but at the top of a rigid social and racial caste system.[72][73] The Dutch East Indies had two legal classes of citizens; European and indigenous. A third class, Foreign Easterners, was added in 1920.[74]\n\n\nUpgrading the infrastructure of ports and roads was a high priority for the Dutch, with the goal of modernising the economy, pumping wages into local areas, facilitating commerce, and speeding up military movements. By 1950, Dutch engineers had built and upgraded a road network with 12,000 km of asphalted surface, 41,000 km of metalled road area and 16,000 km of gravel surfaces.[75] In addition the Dutch built 7,500 kilometres (4,700 mi) of railways, bridges, irrigation systems covering 1.4 million hectares (5,400 sq mi) of rice fields, several harbours, and 140 public drinking water systems. These Dutch constructed public works became the economic base of the colonial state; after independence, they became the basis of the Indonesian infrastructure.[76]\n\n\nFor most of the colonial period, Dutch control over its territories in the Indonesian archipelago was tenuous. In some cases, Dutch police and military actions in parts of Indonesia were quite cruel. Recent discussions, for example, of Dutch cruelty in Aceh have encouraged renewed research on these aspects of Dutch rule.[77] It was only in the early 20th century, three centuries after the first Dutch trading post, that the full extent of the colonial territory was established and direct colonial rule exerted across what would become the boundaries of the modern Indonesian state.[78] Portuguese Timor, now East Timor, remained under Portuguese rule until 1975 when it was invaded by Indonesia. The Indonesian government declared the territory an Indonesian province but relinquished it in 1999.\n\n\n\n## The emergence of Indonesia[edit]\n\n\n### Indonesian National Awakening[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian National Awakening\n\n![](image)Sukarno, Indonesian Nationalist leader, and later, first president of Indonesia\nIn October 1908, the first nationalist movement was formed, Budi Utomo.[79] On 10 September 1912, the first nationalist mass movement was formed: Sarekat Islam.[80] By December 1912, Sarekat Islam had 93,000 members.[80] The Dutch responded after the First World War with repressive measures. The nationalist leaders came from a small group of young professionals and students, some of whom had been educated in the Netherlands. In the post–World War I era, the Indonesian communists who were associated with the Third International started to usurp the nationalist movement.[81] The repression of the nationalist movement led to many arrests, including Indonesia's first president, Sukarno (1901–70), who was imprisoned for political activities on 29 December 1929.[82] Also arrested was Mohammad Hatta, first vice-president of Indonesia.[83] Additionally, Sutan Sjahrir, who later became the first Prime Minister of Indonesia, was arrested on this date.[84]\n\n\nIn 1914 the exiled Dutch socialist Henk Sneevliet founded the Indies Social Democratic Association. Initially a small forum of Dutch socialists, it would later evolve into the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) in 1924.[85] In the post–World War I era, the Dutch strongly repressed all attempts at change. This repression led to a growth of the PKI. By December 1924, the PKI had a membership of 1,140.[85] One year later in 1925, the PKI had grown to 3,000 members.[85] From 1926 to 1927, there was a PKI-led revolt against Dutch colonialism and the harsh repression of strikes of urban workers.[86] However, the strikes and the revolt was put down by the Dutch with some 13,000 nationalists and communists leaders were arrested.[86] Some 4,500 were given prison sentences.[86]\n\n\nSukarno was released from prison in December 1931 [87] but was re-arrested on 1 August 1933.[88]\n\n\n\n### Japanese occupation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)Japanese bicycle infantry move through Java during their occupation of the Dutch East Indies.\nThe Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during World War II interrupted Dutch rule[89][90] and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. In May 1940, early in World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands, but the Dutch government-in-exile initially continued to control the Dutch East Indies from its base in London. The Dutch East Indies declared a state of siege and in July 1940 redirected exports intended for Japan to the US and Britain. Negotiations with the Japanese aimed at securing supplies of aviation fuel collapsed in June 1941, and the Japanese started their conquest of Southeast Asia in December of that year.[91] That same month, factions from Sumatra sought Japanese assistance for a revolt against the Dutch wartime government. The Japanese military defeated last Dutch forces in the East Indies in March 1942.\n\n\n\n![](image)Japanese commanders in the Dutch East Indies during the surrender\nIn July 1942, Sukarno accepted Japan's offer to rally the public in support of the Japanese war effort. Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta were decorated by the Emperor of Japan in 1943. However, experience of the Japanese occupation of Dutch East Indies varied considerably, depending upon where one lived and one's social position. Many who lived in areas considered important to the war effort experienced torture, sex slavery, arbitrary arrest and execution, and other war crimes. Thousands taken away from Indonesia as war labourers (romusha) suffered or died as a result of ill-treatment and starvation. People of Dutch and mixed Dutch-Indonesian descent were particular targets of the Japanese occupation.\n\n\nIn March 1945, the Japanese established the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK) as the initial stage of the establishment of independence for the area under the control of the Japanese 16th Army.[92] At its first meeting in May, Soepomo spoke of national integration and against personal individualism, while Muhammad Yamin suggested that the new nation should claim British Borneo, British Malaya, Portuguese Timor, and all the pre-war territories of the Dutch East Indies. The committee drafted the 1945 Constitution, which remains in force, though now much amended. On 9 August 1945 Sukarno, Hatta, and Radjiman Wediodiningrat were flown to meet Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi in Vietnam. They were told that Japan intended to announce Indonesian independence on 24 August. After the Japanese surrender, however, Sukarno unilaterally proclaimed Indonesian independence on 17 August. A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of the Japanese occupation.[93]\n\n\n\n### Indonesian National Revolution[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian National Revolution\n\n![](image)Indonesian flag raising shortly after the declaration of independence\nUnder pressure from radical and politicised *pemuda* ('youth') groups, Sukarno and Hatta on behalf of the Nation proclaimed Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945 from colonialism by foreign nations two days after the Japanese Emperor's surrender in the Pacific, and made this nation an independent state, which has the right to govern its people and nation in accordance with the philosophy, character and spirit of the Indonesia nation itself.[94] The following day, the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) declared Sukarno President and Hatta Vice-President.[95][96][97][98][99] Word of the proclamation spread by shortwave and fliers while the Indonesian war-time military (PETA), youths, and others rallied in support of the new republic, often moving to take over government offices from the Japanese. In December 1946 the United Nations acknowledged[100] that Netherlands had advised the United Nations that the \"Netherlands Indies\" was a non-self-governing territory (colony) for which the Netherlands had a legal duty to make yearly reports and to assist towards \"a full measure of self-government\" as required by the *Charter of the United Nations article 73*.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sukarno speaking at the *Rapat Akbar* (grand meeting) on 19 September 1945\nThe Dutch, initially backed by the British, tried to re-establish their rule,[101] and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure,[102] the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence.[97][101] Dutch efforts to re-establish complete control met resistance. At the end of World War II, a power vacuum arose, and the nationalists often succeeded in seizing the arms of the demoralised Japanese. A period of unrest with city guerrilla warfare called the Bersiap period ensued. Groups of Indonesian nationalists armed with improvised weapons (like bamboo spears) and firearms attacked returning Allied troops. 3,500 Europeans were killed and 20,000 were missing, meaning there were more European deaths in Indonesia after the war than during the war. After returning to Java, Dutch forces quickly re-occupied the colonial capital of Batavia (now Jakarta), so the city of Yogyakarta in central Java became the capital of the nationalist forces. Negotiations with the nationalists led to two major truce agreements, but disputes about their implementation, and much mutual provocation, led each time to renewed conflict. Within four years the Dutch had recaptured almost the whole of Indonesia, but guerrilla resistance persisted, led on Java by commander Nasution. On 27 December 1949, after four years of sporadic warfare and fierce criticism of the Dutch by the UN, the Netherlands officially recognised Indonesian sovereignty under the federal structure of the United States of Indonesia (RUSI). With the unification of all the kingdoms in the archipelago On 17 August 1950, exactly five years after the proclamation of independence, the last of the federal states were dissolved and Sukarno proclaimed a single unitary Republic of Indonesia until now.[103][94]\n\n\n\n## Sukarno's presidency[edit]\n\n\n### Democratic experiment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Liberal democracy period in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Campaign posters for the 1955 Indonesian election\nWith the unifying struggle to secure Indonesia's independence over, divisions in Indonesian society began to appear. These included regional differences in customs, religion, the impact of Christianity and Marxism, and fears of Javanese political domination. Following colonial rule, Japanese occupation, and war against the Dutch, the new country suffered from severe poverty, a ruinous economy, low educational and skills levels, and authoritarian traditions.[104][105] Challenges to the authority of the Republic included the militant *Darul Islam* who waged a guerrilla struggle against the Republic from 1948 to 1962; the declaration of an independent Republic of South Maluku by Ambonese formerly of the Royal Dutch Indies Army; and rebellions in Sumatra and Sulawesi between 1955 and 1961.\n\n\nIn contrast to the 1945 Constitution, the 1950 constitution mandated a parliamentary system of government, an executive responsible to parliament, and stipulated at length constitutional guarantees for human rights, drawing heavily on the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[106] A proliferation of political parties dealing for shares of cabinet seats resulted in a rapid turnover of coalition governments including 17 cabinets between 1945 and 1958. The long-postponed parliamentary elections were held in 1955; although the Indonesian National Party (PNI)—considered Sukarno's party—topped the poll, and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) received strong support, no party garnered more than a quarter of the votes, which resulted in short-lived coalitions.[105]\n\n\n\n### Guided Democracy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Guided Democracy in Indonesia\n\n![](image)National emblem of the Republic of Indonesia, adopted in 1950\nBy 1956, Sukarno was openly criticising parliamentary democracy, stating that it was \"based upon inherent conflict\" which ran counter to Indonesian notions of harmony as being the natural state of human relationships. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, under the guidance of village elders. He proposed a threefold blend of *nasionalisme* ('nationalism'), *agama* ('religion'), and *komunisme* ('communism') into a co-operative 'Nas-A-Kom' government. This was intended to appease the three main factions in Indonesian politics — the army, Islamic groups, and the communists. With the support of the military, he proclaimed in February 1957 a system of 'Guided Democracy', and proposed a cabinet representing all the political parties of importance (including the PKI).[105] The US tried and failed to secretly overthrow the president, even though Secretary of State Dulles declared before Congress that \"we are not interested in the internal affairs of this country.\"[107]\n\n\nSukarno abrogated the 1950 Constitution on 9 July 1959 by a decree dissolving the Constitutional Assembly and restoring the 1945 Constitution.[105] The elected parliament was replaced by one appointed by, and subject to the will of, the president. Another non-elected body, the Supreme Advisory Council, was the main policy development body, while the National Front was set up in September 1960 and presided over by the president to \"mobilise the revolutionary forces of the people\".[105] Western-style parliamentary democracy was thus finished in Indonesia until the 1999 elections of the *Reformasi* era.[105]\n\n\n\n### Sukarno's revolution and nationalism[edit]\n\n\nCharismatic Sukarno spoke as a romantic revolutionary, and under his increasingly authoritarian rule, Indonesia moved on a course of stormy nationalism. Sukarno was popularly referred to as *bang* (\"older brother\"), and he painted himself as a man of the people carrying the aspirations of Indonesia and one who dared take on the West.[108] He instigated a number of large, ideologically driven infrastructure projects and monuments celebrating Indonesia's identity, which were criticised as substitutes for real development in a deteriorating economy.[108]\n\n\nWestern New Guinea had been part of the Dutch East Indies, and Indonesian nationalists had thus claimed it on this basis. Indonesia was able to instigate a diplomatic and military confrontation with the Dutch over the territory following an Indonesian-Soviet arms agreement in 1960. It was, however, United States pressure on the Netherlands that led to an Indonesian takeover in 1963.[109] Also in 1963, Indonesia commenced *Konfrontasi* with the new state of Malaysia. The northern states of Borneo, formerly British Sarawak and Sabah, had wavered in joining Malaysia, whilst Indonesia saw itself as the rightful ruler of Austronesian peoples and supported an unsuccessful revolution attempt in Brunei.[109] Reviving the glories of the Indonesian National Revolution, Sukarno increased the anti-British sentiment in his rhetoric and mounted military offensives along the Indonesia-Malaysia border in Borneo. As the PKI rallied in Jakarta streets in support, the West became increasingly alarmed at Indonesian foreign policy and the United States withdrew its aid to Indonesia.[109]\n\n\nIn social policy, Sukarno's time in office witnessed substantial reforms in health and education,[110] together with the passage of various pro-labour measures.[111] However, Indonesia's economic position deteriorated under Sukarno; by the mid-1960s, the cash-strapped government had to scrap critical public sector subsidies, inflation was at 1,000%, export revenues were shrinking, infrastructure crumbling, and factories were operating at minimal capacity with negligible investment. Severe poverty and hunger were widespread.[109][112]\n\n\n\n## The New Order[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Order (Indonesia)\n\n### Transition to the New Order[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transition to the New Order\n\nSee also: 30 September Movement and Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66\n\n![](image)During the mid-20th century. It was the largest non-ruling communist party in the world before its eradication in 1965 and ban the following year.\nDescribed as the great *dalang* (\"puppet master\"), Sukarno's position depended on balancing the opposing and increasingly hostile forces of the army and the PKI. Sukarno's anti-imperialist ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on Soviet and then communist China. By 1965, the PKI was the largest communist party in the world outside the Soviet Union or China. Penetrating all levels of government, the party increasingly gained influence at the expense of the army.[113]\n\n\nOn 30 September 1965, six of the most senior generals within the military and other officers were assassinated in an attempted coup. The insurgents, known later as the 30 September Movement, backed a rival faction of the army and took up positions in the capital, later seizing control of the national radio station. They claimed they were acting against a plot organised by the generals to overthrow Sukarno. Within a few hours, Major General Suharto, commander of the Army Strategic Reserve (Kostrad), mobilised counteraction, and by the evening of 1 October, it was clear that the coup, which had little co-ordination and was largely limited to Jakarta, had failed. Complicated and partisan theories continue to this day over the identity of the attempted coup's organisers and their aims. According to the Indonesian army, the PKI were behind the coup and used disgruntled army officers to carry it out, and this became the official account of Suharto's subsequent New Order administration. Although there is not broad agreement on who bears ultimate responsibility for the coup or even if there was really a single mastermind controlling all events, modern evidence has suggested at least a role played by Western intelligence agencies including the American Central Intelligence Agency[114][115] and the United Kingdom's MI6.[116]\n\n\nThe PKI was blamed for the coup, and anti-communists, initially following the army's lead, went on a violent anti-communist purge across much of the country. The PKI was effectively destroyed,[117][118][119] and the most widely accepted estimates are that between 500,000 and 1 million were killed.[120][121][122] The violence was especially brutal in Java and Bali. The PKI was outlawed and possibly more than 1 million of its leaders and affiliates were imprisoned.[122] The United States and other Western powers facilitated and supported the purge.[123][124][125]\n\n\nThroughout the 1965–66 period, President Sukarno attempted to restore his political position and shift the country back to its pre-October 1965 position but his Guided Democracy balancing act was destroyed with the PKI's demise. Although he remained president, the weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who by that time had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS) named General Suharto acting president. Suharto was formally appointed president in March 1968. Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970.\n\n\n\n### Consolidation of the New Order[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Suharto was the military president of Indonesia from 1967 to 1998.\nIn the aftermath of Suharto's rise, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or imprisoned by the military and religious groups in a backlash against alleged communist supporters, with direct support from the United States.[126][127] Suharto's administration is commonly called the *New Order* era.[128] Suharto invited major foreign investment, which produced substantial, if uneven, economic growth. However, Suharto enriched himself and his family through business dealings and widespread corruption.[129]\n\n\n\n### Annexation of West Irian[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Western New Guinea Dispute and Operation Trikora\n\nAt the time of independence, the Dutch retained control over the western half of New Guinea (also known as West Irian), and permitted steps towards self-government and a declaration of independence on 1 December 1961. After negotiations with the Dutch on the incorporation of the territory into Indonesia failed, an Indonesian paratroop invasion 18 December preceded armed clashes between Indonesian and Dutch troops in 1961 and 1962. In 1962 the United States pressured the Netherlands into secret talks with Indonesia which in August 1962 produced the New York Agreement, and Indonesia assumed administrative responsibility for West Irian on 1 May 1963.\n\n\nRejecting UN supervision, the Indonesian government under Suharto decided to settle the question of West Irian, the former Dutch New Guinea, in their favour. Rather than a referendum of all residents of West Irian as had been agreed under Sukarno, an 'Act of Free Choice' was conducted in 1969 in which 1,025 Papuan representatives of local councils were selected by the Indonesians. They were warned to vote in favour of Indonesian integration with the group unanimously voting for integration with Indonesia.[130] A subsequent UN General Assembly resolution confirmed the transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia.\n\n\nWest Irian was renamed Irian Jaya ('glorious Irian') in 1973. Opposition to Indonesian administration of Irian Jaya (later known as Papua) gave rise to guerrilla activity in the years following Jakarta's assumption of control.\n\n\n\n### Annexation of East Timor[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian occupation of East Timor\n\n![](image)Timorese women with the Indonesian national flag\nIn 1975, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal caused authorities there to announce plans for decolonisation of Portuguese Timor, the eastern half of the island of Timor whose western half was a part of the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara. In the East Timorese elections held in 1975, Fretilin, a left-leaning party, and UDT, aligned with the local elite, emerged as the largest parties, having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence from Portugal. Apodeti, a party advocating integration with Indonesia, enjoyed little popular support.\n\n\nIndonesia alleged that Fretilin was communist, and feared that an independent East Timor would influence separatism in the archipelago. Indonesian military intelligence influenced the break-up of the alliance between Fretilin and UDT, which led to a coup by the UDT on 11 August 1975 and the start of a month-long civil war. During this time, the Portuguese government effectively abandoned the territory and did not resume the decolonisation process. On 28 November, Fretilin unilaterally declared independence, and proclaimed the 'Democratic Republic of East Timor'. Nine days later, on 7 December, Indonesia invaded East Timor, eventually annexing the tiny country of (then) 680,000 people. Indonesia was supported materially and diplomatically by the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, who regarded Indonesia as an anti-communist ally.\n\n\nFollowing the 1998 resignation of Suharto, the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence in a UN-sponsored referendum held on 30 August 1999. About 99% of the eligible population participated; more than three quarters chose independence despite months of attacks by the Indonesian military and its militia. After the result was announced, elements of the Indonesian military and its militia retaliated by killing approximately 2,000 East Timorese, displacing two-thirds of the population, raping hundreds of women and girls, and destroying much of the country's infrastructure. In October 1999, the Indonesian parliament (MPR) revoked the decree that annexed East Timor, and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) assumed responsibility for governing East Timor until it officially became an independent state in May 2002.\n\n\n\n### Transmigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transmigration program\n\nThe Transmigration program (*Transmigrasi*) was a National Government initiative to move landless people from densely populated areas of Indonesia (such as Java and Bali) to less populous areas of the country including Papua, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi. The stated purpose of this program was to reduce the considerable poverty and overpopulation on Java, to provide opportunities for hard-working poor people, and to provide a workforce to better utilise the resources of the outer islands. The program, however, has been controversial, with critics accusing the Indonesian Government of trying to use these migrants to reduce the proportion of native populations in destination areas to weaken separatist movements. The program has often been cited as a major and ongoing factor in controversies and even conflict and violence between settlers and indigenous populations.\n\n\n\n## Reform Era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Post-Suharto era\n\nSee also: Indonesian Revolution of 1998\n\n### Pro-democracy movement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University students and police forces clash in May 1998\nIn 1996, Suharto undertook efforts to pre-empt a challenge to the New Order government. The Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), a legal party that had traditionally propped up the regime, had changed direction and began to assert its independence. Suharto fostered a split over the leadership of PDI, backing a co-opted faction loyal to deputy speaker of the People's Representative Council Suryadi against a faction loyal to Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Sukarno and the PDI's chairperson.\n\n\nAfter the Suryadi faction announced a party congress to sack Megawati would be held in Medan on 20–22 June, Megawati proclaimed that her supporters would hold demonstrations in protest. The Suryadi faction went through with its sacking of Megawati, and the demonstrations manifested themselves throughout Indonesia. This led to several confrontations on the streets between protesters and security forces, and recriminations over the violence. The protests culminated in the military allowing Megawati's supporters to take over PDI headquarters in Jakarta, with a pledge of no further demonstrations.\n\n\nSuharto allowed the occupation of PDI headquarters to go on for almost a month, as attentions were also on Jakarta due to a set of high-profile ASEAN meetings scheduled to take place there. Capitalizing on this, Megawati supporters organised \"democracy forums\" with several speakers at the site. On 26 July, officers of the military, Suryadi, and Suharto openly aired their disgust with the forums.[131]\n\n\nOn 27 July, police, soldiers, and persons claiming to be Suryadi supporters stormed the headquarters. Several Megawati supporters were killed, and over two hundred people were arrested and tried under the Anti-Subversion and Hate-Spreading laws. The day would become known as \"Black Saturday\" and mark the beginning of a renewed crackdown by the New Order government against supporters of democracy, now called the \"Reformasi\" or Reform movement.[132]\n\n\n\n### Economic crisis and Suharto's resignation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fall of Suharto\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis,[133] which had dire consequences for the Indonesian economy and society, as well as Suharto's presidency. At the same time, the country suffered a severe drought and some of the largest forest fires in history burned in Kalimantan and Sumatra. The rupiah, the Indonesian currency, took a sharp dive in value. Suharto came under scrutiny from international lending institutions, chiefly the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United States, over longtime embezzlement of funds and some protectionist policies. In December, Suharto's government signed a letter of intent to the IMF, pledging to enact austerity measures, including cuts to public services and removal of subsidies, in return for aid from the IMF and other donors. Prices for goods such as kerosene and rice, as well as fees for public services including education, rose dramatically. The effects were exacerbated by widespread corruption. The austerity measures approved by Suharto had started to erode domestic confidence with the New Order[134] and led to popular protests.\n\n\nSuharto stood for re-election by parliament for the seventh time in March 1998, justifying it on the grounds of the necessity of his leadership during the crisis. The parliament approved a new term. This sparked protests and riots throughout the country, now termed the Indonesian 1998 Revolution. Dissent within the ranks of his own Golkar party and the military finally weakened Suharto, and on 21 May he stood down from power.[135] He was replaced by his deputy, Vice President B.J. Habibie.\n\n\nPresident Habibie quickly assembled a cabinet. One of its main tasks was to re-establish International Monetary Fund and donor community support for an economic stabilisation program. He moved quickly to release political prisoners and lift some controls on freedom of speech and association. Elections for the national, provincial, and sub-provincial parliaments were held on 7 June 1999. In the elections for the national parliament, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P, led by Sukarno's daughter Megawati Sukarnoputri) won 34% of the vote; Golkar (Suharto's party, formerly the only legal party of government) 22%; United Development Party (PPP, led by Hamzah Haz) 12%; and National Awakening Party (PKB, led by Abdurrahman Wahid) 10%.\n\n\n\n\n### May 1998 riots of Indonesia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: May 1998 riots of Indonesia\n\nThe May 1998 riots of Indonesia also known as the 1998 tragedy or simply the 1998 event, were incidents of mass violence, demonstrations, and civil unrest of a racial nature that occurred throughout Indonesia.\n\n\n\n### Politics since 1999[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Indonesian 2009 election ballot. Since 2004, Indonesians are able to vote their president directly.\nIn October 1999, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), which consists of the 500-member Parliament plus 200 appointed members, elected Abdurrahman Wahid, commonly referred to as \"Gus Dur\", as President, and Megawati Sukarnoputri as Vice-President, both for five-year terms. Wahid named his first Cabinet in early November 1999 and a reshuffled, second Cabinet in August 2000. President Wahid's government continued to pursue democratisation and to encourage renewed economic growth under challenging conditions. In addition to continuing economic malaise, his government faced regional, interethnic, and interreligious conflict, particularly in Aceh, the Maluku Islands, and Irian Jaya. In West Timor, the problems of displaced East Timorese and violence by pro-Indonesian East Timorese militias caused considerable humanitarian and social problems. An increasingly assertive Parliament frequently challenged President Wahid's policies and prerogatives, contributing to a lively and sometimes rancorous national political debate.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the People's Consultative Assembly's first annual session in August 2000, President Wahid gave an account of his government's performance. On 29 January 2001, thousands of student protesters stormed parliament grounds and demanded that President Abdurrahman Wahid resign due to alleged involvement in corruption scandals. Under pressure from the Assembly to improve management and co-ordination within the government, he issued a presidential decree giving Vice-President Megawati control over the day-to-day administration of government. Soon after, Megawati Sukarnoputri assumed the presidency on 23 July. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won Indonesia's first direct presidential election in 2004,[136] and was reelected in 2009.[137]\n\n\nJoko Widodo, the PDI-P candidate, was elected president in 2014. Having previously served as the Governor of Jakarta, he is the first Indonesian president without a high-ranking political or military background.[138] However, his opponent Prabowo Subianto disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed.[139] Jokowi was reelected in 2019, again defeating Prabowo Subianto.\n\n\n\n### Terrorism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Terrorism in Indonesia\n\nAs a multi-ethnic and multicultural democratic country with a Muslim-majority population, Indonesia faces the challenge of dealing with terrorism linked to global militant Islamic movements. Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), a militant Islamic organisation that aspires for the establishment of a Daulah Islamiyah[140] across Southeast Asia, is responsible for a series of terrorist attacks in Indonesia. This terrorist organisation, linked to Al-Qaeda, was responsible for the Bali bombings in 2002 and 2005, as well as Jakarta bombings in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The Indonesian government and authorities have tried to crack down on terrorist cells in Indonesia.\n\n\nOn 14 January 2016, suicide bombers and gunmen initiated a terror attack in Jakarta, resulting in the death of eight people: three Indonesian civilians, a Canadian and four of the attackers. Twenty people were wounded during the attack. The Islamic state claimed responsibility for the incident.\n\n\n\n### Tsunami disaster and Aceh peace deal[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Indonesia\n\nOn 26 December 2004, a massive earthquake and tsunami devastated parts of northern Sumatra, particularly Aceh. Partly as a result of the need for co-operation and peace during the recovery from the tsunami in Aceh, peace talks between the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) were restarted. Accords signed in Helsinki created a framework for military de-escalation in which the government has reduced its military presence, as members of GAM's armed wing decommission their weapons and apply for amnesty. The agreement also allows for local parties to be established, and other autonomy measures.\n\n\n\n### Forest and plantation fires[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Southeast Asian haze, 1997 Southeast Asian haze, and 2015 Southeast Asian haze\n\nSince 1997 Indonesia has been struggling to contain forest fires, especially on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan. Haze occurs annually during the dry season and is largely caused by illegal agricultural fires due to slash-and-burn practices in Indonesia, especially in the provinces of South Sumatra and Riau on Indonesia's Sumatra island, and Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo.[141][142][143] The haze that occurred in 1997 was one of the most severe; dense hazes occurred again in 2005, 2006, 2009, 2013, and the worst was in 2015, killing dozens of Indonesians as a result of respiratory illnesses and road accidents due to poor visibility. Another 10 people were killed due to smog from forest and land fires.[144][145][146][147][148]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Indonesia ratified the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, becoming the last ASEAN country to do so.[149]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n\n\n* Foreign relations of Indonesia\n* History of Southeast Asia\n* List of presidents of Indonesia\n* Politics of Indonesia\n\n\nMuseums\n\n* Jakarta History Museum\n* National Museum of Indonesia\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Burhanudin, Jajat, and Kees van Dijk, eds. *Islam in Indonesia: Contrasting Images and Interpretations* (Amsterdam University Press, distributed by University of Chicago Press; 2013) 279 pages; scholarly articles\n* Dijk, Kees van. 2001. *A country in despair.

Indonesia is an archipelagic country of 16,000 to 17,000 islands (16,056 named and around 6,000 are inhabited) stretching along the equator in Southeast Asia.[1][2] The country's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade; trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history. The area of Indonesia is populated by peoples of various migrations, creating a diversity of cultures, ethnicities, and languages. The archipelago's landforms and climate significantly influenced agriculture and trade, and the formation of states. The boundaries of the state of Indonesia match the 20th-century borders of the Dutch East Indies.\n\n\nFossilised remains of *Homo erectus*, popularly known as \"Java Man\", and their tools suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited at least 1.5 million years ago. Austronesian people, who form the majority of the modern population, are thought to have originally been from Taiwan and arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE. From the 7th century CE, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished, bringing Hindu and Buddhist influences with it. The agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties subsequently thrived in inland Java. The last significant non-Muslim kingdom, the Hindu Majapahit kingdom, flourished from the late 13th century, and its influence stretched over much of Indonesia. The earliest evidence of Islamised populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra; other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam, which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century.[3] For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences.\n\n\nEuropeans such as the Portuguese arrived in Indonesia from the 16th century seeking to monopolise the sources of valuable nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in Maluku. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (*Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie* or VOC) and became the dominant European power by 1610. Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies under government control. By the early 20th century, Dutch dominance extended to the current boundaries. The Japanese invasion and occupation in 1942–1945 during WWII ended Dutch rule, and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, nationalist leader Sukarno declared independence and became president. The Netherlands tried to reestablish its rule, but a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence.\n\n\nAn attempted coup in 1965 led to a violent army-led anti-communist purge in which over half a million people were killed. General Suharto politically outmanoeuvred President Sukarno, and became president in March 1968. His New Order administration garnered the favour of the West, whose investment in Indonesia was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth. In the late 1990s, however, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis, which led to popular protests and Suharto's resignation on 21 May 1998. The *Reformasi* era following Suharto's resignation has led to a strengthening of democratic processes, including a regional autonomy program, the secession of East Timor, and the first direct presidential election in 2004. Political instability, social unrest, corruption, natural disasters, and terrorism remained problems in the 2000s, but the economy has performed strongly since 2007. Although relations between different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas.\n\n\nToday, Indonesia is a diverse and multicultural nation with a population of over 270 million people. The country is known for its natural beauty, rich cultural heritage, and significant contributions to global art, music, and cuisine. It is also one of the world's fastest-growing economies and a major player in the Southeast Asian region.\n\n\n\n\n## Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Indonesia\n\n![](image)\nThe replica of Java man skull, originally discovered in Sangiran, Central Java\n![](image)\nThe syntype fossils of Java Man (*H. e. erectus*), at Naturalis, Leiden\n\nIn 2007, an analysis of cut marks on two bovid bones found in Sangiran, showed them to have been made 1.5 to 1.6 million years ago by clamshell tools. This is the oldest evidence for the presence of early humans in Indonesia. Fossilised remains of *Homo erectus* in Indonesia, popularly known as the \"Java Man\" were first discovered by the Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois at Trinil in 1891, and are at least 700,000 years old. Other *H. erectus* fossils of a similar age were found at Sangiran in the 1930s by the anthropologist Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald, who in the same time period also uncovered fossils at Ngandong alongside more advanced tools, re-dated in 2011 to between 550,000 and 143,000 years old.[4][5][6][7] In 1977 another *H. erectus* skull was discovered at Sambungmacan.[8] In 2010, stone tools were discovered on Flores, dating from 1 million years ago. These are the earliest remains implying human seafaring technology.[9] The earliest evidence of artistic activity ever found, in the form of diagonal etchings made with the use of a shark's tooth, was detected in 2014 on a 500,000-year-old fossil of a clam found in Java in the 1890s, associated with *H. erectus*.[10]\n\n\nIn 2003, on the island of Flores, fossils of a 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall hominid dated between 74,000 and 13,000 years old were discovered, much to the surprise of the scientific community. This newly discovered hominid was named the \"Flores Man\", or *Homo floresiensis*.[11][12] A phylogenetic analysis published in 2017 suggests that *H. floresiensis* was descended from the same ancestor as *Homo habilis.*[13] *H. floresiensis* would thus represent a previously unknown and very early migration out of Africa. The *Homo floresiensis* skeletal material is dated from 60,000 to 100,000 years ago; stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains were from archaeological horizons ranging from 50,000 to 190,000 years ago.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Megalithic statue found in Tegurwangi, Sumatra, Indonesia, 1500 CE\nThe Indonesian archipelago was formed during the thaw after the Last Glacial Maximum. Early humans travelled by sea and spread from mainland Asia eastward to New Guinea and Australia. *Homo sapiens* reached the region by around 45,000 years ago.[15] In 2011, evidence was uncovered in neighbouring East Timor, showing that 42,000 years ago, these early settlers had high-level maritime skills, and by implication the technology needed to make ocean crossings to reach Australia and other islands, as they were catching and consuming large numbers of big deep sea fish such as tuna.[16]\n\n\nAn elaborate 4.5 m long rock art panel in a limestone cave at Leang Bulu' in Sulawesi is currently considered the earliest figurative artwork in the world.[17] It portrays several figures hunting wild pigs and dwarf bovids. This rock art was dated to at least 43.9 ka on the basis of uranium-series analysis of overlying speleothems. A painted hand stencil from Leang Timpuseng, which has a minimum age of 39.9 kyr, is now the oldest known hand stencil in the world.[18]\n\n\nAustronesian people form the majority of the modern population. They may have arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE and are thought to have originated in Taiwan.[19] During this period, parts of Indonesia participated in the Maritime Jade Road, whith outlets in Kalimantan which existed for 3,000 years between 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.[20][21][22][23] Dong Son culture spread to Indonesia bringing with it techniques of wet-field rice cultivation, ritual buffalo sacrifice, bronze casting, megalithic practises, and ikat weaving methods. Some of these practices remain in areas including the Batak areas of Sumatra, Toraja in Sulawesi, and several islands in Nusa Tenggara. Early Indonesians were animists who honoured the spirits of the dead believing their souls or life force could still help the living.\n\n\n\n![](image)Example of Rice Terraces in Indonesia\nIdeal agricultural conditions, and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the 8th century BCE,[24] allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century CE. These kingdoms (little more than collections of villages subservient to petty chieftains) evolved with their own ethnic and tribal religions. Java's hot and even temperature, abundant rain and volcanic soil, was perfect for wet rice cultivation. Such agriculture required a well-organized society, in contrast to the society based on dry-field rice, which is a much simpler form of cultivation that does not require an elaborate social structure to support it.\n\n\nBuni culture clay pottery flourished in coastal northern West Java and Banten around 400 BCE to 100 CE.[25] The Buni culture was probably the predecessor of the Tarumanagara kingdom, one of the earliest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia, producing numerous inscriptions and marking the beginning of the historical period in Java.\n\n\nOn 11 December 2019, a team of researchers led by Dr. Maxime Aubert announced the discovery of the oldest hunting scenes in prehistoric art in the world which is more than 44,000 years old from the limestone cave of Leang Bulu' Sipong 4. Archaeologists determined the age of the depiction of hunting a pig and buffalo thanks to the calcite 'popcorn', different isotope levels of radioactive uranium and thorium.[26][27][28]\n\n\n\n## Hindu-Buddhist civilizations[edit]\n\n\n### Early kingdom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1600-year-old stone inscription from the era of Purnawarman, king of Tarumanagara, founded in Tugu sub-district of Jakarta\nIndonesia like much of Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture.[29] From the 2nd century, through the Indian dynasties like the Pallava, Gupta, Pala and Chola in the succeeding centuries up to the 12th century, Indian culture spread across all of Southeast Asia.[29]\n\n\nReferences to the Dvipantara or Yawadvipa, a Hindu kingdom in Java and Sumatra appear in Sanskrit writings from 200 BCE. In India's earliest epic, the Ramayana, Sugriva, the chief of Rama's army dispatched his men to Yawadvipa, the island of Java, in search of Sita.[30] According to the ancient Tamil text Manimekalai Java had a kingdom with a capital called Nagapuram.[31][32][33] The earliest archaeological relic discovered in Indonesia is from the Ujung Kulon National Park, West Java, where an early Hindu statue of Ganesha estimated from the 1st century CE was found on the summit of Mount Raksa in Panaitan island. There is also archaeological evidence of Sunda Kingdom in West Java dating from the 2nd-century, and Jiwa Temple in Batujaya, Karawang, West Java was probably built around this time. South Indian culture was spread to Southeast Asia by the south Indian Pallava dynasty in the 4th and 5th centuries.[34] and by the 5th century, stone inscriptions written in Pallava scripts were found in Java and Borneo.\n\n\nA number of Hindu and Buddhist states flourished and then declined across Indonesia. Seven rough plinths dating from the beginning of the 4th century CE were found in Kutai, East Kalimantan, near the Mahakam River known as the Yupa inscription or \"Mulavarman Inscription\" believed to be one of the earliest Sanskrit inscriptions of Indonesia, the plinths were written by Brahmins in the Sanskrit language using the Pallava script of India recalling of a generous king by the name of Mulavarman who donated a huge amount of alms to Brahmin priests in his kingdom, the kingdom was known as the Kutai Martadipura Kingdom located in present East Kalimantan Province, believed to be the oldest and first Hindu kingdom of Indonesia.[35]\n\n\n\n* ![Indonesian burial mask, earlier than 5th century CE.](image)\n\nIndonesian burial mask, earlier than 5th century CE.\n* ![Standing warrior (spearman) bronze figure, Java, circa 500 BC–300 AD](image)\n\nStanding warrior (spearman) bronze figure, Java, circa 500 BC–300 AD\n* ![Standing warrior (swordsman) bronze figure, Java, circa 500 BC–300 AD.](image)\n\nStanding warrior (swordsman) bronze figure, Java, circa 500 BC–300 AD.\n\n\n### Tarumanagara and Sunda[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tarumanagara Kingdom and Sunda Kingdom\n\nOne such early kingdom was Tarumanagara, which flourished between 358 and 669 CE. Located in West Java close to modern-day Jakarta, its 5th-century king, Purnawarman, established the earliest known inscriptions in Java, the Ciaruteun inscription located near Bogor. And other inscriptions called the Pasir Awi inscription and the Muncul inscription. On this monument, King Purnawarman inscribed his name and made an imprint of his footprints, as well as his elephant's footprints. The accompanying inscription reads, \"Here are the footprints of King Purnavarman, the heroic conqueror of the world\". This inscription is written in Pallava script and in Sanskrit and is still clear after 1500 years. Purnawarman apparently built a canal that changed the course of the Cakung River, and drained a coastal area for agriculture and settlement purpose. In his stone inscriptions, Purnawarman associated himself with Vishnu, and Brahmins ritually secured the hydraulic project.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)8th century Borobudur Buddhist monument, Sailendra dynasty, is the largest Buddhist temple in the world.\nAround the same period, in the 6th to 7th centuries (501–700 CE), the Kalingga Kingdom was established in Central Java northern coast, mentioned in Chinese account.[37] The name of this kingdom was derived from ancient Indian kingdom of Kalinga, which suggest the ancient link between India and Indonesia.\n\n\nThe political history of Indonesian archipelago during the 7th to 11th (601–1100 CE) around centuries was dominated by Srivijaya based in Sumatra and Sailendra that dominated southeast Asia based in Java and constructed Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument in the world. The history prior of the 14th and 15th centuries (1301–1500 CE) is not well known due to the scarcity of evidence. By the 15th century (1401–1500 CE), two major states dominated this period; Majapahit in East Java, the greatest of the pre-Islamic Indonesian states, and Malacca on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, arguably one of the greatest of the Muslim trading empires,[38] this marked the rise of Muslim states in the Indonesian archipelago.\n\n\n\n### Mataram[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mataram Kingdom\n\n![](image)Prambanan in Java was built during the Sanjaya dynasty of Mataram Kingdom; it is one of the largest Hindu temple complexes in Southeast Asia.\nMataram Empire, sometimes referred to as Mataram Kingdom,[39] was an Indianized kingdom based in Central Java around modern-day Yogyakarta between the 8th and 10th centuries. The kingdom was ruled by the Sailendra dynasty, and later by the Sanjaya dynasty. The centre of the kingdom was moved from central Java to East Java by Mpu Sindok. An eruption of the volcano Mount Merapi in 929, and political pressure from Sailendrans based in the Srivijaya Empire may have caused the move.\n\n\nThe first king of Mataram, Sri Sanjaya, left inscriptions in stone.[40] The monumental Hindu temple of Prambanan in the vicinity of Yogyakarta was built by Pikatan. Dharmawangsa ordered the translation of the Mahabharata into Old Javanese in 996.\n\n\nIn the period 750 CE – 850 CE, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture. A rapid increase in temple construction occurred across the landscape of its heartland in Mataram (Kedu and Kewu Plain). The most notable temples constructed in Mataram are Kalasan, Sewu, Borobudur and Prambanan. The Empire had become the supreme power not only in Java but also over Srivijayan Empire, Bali, southern Thailand, some Philippine kingdoms, and Khmer in Cambodia.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sewu temple in Special Region of Yogyakarta\nLater in its history, the dynasty divided into two dynasties based on their own religion, the Buddhist and Shivaist dynasties. Civil war was unavoidable and the outcome was Mataram Empire divided into two powerful kingdom based on region and religion. The Shivaist dynasty of Mataram kingdom in Java led by Rakai Pikatan and the Buddhist dynasty of Srivijaya kingdom in Sumatra led by Balaputradewa. The hostility between them didn't end until in 1006 when the Sailendran based in Srivijaya kingdom incited rebellion by Wurawari, vassal of Mataram kingdom and sacked Shivaist dynasty's capital in Watugaluh, Java. Srivijaya kingdom rose into undisputed hegemonic Empire in the era as the result. Yet the Shivaist dynasty survived and successfully reclaimed the east Java in 1019 then descended to Kahuripan kingdom led by Airlangga son of Udayana of Bali.[42]\n\n\n\n### Sriwijaya[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Srivijaya\n\nSriwijaya was a kingdom on Sumatra which influenced much of the Maritime Southeast Asia. From the 7th century, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it.[43][44]\n\n\nSrivijaya was centred in the coastal trading centre of present-day Palembang. Srivijaya was not a \"state\" in the modern sense with defined boundaries and a centralised government to which the citizens own allegiance.[45] Rather Srivijaya was a confederacy form of society centred on a royal heartland.[45] It was a thalassocracy and did not extend its influence far beyond the coastal areas of the islands of Southeast Asia. Trade was the driving force of Srivijaya just as it is for most societies throughout history.[46] The Srivijayan navy controlled the trade that made its way through the Strait of Malacca.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe territory of the Srivijaya empire. Historically, Srivijaya was one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia.\n![](image)\nThe depiction of Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa, the first king of Srivijaya\n\nBy the 7th century, the harbours of various vassal states of Srivijaya lined both coasts of the Straits of Melaka.[46] Around this time, Srivijaya had established suzerainty over large areas of Sumatra, western Java, and much of the Malay Peninsula.[47] Dominating the Malacca and Sunda straits, the empire controlled both the Spice Route traffic and local trade.[47] It remained a formidable sea power until the 13th century.[47] This spread the ethnic Malay culture throughout Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and western Borneo.[48] A stronghold of Mahayana Buddhism, Srivijaya attracted pilgrims and scholars from other parts of Asia.[47]\n\n\nThe relation between Srivijaya and the Chola Empire of south India was friendly during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I but during the reign of Rajendra Chola I the Chola Empire attacked Srivijaya cities.[49] A series of Chola raids in the 11th century weakened the Srivijayan hegemony and enabled the formation of regional kingdoms based, like Kediri, on intensive agriculture rather than coastal and long-distance trade. Srivijayan influence waned by the 11th century. The island was in frequent conflict with the Javanese kingdoms, first Singhasari and then Majapahit. Islam eventually made its way to the Aceh region of Sumatra, spreading its influence through contacts with Arabs and Indian traders. By the late 13th century, the kingdom of Pasai in northern Sumatra converted to Islam. The last inscription dates to 1374, where a crown prince, Ananggavarman, is mentioned. Srivijaya ceased to exist by 1414, when Parameswara, the kingdom's last prince, fled to Temasik, then to Malacca. Later his son converted to Islam and founded the Sultanate of Malacca on the Malay peninsula.\n\n\n\n### Singhasari and Majapahit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nArchaeological remains in Trowulan, the capital city of the Majapahit\n\nMain articles: Singhasari and Majapahit\n\n![](image)\nExpansion of the Majapahit empire extended to much of the Indonesian archipelago until it receded and fell in the early 16th century.\nFile:Illustration of Gajah Mada.jpg\nModern illustration of Gajah Mada, a powerful military leader, credited with bringing the empire to its peak of glory\n\nMajapahit was the most dominant of Indonesia's pre-Islamic states.[38] The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada it experienced what is often referred to as a golden age in Indonesian history,[50] when its influence extended to much of southern Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and Bali[51] from about 1293 to around 1500.\n\n\nThe founder of the Majapahit Empire, Kertarajasa, was the son-in-law of the ruler of the Singhasari kingdom, also based in Java. After Singhasari drove Srivijaya out of Java in 1290, the rising power of Singhasari came to the attention of Kublai Khan in China and he sent emissaries demanding tribute. Kertanagara, ruler of the Singhasari kingdom, refused to pay tribute and the Khan sent a punitive expedition which arrived off the coast of Java in 1293. By that time, a rebel from Kediri, Jayakatwang, had killed Kertanagara. The Majapahit founder allied himself with the Mongols against Jayakatwang and, once the Singhasari kingdom was destroyed, turned and forced his Mongol allies to withdraw in confusion.\n\n\nGajah Mada, a Majapahit prime minister and regent from 1331 to 1364, extended the empire's rule to the surrounding islands. A few years after Gajah Mada's death, the Majapahit navy captured Palembang, putting an end to the Sriwijaya kingdom. Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that passed through the archipelago. About the time Majapahit was founded, Muslim traders and proselytisers began entering the area. After its peak in the 14th century, Majapahit power began to decline and was unable to control the rising power of the Sultanate of Malacca. Dates for the end of the Majapahit Empire range from 1478 to 1520. A large number of courtiers, artisans, priests, and members of the royal family moved east to the island of Bali at the end of Majapahit power.\n\n\n\n## The age of Islamic states[edit]\n\n\n### The spread of Islam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The spread of Islam in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Map of Indonesia; 1674–1745 by Khatib Çelebi, a geographer from the Ottoman Turks.\nThe earliest accounts of the Indonesian archipelago date from the Abbasid Caliphate, according to those early accounts the Indonesian archipelago were famous among early Muslim sailors mainly due to its abundance of precious spice trade commodities such as nutmeg, cloves, galangal and many other spices.[52]\n\n\nAlthough Muslim traders first travelled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era, the spread of Islam among the inhabitants of the Indonesian archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra.[53][54]\n\n\nAlthough it is known that the spread of Islam began in the west of the archipelago, the fragmentary evidence does not suggest a rolling wave of conversion through adjacent areas; rather, it suggests the process was complicated and slow.[53] The spread of Islam was driven by increasing trade links outside of the archipelago; in general, traders and the royalty of major kingdoms were the first to adopt the new religion.[55]\n\n\nOther Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam, making it the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 7th until 13th century.[3] For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java.[55] Only Bali retained a Hindu majority. In the eastern archipelago, both Christian and Islamic missionaries were active in the 16th and 17th centuries, and, currently, there are large communities of both religions on these islands.[55]\n\n\n\n### Sultanate of Mataram[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sultanate of Mataram\n\n![](image)Gate of Masjid Agung Kotagede Mosque\nThe Sultanate of Mataram was the third Sultanate in Java, after the Sultanate of Demak Bintoro and the Sultanate of Pajang.[56]\n\n\nAccording to Javanese records, Kyai Gedhe Pamanahan became the ruler of the Mataram area in the 1570s with the support of the kingdom of Pajang to the east, near the current site of Surakarta (Solo). Pamanahan was often referred to as Kyai Gedhe Mataram after his ascension.[57]\n\n\nPamanahan's son, Panembahan Senapati, replaced his father on the throne around 1584. Under Senapati the kingdom grew substantially through regular military campaigns against Mataram's neighbours. Shortly after his accession, for example, he conquered his father's patrons in Pajang.[56]\n\n\n\nThe reign of Panembahan Seda ing Krapyak (*c.* 1601–1613), the son of Senapati, was dominated by further warfare, especially against powerful Surabaya, already a major centre in East Java. The first contact between Mataram and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) occurred under Krapyak. Dutch activities at the time were limited to trading from limited coastal settlements, so their interactions with the inland Mataram kingdom were limited, although they did form an alliance against Surabaya in 1613. Krapyak died that year.[58]\n\n![](image)Ruins of the Sultanate of Banten Palace in 1859Krapyak was succeeded by his son, who is known simply as Sultan Agung (\"Great Sultan\") in Javanese records. Agung was responsible for the great expansion and lasting historical legacy of Mataram due to the extensive military conquests of his long reign from 1613 to 1646.\n\n\n### The Sultanate of Banten[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Sultanate of Banten\n\nIn 1524–25, Sunan Gunung Jati from Cirebon, together with the armies of Demak Sultanate, seized the port of Banten from the Sunda kingdom, and established The Sultanate of Banten. This was accompanied by Muslim preachers and the adoption of Islam amongst the local population. At its peak in the first half of the 17th century, the Sultanate lasted from 1526 to 1813 AD. The Sultanate left many archaeological remains and historical records.[59]\n\n\n\n## Colonial era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dutch settlement in the East Indies. Batavia (now Jakarta), Java, c. 1665 CE.\nBeginning in the 16th century, successive waves of Europeans—the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and English—sought to dominate the spice trade at its sources in India and the 'Spice Islands' (Maluku) of Indonesia. This meant finding a way to Asia to cut out Muslim merchants who, with their Venetian outlet in the Mediterranean, monopolised spice imports to Europe. Astronomically priced at the time, spices were highly coveted not only to preserve and make poorly preserved meat palatable, but also as medicines and magic potions.[60]\n\n\nThe arrival of Europeans in South East Asia is often regarded as the watershed moment in its history. Other scholars consider this view untenable,[61] arguing that European influence during the times of the early arrivals of the 16th and 17th centuries was limited in both area and depth. This is in part due to Europe not being the most advanced or dynamic area of the world in the early 15th century. Rather, the major expansionist force of this time was Islam; in 1453, for example, the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople, while Islam continued to spread through Indonesia and the Philippines. European influence, particularly that of the Dutch, would not have its greatest impact on Indonesia until the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n\n\n### The Portuguese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Portuguese colonialism in Indonesian history\n\n![](image)The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia's Banda Islands. Once one of the world's most valuable commodities, it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia.\nNew found Portuguese expertise in navigation, shipbuilding and weaponry allowed them to make daring expeditions of exploration and expansion. Starting with the first exploratory expeditions sent from newly conquered Malacca in 1512, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Indonesia, and sought to dominate the sources of valuable spices[62] and to extend the Catholic Church's missionary efforts. The Portuguese turned east to Maluku and through both military conquest and alliance with local rulers, they established trading posts, forts, and missions on the islands of Ternate, Ambon, and Solor among others. The height of Portuguese missionary activities, however, came in the latter half of the 16th century. Ultimately, the Portuguese presence in Indonesia was reduced to Solor, Flores and Timor in modern-day Nusa Tenggara, following defeat at the hands of indigenous Ternateans and the Dutch in Maluku, and a general failure to maintain control of trade in the region.[63] In comparison with the original Portuguese ambition to dominate Asian trade, their influence on Indonesian culture was small: the romantic *keroncong* guitar ballads; a number of Indonesian words which reflect Portuguese's role as the *lingua franca* of the archipelago alongside Malay; and many family names in eastern Indonesia such as da Costa, Dias, de Fretes, Gonsalves, etc. The most significant impacts of the Portuguese arrival were the disruption and disorganisation of the trade network mostly as a result of their conquest of Malacca, and the first significant plantings of Christianity in Indonesia. There have continued to be Christian communities in eastern Indonesia through to the present, which has contributed to a sense of shared interest with Europeans, particularly among the Ambonese.[64]\n\n\n\n### Dutch East-India Company[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dutch East India Company in Indonesia\n\n![](image)An early 18th-century Dutch map from a time when only the north coastal ports of Java were well known to the Dutch\nIn 1602, the Dutch parliament awarded the VOC a monopoly on trade and colonial activities in the region at a time before the company controlled any territory in Java. In 1619, the VOC conquered the West Javan city of Jayakarta, where they founded the city of Batavia (present-day Jakarta). The VOC became deeply involved in the internal politics of Java in this period, and fought in a number of wars involving the leaders of Mataram and Banten.\n\n\nThe Dutch followed the Portuguese aspirations, courage, brutality, and strategies but brought better organisation, weapons, ships, and superior financial backing. Although they failed to gain complete control of the Indonesian spice trade, they had much more success than the previous Portuguese efforts. They exploited the factionalisation of the small kingdoms in Java that had replaced Majapahit, establishing a permanent foothold in Java, from which grew a land-based colonial empire which became one of the richest colonial possessions on earth.[64]\n\n\nBy the mid-17th century, Batavia, the headquarter of VOC in Asia, had become an important trade centre in the region. It had repelled attacks from the Javanese Mataram kingdom. In 1641, the Dutch captured Malacca from the Portuguese, thus weakened Portuguese position in Asia. The Dutch defeated the Sulawesi city of Makassar in 1667 thus bringing its trade under VOC control. Sumatran ports were also brought under VOC control and the last of the Portuguese were expelled in 1660. In return for monopoly control over the pepper trade and the expulsion of the English, the Dutch helped the son of the ruler of Banten overthrow his father in 1680. By the 18th century, the VOC has established themselves firmly in Indonesian archipelago, controlling inter-island trade as part of their Asian business which includes India, Ceylon, Formosa, and Japan. VOC has established their important bases in some ports in Java, Maluku, and parts of Sulawesi, Sumatra, and Malay Peninsula.\n\n\n\n### French and British interlude[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French and British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)The Java Great Post Road, commissioned by Daendels\nAfter the fall of the Netherlands to the First French Empire and the dissolution of the Dutch East India Company in 1800, there were profound changes in the European colonial administration of the East Indies. The company's assets in East Indies were nationalised as the Dutch colony, the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, Europe was devastated by the Napoleonic Wars. In the Netherlands, Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806 oversaw the dissolution of the Batavian Republic, which was replaced by the Kingdom of Holland, a French puppet kingdom ruled by Napoleon's third brother Louis Bonaparte (Lodewijk Napoleon). The East Indies were treated as a proxy French colony, administered through a Dutch intermediary.\n\n\nIn 1806, King Lodewijk of the Netherlands sent one of his generals, Herman Willem Daendels, to serve as governor-general of the East Indies, based in Java. Daendels was sent to strengthen Javanese defences against a predicted British invasion. Since 1685, the British had had a presence in Bencoolen on the western coast of Sumatra, as well as several posts north of the Malaccan straits. Daendels was responsible for the construction of the Great Post Road (Indonesian: *Jalan Raya Pos*) across northern Java from Anjer to Panaroecan. The thousand-kilometre road was meant as to ease logistics across Java and was completed in only one year, during which thousands of Javanese forced labourers died.[65] In 1811, Java was captured by the British, becoming a possession of the British Empire, and Thomas Stamford Raffles was appointed as the island's governor. Raffles launched several military expeditions against local Javanese princes; such as the assault on Yogyakarta kraton on 21 June 1812, and the military expedition against Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II of Palembang, along with giving orders to seize the nearby Bangka Island.[66][67] During his administration, numbers of ancient monuments in Java were rediscovered, excavated and systematically catalogued for the first time, the most important one being the rediscovery of Borobudur Buddhist temple in Central Java.[68][69] Raffles was an enthusiast of the island's history, as he wrote the book History of Java published later in 1817. In 1815, the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the end of Napoleonic Wars, under the terms of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.[70]\n\n\n\n### Dutch state rule[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)Batavian (Jakarta) tea factory in the 1860s\nAfter the VOC was dissolved in 1800 following bankruptcy,[71] and after the end of British rule under Raffles' governorship, the Dutch state took over the VOC possessions in 1816. A Javanese uprising was crushed in the Java War of 1825–1830. After 1830, a system of forced cultivations and indentured labour was introduced on Java, the Cultivation System (in Dutch: *cultuurstelsel*). This system brought the Dutch and their Indonesian allies enormous wealth. The cultivation system tied peasants to their land, forcing them to work in government-owned plantations for 60 days of the year. The system was abolished in a more liberal period after 1870. In 1901, the Dutch adopted what they called the Ethical Policy, which included somewhat increased investment in indigenous education, and modest political reforms.\n\n\n\n![](image)Dutch imperial painting depicting the Dutch East Indies as \"our most precious gem\" (1916)\nThe Dutch colonials formed a privileged upper social class of soldiers, administrators, managers, teachers, and pioneers. They lived together with the \"natives\", but at the top of a rigid social and racial caste system.[72][73] The Dutch East Indies had two legal classes of citizens; European and indigenous. A third class, Foreign Easterners, was added in 1920.[74]\n\n\nUpgrading the infrastructure of ports and roads was a high priority for the Dutch, with the goal of modernising the economy, pumping wages into local areas, facilitating commerce, and speeding up military movements. By 1950, Dutch engineers had built and upgraded a road network with 12,000 km of asphalted surface, 41,000 km of metalled road area and 16,000 km of gravel surfaces.[75] In addition the Dutch built 7,500 kilometres (4,700 mi) of railways, bridges, irrigation systems covering 1.4 million hectares (5,400 sq mi) of rice fields, several harbours, and 140 public drinking water systems. These Dutch constructed public works became the economic base of the colonial state; after independence, they became the basis of the Indonesian infrastructure.[76]\n\n\nFor most of the colonial period, Dutch control over its territories in the Indonesian archipelago was tenuous. In some cases, Dutch police and military actions in parts of Indonesia were quite cruel. Recent discussions, for example, of Dutch cruelty in Aceh have encouraged renewed research on these aspects of Dutch rule.[77] It was only in the early 20th century, three centuries after the first Dutch trading post, that the full extent of the colonial territory was established and direct colonial rule exerted across what would become the boundaries of the modern Indonesian state.[78] Portuguese Timor, now East Timor, remained under Portuguese rule until 1975 when it was invaded by Indonesia. The Indonesian government declared the territory an Indonesian province but relinquished it in 1999.\n\n\n\n## The emergence of Indonesia[edit]\n\n\n### Indonesian National Awakening[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian National Awakening\n\n![](image)Sukarno, Indonesian Nationalist leader, and later, first president of Indonesia\nIn October 1908, the first nationalist movement was formed, Budi Utomo.[79] On 10 September 1912, the first nationalist mass movement was formed: Sarekat Islam.[80] By December 1912, Sarekat Islam had 93,000 members.[80] The Dutch responded after the First World War with repressive measures. The nationalist leaders came from a small group of young professionals and students, some of whom had been educated in the Netherlands. In the post–World War I era, the Indonesian communists who were associated with the Third International started to usurp the nationalist movement.[81] The repression of the nationalist movement led to many arrests, including Indonesia's first president, Sukarno (1901–70), who was imprisoned for political activities on 29 December 1929.[82] Also arrested was Mohammad Hatta, first vice-president of Indonesia.[83] Additionally, Sutan Sjahrir, who later became the first Prime Minister of Indonesia, was arrested on this date.[84]\n\n\nIn 1914 the exiled Dutch socialist Henk Sneevliet founded the Indies Social Democratic Association. Initially a small forum of Dutch socialists, it would later evolve into the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) in 1924.[85] In the post–World War I era, the Dutch strongly repressed all attempts at change. This repression led to a growth of the PKI. By December 1924, the PKI had a membership of 1,140.[85] One year later in 1925, the PKI had grown to 3,000 members.[85] From 1926 to 1927, there was a PKI-led revolt against Dutch colonialism and the harsh repression of strikes of urban workers.[86] However, the strikes and the revolt was put down by the Dutch with some 13,000 nationalists and communists leaders were arrested.[86] Some 4,500 were given prison sentences.[86]\n\n\nSukarno was released from prison in December 1931 [87] but was re-arrested on 1 August 1933.[88]\n\n\n\n### Japanese occupation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)Japanese bicycle infantry move through Java during their occupation of the Dutch East Indies.\nThe Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during World War II interrupted Dutch rule[89][90] and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. In May 1940, early in World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands, but the Dutch government-in-exile initially continued to control the Dutch East Indies from its base in London. The Dutch East Indies declared a state of siege and in July 1940 redirected exports intended for Japan to the US and Britain. Negotiations with the Japanese aimed at securing supplies of aviation fuel collapsed in June 1941, and the Japanese started their conquest of Southeast Asia in December of that year.[91] That same month, factions from Sumatra sought Japanese assistance for a revolt against the Dutch wartime government. The Japanese military defeated last Dutch forces in the East Indies in March 1942.\n\n\n\n![](image)Japanese commanders in the Dutch East Indies during the surrender\nIn July 1942, Sukarno accepted Japan's offer to rally the public in support of the Japanese war effort. Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta were decorated by the Emperor of Japan in 1943. However, experience of the Japanese occupation of Dutch East Indies varied considerably, depending upon where one lived and one's social position. Many who lived in areas considered important to the war effort experienced torture, sex slavery, arbitrary arrest and execution, and other war crimes. Thousands taken away from Indonesia as war labourers (romusha) suffered or died as a result of ill-treatment and starvation. People of Dutch and mixed Dutch-Indonesian descent were particular targets of the Japanese occupation.\n\n\nIn March 1945, the Japanese established the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK) as the initial stage of the establishment of independence for the area under the control of the Japanese 16th Army.[92] At its first meeting in May, Soepomo spoke of national integration and against personal individualism, while Muhammad Yamin suggested that the new nation should claim British Borneo, British Malaya, Portuguese Timor, and all the pre-war territories of the Dutch East Indies. The committee drafted the 1945 Constitution, which remains in force, though now much amended. On 9 August 1945 Sukarno, Hatta, and Radjiman Wediodiningrat were flown to meet Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi in Vietnam. They were told that Japan intended to announce Indonesian independence on 24 August. After the Japanese surrender, however, Sukarno unilaterally proclaimed Indonesian independence on 17 August. A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of the Japanese occupation.[93]\n\n\n\n### Indonesian National Revolution[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian National Revolution\n\n![](image)Indonesian flag raising shortly after the declaration of independence\nUnder pressure from radical and politicised *pemuda* ('youth') groups, Sukarno and Hatta on behalf of the Nation proclaimed Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945 from colonialism by foreign nations two days after the Japanese Emperor's surrender in the Pacific, and made this nation an independent state, which has the right to govern its people and nation in accordance with the philosophy, character and spirit of the Indonesia nation itself.[94] The following day, the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) declared Sukarno President and Hatta Vice-President.[95][96][97][98][99] Word of the proclamation spread by shortwave and fliers while the Indonesian war-time military (PETA), youths, and others rallied in support of the new republic, often moving to take over government offices from the Japanese. In December 1946 the United Nations acknowledged[100] that Netherlands had advised the United Nations that the \"Netherlands Indies\" was a non-self-governing territory (colony) for which the Netherlands had a legal duty to make yearly reports and to assist towards \"a full measure of self-government\" as required by the *Charter of the United Nations article 73*.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sukarno speaking at the *Rapat Akbar* (grand meeting) on 19 September 1945\nThe Dutch, initially backed by the British, tried to re-establish their rule,[101] and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure,[102] the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence.[97][101] Dutch efforts to re-establish complete control met resistance. At the end of World War II, a power vacuum arose, and the nationalists often succeeded in seizing the arms of the demoralised Japanese. A period of unrest with city guerrilla warfare called the Bersiap period ensued. Groups of Indonesian nationalists armed with improvised weapons (like bamboo spears) and firearms attacked returning Allied troops. 3,500 Europeans were killed and 20,000 were missing, meaning there were more European deaths in Indonesia after the war than during the war. After returning to Java, Dutch forces quickly re-occupied the colonial capital of Batavia (now Jakarta), so the city of Yogyakarta in central Java became the capital of the nationalist forces. Negotiations with the nationalists led to two major truce agreements, but disputes about their implementation, and much mutual provocation, led each time to renewed conflict. Within four years the Dutch had recaptured almost the whole of Indonesia, but guerrilla resistance persisted, led on Java by commander Nasution. On 27 December 1949, after four years of sporadic warfare and fierce criticism of the Dutch by the UN, the Netherlands officially recognised Indonesian sovereignty under the federal structure of the United States of Indonesia (RUSI). With the unification of all the kingdoms in the archipelago On 17 August 1950, exactly five years after the proclamation of independence, the last of the federal states were dissolved and Sukarno proclaimed a single unitary Republic of Indonesia until now.[103][94]\n\n\n\n## Sukarno's presidency[edit]\n\n\n### Democratic experiment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Liberal democracy period in Indonesia\n\n![](image)Campaign posters for the 1955 Indonesian election\nWith the unifying struggle to secure Indonesia's independence over, divisions in Indonesian society began to appear. These included regional differences in customs, religion, the impact of Christianity and Marxism, and fears of Javanese political domination. Following colonial rule, Japanese occupation, and war against the Dutch, the new country suffered from severe poverty, a ruinous economy, low educational and skills levels, and authoritarian traditions.[104][105] Challenges to the authority of the Republic included the militant *Darul Islam* who waged a guerrilla struggle against the Republic from 1948 to 1962; the declaration of an independent Republic of South Maluku by Ambonese formerly of the Royal Dutch Indies Army; and rebellions in Sumatra and Sulawesi between 1955 and 1961.\n\n\nIn contrast to the 1945 Constitution, the 1950 constitution mandated a parliamentary system of government, an executive responsible to parliament, and stipulated at length constitutional guarantees for human rights, drawing heavily on the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[106] A proliferation of political parties dealing for shares of cabinet seats resulted in a rapid turnover of coalition governments including 17 cabinets between 1945 and 1958. The long-postponed parliamentary elections were held in 1955; although the Indonesian National Party (PNI)—considered Sukarno's party—topped the poll, and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) received strong support, no party garnered more than a quarter of the votes, which resulted in short-lived coalitions.[105]\n\n\n\n### Guided Democracy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Guided Democracy in Indonesia\n\n![](image)National emblem of the Republic of Indonesia, adopted in 1950\nBy 1956, Sukarno was openly criticising parliamentary democracy, stating that it was \"based upon inherent conflict\" which ran counter to Indonesian notions of harmony as being the natural state of human relationships. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, under the guidance of village elders. He proposed a threefold blend of *nasionalisme* ('nationalism'), *agama* ('religion'), and *komunisme* ('communism') into a co-operative 'Nas-A-Kom' government. This was intended to appease the three main factions in Indonesian politics — the army, Islamic groups, and the communists. With the support of the military, he proclaimed in February 1957 a system of 'Guided Democracy', and proposed a cabinet representing all the political parties of importance (including the PKI).[105] The US tried and failed to secretly overthrow the president, even though Secretary of State Dulles declared before Congress that \"we are not interested in the internal affairs of this country.\"[107]\n\n\nSukarno abrogated the 1950 Constitution on 9 July 1959 by a decree dissolving the Constitutional Assembly and restoring the 1945 Constitution.[105] The elected parliament was replaced by one appointed by, and subject to the will of, the president. Another non-elected body, the Supreme Advisory Council, was the main policy development body, while the National Front was set up in September 1960 and presided over by the president to \"mobilise the revolutionary forces of the people\".[105] Western-style parliamentary democracy was thus finished in Indonesia until the 1999 elections of the *Reformasi* era.[105]\n\n\n\n### Sukarno's revolution and nationalism[edit]\n\n\nCharismatic Sukarno spoke as a romantic revolutionary, and under his increasingly authoritarian rule, Indonesia moved on a course of stormy nationalism. Sukarno was popularly referred to as *bang* (\"older brother\"), and he painted himself as a man of the people carrying the aspirations of Indonesia and one who dared take on the West.[108] He instigated a number of large, ideologically driven infrastructure projects and monuments celebrating Indonesia's identity, which were criticised as substitutes for real development in a deteriorating economy.[108]\n\n\nWestern New Guinea had been part of the Dutch East Indies, and Indonesian nationalists had thus claimed it on this basis. Indonesia was able to instigate a diplomatic and military confrontation with the Dutch over the territory following an Indonesian-Soviet arms agreement in 1960. It was, however, United States pressure on the Netherlands that led to an Indonesian takeover in 1963.[109] Also in 1963, Indonesia commenced *Konfrontasi* with the new state of Malaysia. The northern states of Borneo, formerly British Sarawak and Sabah, had wavered in joining Malaysia, whilst Indonesia saw itself as the rightful ruler of Austronesian peoples and supported an unsuccessful revolution attempt in Brunei.[109] Reviving the glories of the Indonesian National Revolution, Sukarno increased the anti-British sentiment in his rhetoric and mounted military offensives along the Indonesia-Malaysia border in Borneo. As the PKI rallied in Jakarta streets in support, the West became increasingly alarmed at Indonesian foreign policy and the United States withdrew its aid to Indonesia.[109]\n\n\nIn social policy, Sukarno's time in office witnessed substantial reforms in health and education,[110] together with the passage of various pro-labour measures.[111] However, Indonesia's economic position deteriorated under Sukarno; by the mid-1960s, the cash-strapped government had to scrap critical public sector subsidies, inflation was at 1,000%, export revenues were shrinking, infrastructure crumbling, and factories were operating at minimal capacity with negligible investment. Severe poverty and hunger were widespread.[109][112]\n\n\n\n## The New Order[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Order (Indonesia)\n\n### Transition to the New Order[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transition to the New Order\n\nSee also: 30 September Movement and Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66\n\n![](image)During the mid-20th century. It was the largest non-ruling communist party in the world before its eradication in 1965 and ban the following year.\nDescribed as the great *dalang* (\"puppet master\"), Sukarno's position depended on balancing the opposing and increasingly hostile forces of the army and the PKI. Sukarno's anti-imperialist ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on Soviet and then communist China. By 1965, the PKI was the largest communist party in the world outside the Soviet Union or China. Penetrating all levels of government, the party increasingly gained influence at the expense of the army.[113]\n\n\nOn 30 September 1965, six of the most senior generals within the military and other officers were assassinated in an attempted coup. The insurgents, known later as the 30 September Movement, backed a rival faction of the army and took up positions in the capital, later seizing control of the national radio station. They claimed they were acting against a plot organised by the generals to overthrow Sukarno. Within a few hours, Major General Suharto, commander of the Army Strategic Reserve (Kostrad), mobilised counteraction, and by the evening of 1 October, it was clear that the coup, which had little co-ordination and was largely limited to Jakarta, had failed. Complicated and partisan theories continue to this day over the identity of the attempted coup's organisers and their aims. According to the Indonesian army, the PKI were behind the coup and used disgruntled army officers to carry it out, and this became the official account of Suharto's subsequent New Order administration. Although there is not broad agreement on who bears ultimate responsibility for the coup or even if there was really a single mastermind controlling all events, modern evidence has suggested at least a role played by Western intelligence agencies including the American Central Intelligence Agency[114][115] and the United Kingdom's MI6.[116]\n\n\nThe PKI was blamed for the coup, and anti-communists, initially following the army's lead, went on a violent anti-communist purge across much of the country. The PKI was effectively destroyed,[117][118][119] and the most widely accepted estimates are that between 500,000 and 1 million were killed.[120][121][122] The violence was especially brutal in Java and Bali. The PKI was outlawed and possibly more than 1 million of its leaders and affiliates were imprisoned.[122] The United States and other Western powers facilitated and supported the purge.[123][124][125]\n\n\nThroughout the 1965–66 period, President Sukarno attempted to restore his political position and shift the country back to its pre-October 1965 position but his Guided Democracy balancing act was destroyed with the PKI's demise. Although he remained president, the weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who by that time had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS) named General Suharto acting president. Suharto was formally appointed president in March 1968. Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970.\n\n\n\n### Consolidation of the New Order[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Suharto was the military president of Indonesia from 1967 to 1998.\nIn the aftermath of Suharto's rise, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or imprisoned by the military and religious groups in a backlash against alleged communist supporters, with direct support from the United States.[126][127] Suharto's administration is commonly called the *New Order* era.[128] Suharto invited major foreign investment, which produced substantial, if uneven, economic growth. However, Suharto enriched himself and his family through business dealings and widespread corruption.[129]\n\n\n\n### Annexation of West Irian[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Western New Guinea Dispute and Operation Trikora\n\nAt the time of independence, the Dutch retained control over the western half of New Guinea (also known as West Irian), and permitted steps towards self-government and a declaration of independence on 1 December 1961. After negotiations with the Dutch on the incorporation of the territory into Indonesia failed, an Indonesian paratroop invasion 18 December preceded armed clashes between Indonesian and Dutch troops in 1961 and 1962. In 1962 the United States pressured the Netherlands into secret talks with Indonesia which in August 1962 produced the New York Agreement, and Indonesia assumed administrative responsibility for West Irian on 1 May 1963.\n\n\nRejecting UN supervision, the Indonesian government under Suharto decided to settle the question of West Irian, the former Dutch New Guinea, in their favour. Rather than a referendum of all residents of West Irian as had been agreed under Sukarno, an 'Act of Free Choice' was conducted in 1969 in which 1,025 Papuan representatives of local councils were selected by the Indonesians. They were warned to vote in favour of Indonesian integration with the group unanimously voting for integration with Indonesia.[130] A subsequent UN General Assembly resolution confirmed the transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia.\n\n\nWest Irian was renamed Irian Jaya ('glorious Irian') in 1973. Opposition to Indonesian administration of Irian Jaya (later known as Papua) gave rise to guerrilla activity in the years following Jakarta's assumption of control.\n\n\n\n### Annexation of East Timor[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian occupation of East Timor\n\n![](image)Timorese women with the Indonesian national flag\nIn 1975, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal caused authorities there to announce plans for decolonisation of Portuguese Timor, the eastern half of the island of Timor whose western half was a part of the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara. In the East Timorese elections held in 1975, Fretilin, a left-leaning party, and UDT, aligned with the local elite, emerged as the largest parties, having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence from Portugal. Apodeti, a party advocating integration with Indonesia, enjoyed little popular support.\n\n\nIndonesia alleged that Fretilin was communist, and feared that an independent East Timor would influence separatism in the archipelago. Indonesian military intelligence influenced the break-up of the alliance between Fretilin and UDT, which led to a coup by the UDT on 11 August 1975 and the start of a month-long civil war. During this time, the Portuguese government effectively abandoned the territory and did not resume the decolonisation process. On 28 November, Fretilin unilaterally declared independence, and proclaimed the 'Democratic Republic of East Timor'. Nine days later, on 7 December, Indonesia invaded East Timor, eventually annexing the tiny country of (then) 680,000 people. Indonesia was supported materially and diplomatically by the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, who regarded Indonesia as an anti-communist ally.\n\n\nFollowing the 1998 resignation of Suharto, the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence in a UN-sponsored referendum held on 30 August 1999. About 99% of the eligible population participated; more than three quarters chose independence despite months of attacks by the Indonesian military and its militia. After the result was announced, elements of the Indonesian military and its militia retaliated by killing approximately 2,000 East Timorese, displacing two-thirds of the population, raping hundreds of women and girls, and destroying much of the country's infrastructure. In October 1999, the Indonesian parliament (MPR) revoked the decree that annexed East Timor, and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) assumed responsibility for governing East Timor until it officially became an independent state in May 2002.\n\n\n\n### Transmigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transmigration program\n\nThe Transmigration program (*Transmigrasi*) was a National Government initiative to move landless people from densely populated areas of Indonesia (such as Java and Bali) to less populous areas of the country including Papua, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi. The stated purpose of this program was to reduce the considerable poverty and overpopulation on Java, to provide opportunities for hard-working poor people, and to provide a workforce to better utilise the resources of the outer islands. The program, however, has been controversial, with critics accusing the Indonesian Government of trying to use these migrants to reduce the proportion of native populations in destination areas to weaken separatist movements. The program has often been cited as a major and ongoing factor in controversies and even conflict and violence between settlers and indigenous populations.\n\n\n\n## Reform Era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Post-Suharto era\n\nSee also: Indonesian Revolution of 1998\n\n### Pro-democracy movement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University students and police forces clash in May 1998\nIn 1996, Suharto undertook efforts to pre-empt a challenge to the New Order government. The Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), a legal party that had traditionally propped up the regime, had changed direction and began to assert its independence. Suharto fostered a split over the leadership of PDI, backing a co-opted faction loyal to deputy speaker of the People's Representative Council Suryadi against a faction loyal to Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Sukarno and the PDI's chairperson.\n\n\nAfter the Suryadi faction announced a party congress to sack Megawati would be held in Medan on 20–22 June, Megawati proclaimed that her supporters would hold demonstrations in protest. The Suryadi faction went through with its sacking of Megawati, and the demonstrations manifested themselves throughout Indonesia. This led to several confrontations on the streets between protesters and security forces, and recriminations over the violence. The protests culminated in the military allowing Megawati's supporters to take over PDI headquarters in Jakarta, with a pledge of no further demonstrations.\n\n\nSuharto allowed the occupation of PDI headquarters to go on for almost a month, as attentions were also on Jakarta due to a set of high-profile ASEAN meetings scheduled to take place there. Capitalizing on this, Megawati supporters organised \"democracy forums\" with several speakers at the site. On 26 July, officers of the military, Suryadi, and Suharto openly aired their disgust with the forums.[131]\n\n\nOn 27 July, police, soldiers, and persons claiming to be Suryadi supporters stormed the headquarters. Several Megawati supporters were killed, and over two hundred people were arrested and tried under the Anti-Subversion and Hate-Spreading laws. The day would become known as \"Black Saturday\" and mark the beginning of a renewed crackdown by the New Order government against supporters of democracy, now called the \"Reformasi\" or Reform movement.[132]\n\n\n\n### Economic crisis and Suharto's resignation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fall of Suharto\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis,[133] which had dire consequences for the Indonesian economy and society, as well as Suharto's presidency. At the same time, the country suffered a severe drought and some of the largest forest fires in history burned in Kalimantan and Sumatra. The rupiah, the Indonesian currency, took a sharp dive in value. Suharto came under scrutiny from international lending institutions, chiefly the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United States, over longtime embezzlement of funds and some protectionist policies. In December, Suharto's government signed a letter of intent to the IMF, pledging to enact austerity measures, including cuts to public services and removal of subsidies, in return for aid from the IMF and other donors. Prices for goods such as kerosene and rice, as well as fees for public services including education, rose dramatically. The effects were exacerbated by widespread corruption. The austerity measures approved by Suharto had started to erode domestic confidence with the New Order[134] and led to popular protests.\n\n\nSuharto stood for re-election by parliament for the seventh time in March 1998, justifying it on the grounds of the necessity of his leadership during the crisis. The parliament approved a new term. This sparked protests and riots throughout the country, now termed the Indonesian 1998 Revolution. Dissent within the ranks of his own Golkar party and the military finally weakened Suharto, and on 21 May he stood down from power.[135] He was replaced by his deputy, Vice President B.J. Habibie.\n\n\nPresident Habibie quickly assembled a cabinet. One of its main tasks was to re-establish International Monetary Fund and donor community support for an economic stabilisation program. He moved quickly to release political prisoners and lift some controls on freedom of speech and association. Elections for the national, provincial, and sub-provincial parliaments were held on 7 June 1999. In the elections for the national parliament, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P, led by Sukarno's daughter Megawati Sukarnoputri) won 34% of the vote; Golkar (Suharto's party, formerly the only legal party of government) 22%; United Development Party (PPP, led by Hamzah Haz) 12%; and National Awakening Party (PKB, led by Abdurrahman Wahid) 10%.\n\n\n\n\n### May 1998 riots of Indonesia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: May 1998 riots of Indonesia\n\nThe May 1998 riots of Indonesia also known as the 1998 tragedy or simply the 1998 event, were incidents of mass violence, demonstrations, and civil unrest of a racial nature that occurred throughout Indonesia.\n\n\n\n### Politics since 1999[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Indonesian 2009 election ballot. Since 2004, Indonesians are able to vote their president directly.\nIn October 1999, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), which consists of the 500-member Parliament plus 200 appointed members, elected Abdurrahman Wahid, commonly referred to as \"Gus Dur\", as President, and Megawati Sukarnoputri as Vice-President, both for five-year terms. Wahid named his first Cabinet in early November 1999 and a reshuffled, second Cabinet in August 2000. President Wahid's government continued to pursue democratisation and to encourage renewed economic growth under challenging conditions. In addition to continuing economic malaise, his government faced regional, interethnic, and interreligious conflict, particularly in Aceh, the Maluku Islands, and Irian Jaya. In West Timor, the problems of displaced East Timorese and violence by pro-Indonesian East Timorese militias caused considerable humanitarian and social problems. An increasingly assertive Parliament frequently challenged President Wahid's policies and prerogatives, contributing to a lively and sometimes rancorous national political debate.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the People's Consultative Assembly's first annual session in August 2000, President Wahid gave an account of his government's performance. On 29 January 2001, thousands of student protesters stormed parliament grounds and demanded that President Abdurrahman Wahid resign due to alleged involvement in corruption scandals. Under pressure from the Assembly to improve management and co-ordination within the government, he issued a presidential decree giving Vice-President Megawati control over the day-to-day administration of government. Soon after, Megawati Sukarnoputri assumed the presidency on 23 July. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won Indonesia's first direct presidential election in 2004,[136] and was reelected in 2009.[137]\n\n\nJoko Widodo, the PDI-P candidate, was elected president in 2014. Having previously served as the Governor of Jakarta, he is the first Indonesian president without a high-ranking political or military background.[138] However, his opponent Prabowo Subianto disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed.[139] Jokowi was reelected in 2019, again defeating Prabowo Subianto.\n\n\n\n### Terrorism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Terrorism in Indonesia\n\nAs a multi-ethnic and multicultural democratic country with a Muslim-majority population, Indonesia faces the challenge of dealing with terrorism linked to global militant Islamic movements. Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), a militant Islamic organisation that aspires for the establishment of a Daulah Islamiyah[140] across Southeast Asia, is responsible for a series of terrorist attacks in Indonesia. This terrorist organisation, linked to Al-Qaeda, was responsible for the Bali bombings in 2002 and 2005, as well as Jakarta bombings in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The Indonesian government and authorities have tried to crack down on terrorist cells in Indonesia.\n\n\nOn 14 January 2016, suicide bombers and gunmen initiated a terror attack in Jakarta, resulting in the death of eight people: three Indonesian civilians, a Canadian and four of the attackers. Twenty people were wounded during the attack. The Islamic state claimed responsibility for the incident.\n\n\n\n### Tsunami disaster and Aceh peace deal[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Indonesia\n\nOn 26 December 2004, a massive earthquake and tsunami devastated parts of northern Sumatra, particularly Aceh. Partly as a result of the need for co-operation and peace during the recovery from the tsunami in Aceh, peace talks between the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) were restarted. Accords signed in Helsinki created a framework for military de-escalation in which the government has reduced its military presence, as members of GAM's armed wing decommission their weapons and apply for amnesty. The agreement also allows for local parties to be established, and other autonomy measures.\n\n\n\n### Forest and plantation fires[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Southeast Asian haze, 1997 Southeast Asian haze, and 2015 Southeast Asian haze\n\nSince 1997 Indonesia has been struggling to contain forest fires, especially on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan. Haze occurs annually during the dry season and is largely caused by illegal agricultural fires due to slash-and-burn practices in Indonesia, especially in the provinces of South Sumatra and Riau on Indonesia's Sumatra island, and Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo.[141][142][143] The haze that occurred in 1997 was one of the most severe; dense hazes occurred again in 2005, 2006, 2009, 2013, and the worst was in 2015, killing dozens of Indonesians as a result of respiratory illnesses and road accidents due to poor visibility. Another 10 people were killed due to smog from forest and land fires.[144][145][146][147][148]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Indonesia ratified the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, becoming the last ASEAN country to do so.[149]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n\n\n* Foreign relations of Indonesia\n* History of Southeast Asia\n* List of presidents of Indonesia\n* Politics of Indonesia\n\n\nMuseums\n\n* Jakarta History Museum\n* National Museum of Indonesia\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Burhanudin, Jajat, and Kees van Dijk, eds. *Islam in Indonesia: Contrasting Images and Interpretations* (Amsterdam University Press, distributed by University of Chicago Press; 2013) 279 pages; scholarly articles\n* Dijk, Kees van. 2001. *A country in despair.

1947[1] is shared with that of Afghanistan, India, and Iran. Spanning the western expanse of the Indian subcontinent and the eastern borderlands of the Iranian plateau, the region of present-day Pakistan served both as the fertile ground of a major civilization and as the gateway of South Asia to Central Asia and the Near East.[2][3]\n\n\nSituated on the first coastal migration route of *Homo sapiens* out of Africa, the region was inhabited early by modern humans.[4][5] The 9,000-year history of village life in South Asia traces back to the Neolithic (7000–4300 BCE) site of Mehrgarh in Pakistan,[6][7][8] and the 5,000-year history of urban life in South Asia to the various sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, including Mohenjo Daro and Harappa.[9][10]\n\n\nFollowing the decline of the Indus valley civilization, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration in the Vedic Period (1500–500 BCE), bringing with them came their distinctive religious traditions and practices which fused with local culture.[11] The Indo-Aryans religious beliefs and practices from the Bactria–Margiana culture and the native Harappan Indus beliefs of the former Indus Valley Civilisation eventually gave rise to Vedic culture and tribes.[12][note 1] Most notable among them was Gandhara civilization, which flourished at the crossroads of India, Central Asia, and the Middle East, connecting trade routes and absorbing cultural influences from diverse civilizations.[14] The initial early Vedic culture was a tribal, pastoral society centred in the Indus Valley, of what is today Pakistan. During this period the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, were composed.[note 2]\n\n\nThe ensuing millennia saw the region of present-day Pakistan absorb many influences—represented among others in the ancient, mainly Hindu-Buddhist, sites of Taxila, and Takht-i-Bahi, the 14th-century Islamic-Sindhi monuments of Thatta, and the 17th-century Mughal monuments of Lahore. In the first half of the 19th century, the region was appropriated by the East India Company, followed, after 1857, by 90 years of direct British rule, and ending with the creation of Pakistan in 1947, through the efforts, among others, of its future national poet Allama Iqbal and its founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Since then, the country has experienced both civilian-democratic and military rule, resulting in periods of significant economic and military growth as well as those of instability; significant during the latter, was the secession of East Pakistan as the new nation of Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n\n## History by region[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Timeline of Pakistani history\n\n* History of Azad Jammu & Kashmir\n* History of Balochistan\n* History of East Pakistan\n* History of Gilgit-Baltistan\n* History of Islamabad Capital Territory\n* History of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n* History of Punjab\n* History of Sindh\n\n## Prehistory[edit]\n\n\n### Paleolithic period[edit]\n\n\nFile:Cave Paintings Tharia.jpgHumped bulls in the Tharia Cave Paintings, Balochistan, Pakistan\nThe Soanian is archaeological culture of the Lower Paleolithic, Acheulean. It is named after the Soan Valley in the Sivalik Hills, near modern-day Islamabad and is dated between c.774,000 and c.11,700 BCE.[16]\n\n\n\n### Neolithic period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mehrgarh\n\nMehrgarh is an important neolithic site discovered in 1974, which shows early evidence of farming and herding,[17] and dentistry.[18] The site dates back to 7000–5500 BCE and is located on the Kachi Plain of Balochistan. The residents of Mehrgarh lived in mud brick houses, stored grain in granaries, fashioned tools from copper, cultivated barley, wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. As the civilization progressed (5500–2600 BCE) residents began to engage in crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metalworking. The site was occupied continuously until 2600 BCE,[19] when climatic changes began to occur. Between 2600 and 2000 BCE, region became more arid and Mehrgarh was abandoned in favor of the Indus Valley,[20] where a new civilization was in the early stages of development.[21]\n\n\n\n## Bronze age[edit]\n\n\n### Indus Valley Civilisation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indus Valley Civilisation\n\nIndus Valley Civilization\n![](image)\nThe \"Priest King\" sculpture is carved from steatite.\n![](image)\nThe *Pashupati seal*\n![](image)\nThe Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-daro\n![](image)\nExcavated ruins of the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro in Sindh\n\n![](image)Indus Valley Civilisation\nThe Bronze Age in the Indus Valley began around 3300 BCE with the Indus Valley Civilization.[22] Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early civilizations of the Old World, and of the three the most widespread,[23] covering an area of 1.25 million km2.[24] It flourished in the basins of the Indus River, in what is today the Pakistani provinces of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan, and along a system of perennial, mostly monsoon-fed, rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the seasonal Ghaggar-Hakra River in parts of north-west India.[22] At its peak, the civilization hosted a population of approximately 5 million spread across hundreds of settlements extending as far as the Arabian Sea to present-day southern and eastern Afghanistan, and the Himalayas.[25] Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley, the Harappans, developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft (carneol products, seal carving), and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin.\n\n\nThe Mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilisation in the Indus Valley. The civilisation included urban centres such as Harappa, Ganeriwala and Mohenjo-daro as well as an offshoot called the Kulli culture (2500–2000 BCE) in southern Balochistan and was noted for its cities built of brick, roadside drainage system, and multi-storeyed houses. It is thought to have had some kind of municipal organisation as well.\n\n\nDuring the late period of this civilisation, signs of a gradual decline began to emerge, and by around 1700 BCE, most of the cities were abandoned. However, the Indus Valley Civilisation did not disappear suddenly, and some elements of the Indus Civilisation may have survived. Aridification of this region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial spur for the urbanisation associated with the civilisation, but eventually also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise, and to scatter its population eastward. The civilization collapsed around 1700 BCE, though the reasons behind its fall are still unknown. Through the excavation of the Indus cities and analysis of town planning and seals, it has been inferred that the Civilization had high level of sophistication in its town planning, arts, crafts, and trade.[26]\n\n\n\n## Early history – Iron Age[edit]\n\n\n### Vedic period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Vedic period, Indo-Aryan Migration, Indo-Aryans, and Vedas\n\nFurther information: Sintashta culture\n\n![](image)Archaeological cultures. The GGC, Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with Indo-Aryans.\nThe Vedic Period (c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE) is postulated to have formed during the 1500 BCE to 800 BCE. As Indo-Aryans migrated and settled into the Indus Valley, along with them came their distinctive religious traditions and practices which fused with local culture.[11] The Indo-Aryans religious beliefs and practices from the Bactria–Margiana Culture and the native Harappan Indus beliefs of the former Indus Valley Civilisation eventually gave rise to Vedic culture and tribes.[27][note 3] Early Indo-Aryans were a Late Bronze Age society centred in the Punjab, organised into tribes rather than kingdoms, and primarily sustained by a pastoral way of life. During this period the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, were composed.[note 4]\n\n\n\n## Ancient history[edit]\n\n\n### Achaemenid Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Achaemenid invasion of the Indus Valley\n\n![](image)Much of the area corresponding to modern-day Pakistan was subordinated to the Achaemenid Empire and forced to pay tributes to Persia.\n![](image)Ruins at Bhir Mound representing the city of Taxila during the Achaemenid period\nThe main Vedic tribes remaining in the Indus Valley by 550 BC were the *Kamboja*, *Sindhu*, *Taksas* of Gandhara, the *Madras* and *Kathas* of the River Chenab, *Mallas* of the River Ravi and *Tugras* of the River Sutlej. These several tribes and principalities fought against one another to such an extent that the Indus Valley no longer had one powerful Vedic tribal kingdom to defend against outsiders and to wield the warring tribes into one organized kingdom. King Pushkarasarin of Gandhara was engaged in power struggles against his local rivals and as such the Khyber Pass remained poorly defended. King Darius I of the Achaemenid Empire took advantage of the opportunity and planned for an invasion. The Indus Valley was fabled in Persia for its gold and fertile soil and conquering it had been a major objective of his predecessor Cyrus The Great.[28] In 542 BC, Cyrus had led his army and conquered the Makran coast in southern Balochistan. However, he is known to have campaigned beyond Makran (in the regions of Kalat, Khuzdar and Panjgur) and lost most of his army in the *Gedrosian Desert* (speculated today as the Kharan Desert).\n\n\nIn 518 BC, Darius led his army through the Khyber Pass and southwards in stages, eventually reaching the Arabian Sea coast in Sindh by 516 BC. Under Persian rule, a system of centralized administration, with a bureaucratic system, was introduced into the Indus Valley for the first time, establishing several satrapies: Gandāra around the general region of Gandhara, Hindush around Punjab and Sindh, Arachosia, encompassing parts of present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan,[29] Sattagydia around the Bannu basin,[30] and Gedrosia covering much of the Makran region of southern Balochistan.[31]\n\n\nWhat is known about the easternmost satraps and borderlands of the Achaemenid Empire is alluded to in the Darius inscriptions and from Greek sources such as the *Histories* of Herodotus and the later *Alexander Chronicles* (Arrian, Strabo et al.). These sources list three Indus Valley tributaries or conquered territories that were subordinated to the Persian Empire and made to pay tributes to the Persian Kings.[30]\n\n\n\n### Macedonian Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indian campaign of Alexander the Great and Macedonian Empire\n\n![](image)Alexander's campaigns in modern-day Pakistan\n![](image)Porus, with Alexander the Great\nBy spring of 326 BC, Alexander began on his Indus expedition from Bactria, leaving behind 3500 horses and 10,000 soldiers. He divided his army into two groups. The larger force would enter the Indus Valley through the Khyber Pass, just as Darius had done 200 years earlier, while a smaller force under the personal command of Alexander entered through a northern route, possibly through Broghol or Dorah Pass near Chitral. Alexander was commanding a group of shield-bearing guards, foot-companions, archers, Agrianians, and horse-javelin-men and led them against the tribes of the former Gandhara satrapy.\n\n\nThe first tribe they encountered were the Aspasioi tribe of the Kunar Valley, who initiated a fierce battle against Alexander, in which he himself was wounded in the shoulder by a dart. However, the Aspasioi eventually lost and 40,000 people were enslaved. Alexander then continued in a southwestern direction where he encountered the Assakenoi tribe of the Swat & Buner valleys in April 326 BC. The Assakenoi fought bravely and offered stubborn resistance to Alexander and his army in the cities of Ora, Bazira (Barikot) and Massaga. So enraged was Alexander about the resistance put up by the Assakenoi that he killed the entire population of Massaga and reduced its buildings to rubble – similar slaughters followed in Ora.[32] A similar slaughter then followed at Ora, another stronghold of the Assakenoi. The stories of these slaughters reached numerous Assakenians, who began fleeing to Aornos, a hill-fort located between Shangla and Kohistan. Alexander followed close behind their heels and besieged the strategic hill-fort, eventually capturing and destroying the fort and killing everyone inside. The remaining smaller tribes either surrendered or like the Astanenoi tribe of Pushkalavati (Charsadda) were quickly neutralized where 38,000 soldiers and 230,000 oxen were captured by Alexander.[33] Eventually Alexander's smaller force would meet with the larger force which had come through the Khyber Pass met at Attock. With the conquest of Gandhara complete, Alexander switched to strengthening his military supply line, which by now stretched dangerously vulnerable over the Hindu Kush back to Balkh in Bactria.\n\n\nAfter conquering Gandhara and solidifying his supply line back to Bactria, Alexander combined his forces with the King Ambhi of Taxila and crossed the River Indus in July 326 BC to begin the Archosia (Punjab) campaign. His first resistance would come at the River Jhelum near Bhera against King Porus of the Paurava tribe. The famous Battle of the Hydaspes (Jhelum) between Alexander (with Ambhi) and Porus would be the last major battle fought by him. After defeating Porus, his battle weary troops refused to advance into India[34] to engage the army of Nanda Dynasty and its vanguard of trampling elephants. Alexander, therefore proceeded south-west along the Indus Valley.[35] Along the way, he engaged in several battles with smaller kingdoms in Multan and Sindh, before marching his army westward across the Makran desert towards what is now Iran. In crossing the desert, Alexander's army took enormous casualties from hunger and thirst, but fought no human enemy. They encountered the \"Fish Eaters\", or Ichthyophagi, primitive people who lived on the Makran coast, who had matted hair, no fire, no metal, no clothes, lived in huts made of whale bones, and ate raw seafood.\n\n\n\n### Mauryan Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Maurya Empire, Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and Greco-Buddhism\n\n![](image)Territories of the Maurya Empire conceptualized as core areas or linear networks separated by large autonomous regions.\nThe Maurya Empire was a geographically extensive Iron Age historical power in South Asia based in Magadha, having been founded by Chandragupta Maurya in 322 BCE, and existing in loose-knit fashion until 185 BCE.[36] The Maurya Empire was centralized by the conquest of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and its capital city was located at Pataliputra (modern Patna). Outside this imperial center, the empire's geographical extent was dependent on the loyalty of military commanders who controlled the armed cities sprinkling it.[37][38][39] During Ashoka's rule (ca. 268–232 BCE) the empire briefly controlled the major urban hubs and arteries of the Indian subcontinent excepting the deep south.[36] It declined for about 50 years after Ashoka's rule, and dissolved in 185 BCE with the assassination of Brihadratha by Pushyamitra Shunga and foundation of the Shunga Empire in Magadha.\n\n\nChandragupta Maurya raised an army, with the assistance of Chanakya, author of Arthasastra,[40] and overthrew the Nanda Empire in c. 322 BCE. Chandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India by conquering the satraps left by Alexander the Great, and by 317 BCE the empire had fully occupied northwestern India.[41] The Mauryan Empire then defeated Seleucus I, a diadochus and founder of the Seleucid Empire, during the Seleucid–Mauryan war, thus acquiring territory west of the Indus River.[42][43]\n\n\nUnder the Mauryas, internal and external trade, agriculture, and economic activities thrived and expanded across South Asia due to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance, administration, and security. The Maurya dynasty built a precursor of the Grand Trunk Road from Patliputra to Taxila.[44] After the Kalinga War, the Empire experienced nearly half a century of centralized rule under Ashoka. Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism and sponsorship of Buddhist missionaries allowed for the expansion of that faith into Sri Lanka, northwest India, and Central Asia.[45]\n\n\nThe population of South Asia during the Mauryan period has been estimated to be between 15 and 30 million.[46] \nThe empire's period of dominion was marked by exceptional creativity in art, architecture, inscriptions and produced texts.[47]\n\n\n\n## Classical history – Middle Kingdoms[edit]\n\n\n### Indo-Greek Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indo-Greek Kingdom, Greco-Buddhist art, and Indo-Greek art\n\n![](image)Territory of the Indo-Greeks, circa 150 BC[48]\n![](image)Greco-Buddhist representation of the Buddha, seated to the left of a depiction of Vajrapani in the guise of the Hellenic god Heracles[49]\nThe Indo-Greek Menander I (reigned 155–130 BCE) drove the Greco-Bactrians out of Gandhara and beyond the Hindu Kush, becoming king shortly after his victory. His territories covered Panjshir and Kapisa in modern Afghanistan and extended to the Punjab region, with many tributaries to the south and east, possibly as far as Mathura. The capital Sagala (modern Sialkot) prospered greatly under Menander's rule and Menander is one of the few Bactrian kings mentioned by Greek authors.[50]\n\n\nThe classical Buddhist text Milinda Pañha praises Menander, saying there was \"none equal to Milinda in all India\".[51] His empire survived him in a fragmented manner until the last independent Greek king, Strato II, disappeared around 10 CE. Around 125 BCE, the Greco-Bactrian king Heliocles, son of Eucratides, fled from the Yuezhi invasion of Bactria and relocated to Gandhara, pushing the Indo-Greeks east of the Jhelum River. The last known Indo-Greek ruler was Theodamas, from the Bajaur area of Gandhara, mentioned on a 1st-century CE signet ring, bearing the Kharoṣṭhī inscription *\"Su Theodamasa\"* (*\"Su\"* was the Greek transliteration of the Kushan royal title *\"Shau\"* (\"Shah\" or \"King\")). Various petty kings ruled into the early 1st century CE, until the conquests by the Scythians, Parthians and the Yuezhi, who founded the Kushan dynasty.\n\n\nIt is during this period that the fusion of Hellenistic and Asiatic mythological, artistic and religious elements becomes most apparent, especially in the region of Gandhara, straddling western Pakistan and southern Afghanistan. Detailed, humanistic representations of the Buddha begin to emerge, depicting the figure with a close resemblance to the Hellenic god Apollo; Greek mythological motifs such as centaurs, Bacchanalian scenes, Nereids and deities such as Tyche and Heracles are prominent in the Buddhistic art of ancient Pakistan and Afghanistan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Indo-Scythian Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A stone palette of the type found in the Early Saka layer at Sirkap, Punjab\n![](image)Territories and expansion of the Indo-Scythians at their greatest extent, including territories of the Northern Satraps and Western Satraps.\nThe Indo-Scythians were descended from the Sakas (Scythians) who migrated from southern Central Asia into Pakistan and Arachosia from the middle of the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE. They displaced the Indo-Greeks and ruled a kingdom that stretched from Gandhara to Mathura. The power of the Saka rulers started to decline in the 2nd century CE after the Scythians were defeated by the south Indian Emperor Gautamiputra Satakarni of the Satavahana dynasty.[52][53] Later the Saka kingdom was completely destroyed by Chandragupta II of the Gupta Empire from eastern India in the 4th century.[54]\n\n\n\n### Indo-Parthian Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Apracharajas and Paratarajas\n\n![](image)Ancient Buddhist monastery Takht-i-Bahi (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) constructed by the Indo-Parthians\n![](image)Indo-Parthian Kingdom at its maximum extent, circa 40 CE, and neighbouring South Asian polities.[55]\nThe Indo-Parthian Kingdom was ruled by the Gondopharid dynasty, named after its eponymous first ruler Gondophares. They ruled parts of present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan,[56] and northwestern India, during or slightly before the 1st century AD. For most of their history, the leading Gondopharid kings held Taxila (in the present Punjab province of Pakistan) as their residence, but during their last few years of existence the capital shifted between Kabul and Peshawar. These kings have traditionally been referred to as Indo-Parthians, as their coinage was often inspired by the Arsacid dynasty, but they probably belonged to a wider groups of Iranic tribes who lived east of Parthia proper, and there is no evidence that all the kings who assumed the title *Gondophares*, which means \"Holder of Glory\", were even related. Christian writings claim that the Apostle Saint Thomas – an architect and skilled carpenter – had a long sojourn in the court of king Gondophares, had built a palace for the king at Taxila and had also ordained leaders for the Church before leaving for Indus Valley in a chariot, for sailing out to eventually reach Malabar Coast.\n\n\n\n### Kushan Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Kushan Empire, Kushan coinage, and Kanishka\n\n![](image)Peshawar's Kanishka stupa once kept sacred Buddhist relics in the Kanishka casket.\n![](image)A map of India in the 2nd century AD showing the extent of the Kushan Empire (in green) during the reign of Kanishka. Most historians consider the empire to have variously extended as far east as the middle Ganges plain,[57] to Varanasi on the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna,[58][59] or probably even Pataliputra.[60][61]\nThe Kushan Empire expanded out of what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the subcontinent under the leadership of their first emperor, Kujula Kadphises, about the middle of the 1st century CE. They were descended from an Indo-European, Central Asian people called the Yuezhi,[62][63] a branch of which was known as the Kushans. By the time of his grandson, Kanishka the Great, the empire spread to encompass much of Afghanistan[64] and the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent at least as far as Saketa and Sarnath near Varanasi (Benares).[65]\n\n\nEmperor Kanishka was a great patron of Buddhism; however, as Kushans expanded southward, the deities[66] of their later coinage came to reflect its new Hindu majority.[67] The monumental Kanishka stupa is believed to have been established by the king near the outskirts of modern-day Peshawar, Pakistan.\n\n\nThe Kushan dynasty played an important role in the establishment of Buddhism in India and its spread to Central Asia and China. Historian Vincent Smith said about Kanishka in particular:\n\n\n\n\n> He played the part of a second Ashoka in the history of Buddhism.[68]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe empire linked the Indian Ocean maritime trade with the commerce of the Silk Road through the Indus valley, encouraging long-distance trade, particularly between China and Rome. The Kushans brought new trends to the budding and blossoming Gandharan Art, which reached its peak during Kushan Rule.\n\n\nH.G. Rowlinson commented:\n\n\n\n\n> The Kushan period is a fitting prelude to the Age of the Guptas.[69]\n> \n> \n\n\nBy the 3rd century, their empire in India was disintegrating and their last known great emperor was Vasudeva I.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### Alchon Huns[edit]\n\n\nThe Alchon Empire was the third of four major Huna states established in Central and South Asia. The Alchon were preceded by the Kidarites and succeeded by the Hephthalites in Bactria and the Nezak Huns in the Hindu Kush. The names of the Alchon kings are known from their extensive coinage, Buddhist accounts, and a number of commemorative inscriptions throughout the Indian subcontinent. Toramana's son Mihirakula, a Saivite Hindu, moved up to near Pataliputra to the east and Gwalior to central India. Hiuen Tsiang narrates Mihirakula's merciless persecution of Buddhists and destruction of monasteries, though the description is disputed as far as the authenticity is concerned.[72] The Alchons have long been considered as a part or a sub-division of the Hephthalites, or as their eastern branch, but now tend to be considered as a separate entity.[73][74][75] The Huns were defeated by the alliance of Indian rulers, Maharaja (Great King) Yasodharman of Malwa and Gupta Emperor Narasimhagupta in the 6th century. Some of them were driven out of India and others were assimilated in the Indian society.[76]\n\n\n\n## Medieval period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The expansion of the Arab Caliphate. Expansion under Muhammad, 622–632\n Expansion during the Rashidun Caliphate, 632–661\n Expansion during the Umayyad Caliphate, 661–750\n\n### Arab Caliphate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Rashidun Caliphate and Umayyad Caliphate\n\nFurther information: Caliphate campaigns in India\n\nAfter conquering the Middle East from the Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Empire, the Rashidun Caliphate reached the coastal region of Makran in present-day Balochistan. In 643, the second caliph Umar (r. 634–644) ordered an invasion of Makran against the Rai dynasty. Following the Rashidun capture of Makran, Umar restricted the army to not pass beyond and consolidated his position in Makran.[77] During the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (r. 656–661), the Rashidun army conquered the town of Kalat in the heart of Balochistan.[78]\nDuring the reign of the sixth Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715), the Arab military general Muhammad ibn al-Qasim commanded the Umayyad incursion into Sindh. In 712, he defeated the army of the Hindu *maharaja* Dahir of Aror (r. 695–712) and established the caliphal province of Sind. The historic town of al-Mansura was administered as the capital of the province. Afterward, Ibn al-Qasim proceeded to conquer Multan, which subsequently became a prominent center of Islamic culture and trading. In 747, the anti-Umayyad rebel Mansur ibn Jumhur al-Kalbi seized Sind and was defeated by Musa ibn Ka'b al-Tamimi of the succeeding Abbasid Caliphate. In the 9th-century, Abbasid authority gradually declined in Sind and Multan. The tenth Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861) assigned the governorship of Sind to Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Habbari, who founded the hereditary Habbarid dynasty and became the autonomous ruler of Sind in 854. Around the same time, the Banu Munnabih established the Emirate of Multan while Ma'danids reigned over Sultanate of Makran. There was gradual conversion to Islam in the south, especially amongst the native Hindu and Buddhist majority, but in areas north of Multan, Hindus and Buddhists remained numerous.[79] By the end of the 10th century CE, the region was ruled by several Hindu kings.\n\n\n\n### Odi Shahis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Turk Shahis and Hindu Shahi\n\n![](image)Amb Temples, built by the Hindu Shahi dynasty between the 7th and 9th centuries CE\nThe Turk Shahis ruled Gandhara from the decline of the Kushan Empire in the 3rd century until 870, when they were overthrown by the Hindu Shahis. The Hindu Shahis are believed to belong to the Uḍi/Oḍi tribe, namely the people of Oddiyana in Gandhara.[80][81]\n\n\nThe first king Kallar had moved the capital into Udabandhapura from Kabul, in the modern village of Hund for its new capital.[82][83][84][85] At its zenith, the kingdom stretched over the Kabul Valley, Gandhara and western Punjab under Jayapala.[86] Jayapala saw a danger in the consolidation of the Ghaznavids and invaded their capital city of Ghazni both in the reign of Sebuktigin and in that of his son Mahmud, which initiated the Muslim Ghaznavid and Hindu Shahi struggles.[87] Sebuk Tigin, however, defeated him, and he was forced to pay an indemnity.[87] Jayapala defaulted on the payment and took to the battlefield once more.[87] Jayapala however, lost control of the entire region between the Kabul Valley and Indus River.[88]\n\n\nHowever, the army was defeated in battle against the western forces, particularly against the Mahmud of Ghazni.[88] In the year 1001, soon after Sultan Mahmud came to power and was occupied with the Qarakhanids north of the Hindu Kush, Jaipal attacked Ghazni once more and upon suffering yet another defeat by the powerful Ghaznavid forces, near present-day Peshawar. After the Battle of Peshawar, he died because of regretting as his subjects brought disaster and disgrace to the Shahi dynasty.[87][88]\n\n\nJayapala was succeeded by his son Anandapala,[87] who along with other succeeding generations of the Shahiya dynasty took part in various unsuccessful campaigns against the advancing Ghaznvids but were unsuccessful. The Hindu rulers eventually exiled themselves to the Kashmir Siwalik Hills.[88]\n\n\n\n### Ghaznavid dynasty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ghaznavids\n\n![](image)Ghaznavid Empire at its greatest extent in 1030 CE\nIn 997 CE, the Turkic ruler Mahmud of Ghazni, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sebuktegin, a Turkic origin ruler. Starting from the city of Ghazni (now in Afghanistan), Mehmood conquered the bulk of Khorasan, marched on Peshawar against the Hindu Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab (1007), deposed the Shia Ismaili rulers of Multan, (1011), Kashmir (1015) and Qanoch (1017). By the end of his reign in 1030, Mahmud's empire briefly extended from Kurdistan in the west to the Yamuna river in the east, and the Ghaznavid dynasty lasted until 1187. Contemporary historians such as Abolfazl Beyhaqi and Ferdowsi described extensive building work in Lahore, as well as Mahmud's support and patronage of learning, literature and the arts.\n\n\nMahmud's successors, known as the Ghaznavids, ruled for 157 years. Their kingdom gradually shrank in size, and was racked by bitter succession struggles. The Hindu Rajput kingdoms of western India reconquered the eastern Punjab, and by the 1160s, the line of demarcation between the Ghaznavid state and the Hindu kingdoms approximated to the present-day boundary between India and Pakistan. The Ghurid Empire of central Afghanistan occupied Ghazni around 1160, and the Ghaznavid capital was shifted to Lahore. Later Muhammad Ghori conquered the Ghaznavid kingdom, occupying Lahore in 1187.[89]\n\n\n\n### Ghurid dynasty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ghurid dynasty\n\n![](image)Map of Ghurid territory, before the assassination of Muhammad of Ghor.[90][91][92] In the west, Ghurid territory extended to Nishapur and Merv,[93][94] while Ghurid troops reached as far as Gorgan on the shores of the Caspian Sea.[95][96] Eastward, the Ghurids invaded as far as Bengal.[97]\nThe Ghaznavids under either Khusrau Shah or his son Khusrau Malik lost their control over Ghazni to the Ghuzz Turks along with some other territories. In the 1170s, Ghurid prince Muhammad of Ghor raided their territory and captured Ghazni from them and was crowned there by his brother Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad in 1173. Muhammad of Ghor marched from Gomal Pass into Pakistan and captured Multan and Uch before being rebuffed by Gujarat's Hindu Chaulukya (Solanki) rulers, which forced him to press upon the trumbling Ghaznavids. By 1186–87, he deposed the last Ghaznavid ruler Khusrau Malik, bringing the last of Ghaznevid territory under his control and ending the Ghaznavid empire. The Ghurids were overthrown in 1215, although their conquests in the Indian Subcontinent survived for several centuries under the Delhi Sultanate established by the Ghurid Mamluk Qutb ud-Din Aibak.\n\n\n\n### Delhi Sultanate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Delhi Sultanate\n\n![](image)Delhi Sultanate at its greatest extent, under the Tughlaq dynasty, 1330–1335.[98][99]\n![](image)Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam, built by Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq in 1324 CE\nThe Turkic origin Mamluk Dynasty, seized the throne of the Sultanate in 1211. Several dynasties ruled their empires from Delhi: the Mamluk (1211–90), the Khalji (1290–1320), the Tughlaq (1320–1413), the Sayyid (1414–1451) and the Lodhi (1451–1526).[100] Although some kingdoms remained independent of Delhi, almost all of the Indus plain came under the rule of these large sultanates.\n\n\nThe sultans (emperors) of Delhi enjoyed cordial relations with rulers in the Near East but owed them no allegiance. While the sultans ruled from urban centres, their military camps and trading posts provided the nuclei for many towns that sprang up in the countryside. Close interaction with local populations led to cultural exchange and the resulting \"Indo-Islamic\" fusion has left a lasting imprint and legacy in South Asian architecture, music, literature, life style and religious customs. In addition, the language of Urdu (literally meaning \"horde\" or \"camp\" in various Turkic dialects, but more likely \"city\" in the South Asian context) was born during the Delhi Sultanate period, as a result of the mingling of speakers of native Prakrits, Persian, Turkish and Arabic languages.\n\n\nPerhaps the greatest contribution of the Sultanate was its temporary success in insulating South Asia from the Mongol invasion from Central Asia in the 13th century; nonetheless the sultans eventually lost western Pakistan to the Mongols (see the Ilkhanate dynasty). The Sultanate declined after the invasion of Emperor Timur, who founded the Timurid Empire, and was eventually conquered in 1526 by the Mughal Emperor Babar.\n\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire attracted Muslim refugees, nobles, technocrats, bureaucrats, soldiers, traders, scientists, architects, artisans, teachers, poets, artists, theologians and Sufis from the rest of the Muslim world and they migrated and settled in the South Asia. During the reign of Sultan Ghyasuddin Balban (1266–1286) thousands of Central Asian Muslims sought asylum including more than 15 sovereigns and their nobles due to the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran. At the court of Sultan Iltemish in Delhi the first wave of these Muslim refugees escaping from the Central Asian genocide by the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan, brought administrators from Iran, painters from China, theologians from Samarkand, Nishapur and Bukhara, divines and saints from the rest of Muslim world, craftsmen and men and maidens from every region, notably doctors adept in Greek medicine and philosophers from everywhere.\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Sindh[edit]\n\n\n#### Soomra dynasty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Soomra dynasty\n\nThe Soomra dynasty was a local Sindhi Muslim dynasty that ruled between the early 11th century and the 14th century.[101][102][103]\n\n\nLater chroniclers like Ali ibn al-Athir (c. late 12th c.) and Ibn Khaldun (c. late 14th c.) attributed the fall of Habbarids to Mahmud of Ghazni, lending credence to the argument of Hafif being the last Habbarid.[104] The Soomras appear to have established themselves as a regional power in this power vacuum.[104][105]\n\n\nThe Ghurids and Ghaznavids continued to rule parts of Sindh, across the eleventh and early twelfth century, alongside Soomrus.[104] The precise delineations are not yet known but Sommrus were probably centered in lower Sindh.[104]\n\n\nSome of them were adherents of Isma'ilism.[105] One of their kings Shimuddin Chamisar had submitted to Iltutmish, the Sultan of Delhi, and was allowed to continue on as a vassal.[106]\n\n\n\n#### Samma dynasty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Samma dynasty\n\nMakli Necropolis\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Makli Necropolis at Thatta is one of the largest funerary sites in the world.[107]\n\nThe Samma dynasty was a Sindhi dynasty that ruled in Sindh, and parts of Kutch, Punjab and Balochistan from c. 1351 to c. 1524 CE, with their capital at Thatta.[108][109][110]\n\n\nThe Sammas overthrew the Soomra dynasty soon after 1335 and the last Soomra ruler took shelter with the governor of Gujarat, under the protection of Muhammad bin Tughluq, the sultan of Delhi. Mohammad bin Tughlaq made an expedition against Sindh in 1351 and died at Sondha, possibly in an attempt to restore the Soomras. With this, the Sammas became independent. The next sultan, Firuz Shah Tughlaq attacked Sindh in 1365 and 1367, unsuccessfully, but with reinforcements from Delhi he later obtained Banbhiniyo's surrender. For a period the Sammas were therefore subject to Delhi again. Later, as the Sultanate of Delhi collapsed they became fully independent.[111] Jam Unar was the founder of Samma dynasty mentioned by Ibn Battuta.[111]\n\n\nThe Samma civilization contributed significantly to the evolution of the Indo-Islamic architectural style. Thatta is famous for its necropolis, which covers 10 square km on the Makli Hill.[112] It has left its mark in Sindh with magnificent structures including the Makli Necropolis of its royals in Thatta.[108][113]\n\n\n\n## Early Modern Period[edit]\n\n\n### Mughal Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mughal Empire\n\nFurther information: Mughal Architecture, Mughal clothing, and Mughlai cuisine\n\n![](image)The empire at its greatest extent in c. 1700 under Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707)\nMughal Architecture in Pakistan\n![](image)\nShalimar Gardens at Lahore[114]\n![](image)\nThe Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore Fort was built during the reign of Aurangzeb.[114]\n![](image)\nDiwan-i-Khas at Lahore Fort was built during the reign of Shah Jahan.\n![](image)\nThe Badshahi Mosque, built by Aurangzeb, is one of the largest mosques in Pakistan.\n![](image)\nWazir Khan Mosque at Lahore, richly decorated with Mughal frescoes\n![](image)\nThe Akbari Sarai features a monumental gateway that leads to the Tomb of Jahangir.\n\nIn 1526, Babur, a Timurid descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan from Fergana Valley (modern-day Uzbekistan), swept across the Khyber Pass and founded the Mughal Empire, covering parts of modern-day eastern- Afghanistan, much of what is now Pakistan, parts of India and Bangladesh.[115] The Mughals were descended from Central Asian Turks (with significant Mongol admixture).\n\n\nHowever, his son and successor Humayun was defeated by Sher Shah Suri who was from Bihar state of India, in the year 1540, and Humayun was forced to retreat to Kabul. After Sher Shah died, his son Islam Shah Suri became the ruler, on whose death his prime minister, Hemu ascended the throne and ruled North India from Delhi for one month. He was defeated by Emperor Akbar's forces in the Second Battle of Panipat on 6 November 1556.\n\n\nAkbar, was both a capable ruler and an early proponent of religious and ethnic tolerance and favoured an early form of multiculturalism. For example, he declared \"Amari\" or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism and rolled back the *jizya* tax imposed upon non-Islamic mainly Hindu people. The Mughal dynasty ruled most of the South Asia by 1600. The Mughal emperors married local royalty and allied themselves with local *maharajas*. Akbar was succeeded by Jahangir who was succeeded by Shah Jahan. Shah Jahan was replaced by Aurangzeb following the Mughal war of succession (1658–1659).\n\n\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, different regions of modern Pakistan and India began asserting independence. The empire went into a rapid decline and by about 1720 only really controlled a small region around Delhi. The emperors continued have lip service paid to them as \"Emperor of India\" by the other powers in South Asia until the British finally abolished the empire in 1858.\n\n\nFor a short time in the late 16th century, Lahore was the capital of the empire. The architectural legacy of the Mughals includes the Lahore Fort, Wazir Khan Mosque, Shalimar Gardens, Tomb of Jahangir, Tomb of Nur Jahan, Akbari Sarai, Hiran Minar, Shah Jahan Mosque and the Badshahi Mosque.[114] The Mughal Empire had a great impact on the culture, cuisine, and architecture of Pakistan.\n\n\n\n### Decline of Mughal empire[edit]\n\n\nBy early 18th century, the Mughal empire declined. In 1749, the Mughals were induced to cede Sindh, the Punjab region and the important trans Indus River to Ahmad Shah Durrani in order to save his capital from Afghan attack.[116] Ahmad Shah sacked Delhi in 1757 but permitted the Mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control of the city as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah's suzerainty over Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir. Leaving his second son Timur Shah to safeguard his interests, Ahmad Shah left India to return to Afghanistan.\n\n\nIn 1751–52, *Ahamdiya* treaty was signed between the Marathas and Mughals, when Balaji Bajirao was the Peshwa.[117] Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled whole of India from their capital at Pune and the Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi (the Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao sent Raghunathrao. He defeated the Rohillas and Afghan garrisons in Punjab and succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule.[118] Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Ahmad was forced to return to India and face the Maratha Confederacy.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bala Hissar fort in Peshawar was one of the royal residences of the Durrani kings.\nIn 1758, the Maratha Empire's general Raghunath Rao attacked and conquered Punjab, frontier regions and Kashmir and drove out Timur Shah Durrani, the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali. In 1759, the Marathas and its allies won the Battle of Lahore, defeating the Durranis,[119][120] hence, Lahore, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Peshawar, Kashmir, and other subahs on the south eastern side of Afghanistan's border fell under the Maratha rule.[121]\n\n\nAhmad Shah declared a jihad (or Islamic holy war) against the Marathas, and warriors from various Afghan tribes joined his army. Early skirmishes were followed by decisive victory for the Afghans against the much larger Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad Shah and his army reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, Panipat was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of northern India. The Third Battle of Panipat (14 January 1761), fought between largely Muslim and largely Hindu armies was waged along a twelve-kilometer front. Although the Durrani's army decisively defeated the Marathas, they suffered heavily in the battle.\n\n\nThe victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah's—and Afghan—power. However, even prior to his death, the empire began to face challenges in the form of a rising Sikhs in Punjab. In 1762, Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to subdue the Sikhs. From this time and on, the domination and control of the Empire began to loosen, and by the time of Durrani's death he had completely lost Punjab to the Sikhs, as well as earlier losses of northern territories to the Uzbeks, necessitating a compromise with them.[122]\n\n\n\n### Sikh Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sikh Empire and History of Sikhism\n\n![](image)Samadhi of Ranjit Singh, with the minaret of Badshahi Mosque in the background\nGuru Nanak (29 November 1469 – 22 September 1539), Sikhism's founder, was born into a Hindu Khatri family in the village of *Rāi Bhōi dī Talwandī (*present day Nankana, near Sial in modern-day Pakistan). He was an influential religious and social reformer in north India and the saintly founder of a modern monotheistic order and first of the ten divine Gurus of Sikh religion. At the age of 70, he died at Kartarpur, Punjab of modern-day Pakistan.\n\n\nThe Sikh Empire (1799–1849) was formed on the foundations of the Sikh Khalsa Army by Maharaja Ranjit Singh who was proclaimed \"*Sarkar-i-Khalsa*\", and was referred to as the \"Maharaja of Lahore\".[123] It consisted of a collection of autonomous Punjabi Misls, which were governed by Misldars,[124] mainly in the Punjab region. The empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Multan in the south and Kapurthala in the east. The main geographical footprint of the empire was the Punjab region. The formation of the empire was a watershed and represented formidable consolidation of Sikh military power and resurgence of local culture, which had been dominated for hundreds of years by Indo-Afghan and Indo-Mughal hybrid cultures.\n\n\nThe foundations of the Sikh Empire, during the time of the Sikh Khalsa Army, could be defined as early as 1707, starting from the death of Aurangzeb. The fall of the Mughal Empire provided opportunities for the Sikh army to lead expeditions against the Mughals and Pashtuns. This led to a growth of the army, which was split into different Sikh armies and then semi-independent \"misls\". Each of these component armies were known as a misl, each controlling different areas and cities. However, in the period from 1762 to 1799, Sikh rulers of their misls appeared to be coming into their own. The formal start of the Sikh Empire began with the disbandment of the Sikh Khalsa Army by the time of coronation of Ranjit Singh in 1801, creating a unified political state. All the misl leaders who were affiliated with the Army were from Punjab's nobility.[124]\n\n\n\n## Colonial period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British raj, Indian independence movement, Partition of India, and British heritage of Pakistan\n\nIndo-Saracenic Revival architecture in Pakistan\n![](image)\nLahore Museum\n![](image)\nIslamia College, Peshawar\n![](image)\nSadiq Dane High School, Bahawalpur\n![](image)\nUniversity of the Punjab, Lahore\n\nNone of the territory of modern Pakistan was ruled by the British, or other European powers, until 1839, when Karachi, then a small fishing village with a mud fort guarding the harbour, was taken, and held as an enclave with a port and military base for the First Afghan War that soon followed. The rest of Sindh was taken in 1843, and in the following decades, first the East India Company, and then after the post-Sepoy Mutiny (1857–1858) direct rule of Queen Victoria of the British Empire, took over most of the country partly through wars, and also treaties. The main wars were that against the Baloch Talpur dynasty, ended by the Battle of Miani (1843) in Sindh, the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849) and the Anglo-Afghan Wars (1839–1919). By 1893, all modern Pakistan was part of the British Indian Empire, and remained so until independence in 1947.\n\n\nUnder the British, modern Pakistan was mostly divided into the Sind Division, Punjab Province, and the Baluchistan Agency. There were various princely states, of which the largest was Bahawalpur. Sindh was part of the Bombay Presidency, and there were many complaints over the years that it was neglected by its distant rulers in modern Mumbai, although there was usually a Commissioner based in Karachi.\n\n\nThe Punjab (which included the modern Indian state) was instead technically ruled from even more distant Calcutta, as part of the Bengal Presidency, but in practice most matters were devolved to local British officials, who were often among the most energetic and effective in India. At first there was a \"Board of Administration\" led by Sir Henry Lawrence, who had previously worked as British Resident at the Lahore Durbar and also consisted of his younger brother John Lawrence and Charles Grenville Mansel.[125] Below the Board worked a group of acclaimed officers collectively known as Henry Lawrence's \"Young Men\". After the Mutiny, Sir John Lawrence became the first Governor of Punjab. The Punjab Canal Colonies were an ambitious and largely successful project, begun in the 1880s, to create new farmland through irrigation, to relieve population pressure elsewhere (most of the areas involved are now in Pakistan).\n\n\nThe Baluchistan Agency largely consisted of princely states and tribal territories, and was governed with a light touch, although near the Afghan border Quetta was built up as a military base, in case of invasion by either the Afghans or the Russians. The 1935 Quetta earthquake was a major disaster. From 1876 the sensitive far north was made a \"Chief Commissioner's Province\". The border with Afghanistan, which remains the modern border of Pakistan, was finally fixed on the Durand Line in 1893.\n\n\nRailway construction began in the 1850s, and most of the network (some now discontinued) was completed by 1900. Karachi expanded enormously under British rule, followed to a lesser extent by Lahore and the other larger cities.\n\n\nDifferent Regions of Pakistan were conquered by East India Company as below:  \n\n•Sindh was conquered by Battle of Hyderabad and Battle of Miani in 1843.  \n\n•Punjab and eastern Khyber pakhtunkhwa were conquered during Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849.\n\n\nRegions conquered by British Raj are as below:  \n\n•Southern Balochistan came under control by Treaty of Kalat in 1876.  \n\n•Western Balochistan was conquered by British empire in Second Anglo-Afghan War through Treaty of Gandamak, in 1879.\n\n\n\n### Early period of Pakistan Movement[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: All-India Muslim League, Pakistan Movement, and Lahore Resolution\n\nIn 1877, Syed Ameer Ali had formed the *Central National Muhammadan Association* to work towards the political advancement of the Indian Muslims, who had suffered grievously in 1857, in the aftermath of the failed Sepoy Mutiny against the East India Company; the British were seen as foreign invaders. But the organization declined towards the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lord Minto met with the Muslim delegation in June 1906. The Minto-Morley Reforms of 1909 called for separate Muslim electorates.\nIn 1885, the Indian National Congress was founded as a forum, which later became a party, to promote a nationalist cause.[126] Although the Congress attempted to include the Muslim community in the struggle for independence from the British rule – and some Muslims were very active in the Congress – the majority of Muslim leaders, including the influential Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, did not trust the party.\n\n\nA turning point came in 1900, when the British administration in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh acceded to Hindu demands and made Hindi, the version of the Hindustani language written in the Devanagari script, the official language. The proselytisation conducted in the region by the activists of a new Hindu reformist movement also stirred Muslim's concerns about their faith. Eventually, the Muslims feared that the Hindu majority would seek to suppress the rights of Muslims in the region following the departure of the British.\n\n\n\n### Muslim League[edit]\n\n\nThe All-India Muslim League was founded by Shaiiq-e-Mustafa on 30 December 1906, in the aftermath of division of Bengal, on the sidelines of the annual All India Muhammadan Educational Conference in Shahbagh, Dhaka East Bengal.[127] The meeting was attended by three thousand delegates and presided over by Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk. It addressed the issue of safeguarding interests of Muslims and finalised a programme. A resolution, moved by Nawab Salimullah and seconded by Hakim Ajmal Khan. Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk (conservative), declared:\n\n\n\n\n> The Musalmans are only a fifth in number as compared with the total population of the country, and it is manifest that if at any remote period the British government ceases to exist in India, then the rule of India would pass into the hands of that community which is nearly four times as large as ourselves ... our life, our property, our honour, and our faith will all be in great danger, when even now that a powerful British administration is protecting its subjects, we the Musalmans have to face most serious difficulties in safe-guarding our interests from the grasping hands of our neighbors.[128]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe constitution and principles of the League were contained in the *Green Book*, written by Maulana Mohammad Ali. Its goals at this stage did not include establishing an independent Muslim state, but rather concentrated on protecting Muslim liberties and rights, promoting understanding between the Muslim community and other Indians, educating the Muslim and Indian community at large on the actions of the government, and discouraging violence. However, several factors over the next thirty years, including sectarian violence, led to a re-evaluation of the League's aims.[129][130] Among those Muslims in the Congress who did not initially join the League was Jinnah, a prominent statesman and barrister in Bombay. This was because the first article of the League's platform was \"To promote among the Mussalmans (Muslims) of India, feelings of loyalty to the British Government\". The League remained loyal to the British administration for five years until the British decided to reverse the partition of Bengal. The Muslim League saw this British decision as partial to Hindus.[131]\n\n\n\n![](image)George VI, Emperor of India\nIn 1907, a vocal group of Hindu hard-liners within the Indian National Congress movement separated from it and started to pursue a pro-Hindu movement openly. This group was spearheaded by the famous triumvirate of Lal-Bal-Pal – Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal of Punjab, Bombay and Bengal provinces respectively. Their influence spread rapidly among other like minded Hindus – they called it Hindu nationalism – and it became a cause of serious concern for Muslims.\nHowever, Jinnah did not join the League until 1913, when the party changed its platform to one of Indian independence, as a reaction against the British decision to reverse the 1905 Partition of Bengal, which the League regarded it as a betrayal of the Bengali Muslims.[132] After vociferous protests of the Hindu population and violence engineered by secret groups, such as Anushilan Samiti and its offshoot Jugantar of Aurobindo and his brother etc., the British had decided to reunite Bengal again. Till this stage, Jinnah believed in Mutual co-operation to achieve an independent, united 'India', although he argued that Muslims should be guaranteed one-third of the seats in any Indian Parliament.\n\n\n\n![](image)Allama Sir Muhammad Iqbal\nThe League gradually became the leading representative body of Indian Muslims. Jinnah became its president in 1916, and negotiated the Lucknow Pact with the Congress leader, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, by which Congress conceded the principle of separate electorates and weighted representation for the Muslim community.[133] However, Jinnah broke with the Congress in 1920 when the Congress leader, Mohandas Gandhi, launched a law violating Non-Cooperation Movement against the British, which a temperamentally law-abiding barrister Jinnah disapproved of. Jinnah also became convinced that the Congress would renounce its support for separate electorates for Muslims, which indeed it did in 1928. In 1927, the British proposed a constitution for India as recommended by the Simon Commission, but they failed to reconcile all parties. The British then turned the matter over to the League and the Congress, and in 1928 an All-Parties Congress was convened in Delhi. The attempt failed, but two more conferences were held, and at the Bombay conference in May, it was agreed that a small committee should work on the constitution. The prominent Congress leader Motilal Nehru headed the committee, which included two Muslims, Syed Ali Imam and Shoaib Quereshi; Motilal's son, Pt Jawaharlal Nehru, was its secretary. The League, however, rejected the committee's report, the so-called Nehru Report, arguing that its proposals gave too little representation (one quarter) to Muslims – the League had demanded at least one-third representation in the legislature. Jinnah announced a \"parting of the ways\" after reading the report, and relations between the Congress and the League began to sour.\n\n\n\n### Muslim homeland – \"*Now or Never*\"[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pakistan Declaration; Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?; and United Kingdom general election, 1929\n\n![](image)Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman seconding the Resolution with Jinnah and Ali Khan presiding the session\nThe general elections held in the United Kingdom had already weakened the leftist Labour Party led by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.[134] Furthermore, the Labour Party's government was already weakened by the outcomes of World War I, which fueled new hopes for progress towards self-government in British India.[134] In fact, Mohandas K. Gandhi traveled to London to press the idea of \"self-government\" in British India, and claimed to represent all Indians whilst duly criticized the Muslim League as being sectarian and divisive.[134] After reviewing the report of the Simon Commission, the Indian Congress initiated a massive Civil Disobedience Movement under Gandhi; the Muslim League reserved their opinion on the Simon Report declaring that the report was not final and the matters should be decided after consultations with the leaders representing all communities in India.[134]\n\n\nThe Round-table Conferences was held, but these achieved little, since Gandhi and the League were unable to reach a compromise.[134] Witnessing the events of the Round Table Conferences, Jinnah had despaired of politics and particularly of getting mainstream parties like the Congress to be sensitive to minority priorities. During this time in 1930, notable writer and poet, Muhammad Iqbal called for a separate and autonomous nation-state, who in his presidential address to the 1930 convention of the Muslim League said that he felt that a separate Muslim state was essential in an otherwise Hindu-dominated South Asia.[135][136]\n\n\n\n\n> India is a continent of human groups belonging to different races, speaking different languages, and professing different religions [...] Personally, I would like to see the Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sind and Baluchistan amalgamated into a single state. Self-government within the British Empire, or without the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated North-West Indian Muslim State appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of North-West India.\n> \n> — Muhammad Iqbal, Allahabad Address\n> \n\n![](image)Dream of Iqbal and Ali's *Now or Never* idealized the merger of the four provinces into a nation-state, called Pakistan.\nThe name of the nation-state was coined by the Cambridge University's political science student and Muslim nationalist Rahmat Ali,[137] and was published on 28 January 1933 in the pamphlet *Now or Never*.[138] After coining the name of the nation-state, Ali noticed that there is an acronym formed from the names of the \"homelands\" of Muslims in northwest India:\n\n\n\n* \"**P**\" for **P**unjab\n* \"**A**\" for **A**fghania (now known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)\n* \"**K**\" for **K**ashmir\n* \"**S**\" for **S**indh\n* \"**Tan**\" for Balochis**tan**; thus forming \"Pakistan\".[139][140]\n\n\nAfter the publication of the pamphlet, the Hindu Press vehemently criticized it, and the word 'Pakstan' used in it.[141] Thus this word became a heated topic of debate. With the addition of an \"i\" to improve the pronunciation, the name of Pakistan grew in popularity and led to the commencement of the Pakistan Movement, and consequently the creation of Pakistan.[142]\nIn Urdu and Persian languages, the name encapsulates the concept of *Pak* (\"pure\") and *stan* (\"land\") and hence a \"Pure Land\".[143] In 1935, the British government proposed to hand over substantial power to elected Indian provincial legislatures, with elections to be held in 1937.[144] After the elections the League took office in Bengal and Punjab, but the Congress won office in most of the other provinces, and refused to devolve power with the League in provinces with large Muslim minorities citing technical difficulties. The subsequent Congress Rule was unpopular among Muslims and seen as a reign of Hindu tyranny by Muslim leaders. Mohammad Ali Jinnah declared 22 December 1939, a \"Day of Deliverance\" for Indian Muslims. It was meant to celebrate the resignation of all members of the Congress party from provincial and central offices.[145]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Muslim ideologues for independence also felt vindicated by the presidential address of V.D. Savarkar at the 19th session of the famous Hindu nationalist party Hindu Mahasabha in 1937. In it, this legendary revolutionary – popularly called Veer Savarkar and known as the iconic father of the Hindu fundamentalist ideology – propounded the seminal ideas of his Two Nation Theory or ethnic exclusivism, which influenced Jinnah profoundly.\n\n\n\n### 1940 Resolution[edit]\n\n\nIn 1940, Jinnah called a general session of the Muslim League in Lahore to discuss the situation that had arisen due to the outbreak of World War II and the Government of India joining the war without consulting Indian leaders. The meeting was also aimed at analyzing the reasons that led to the defeat of the Muslim League in the general election of 1937 in the Muslim majority provinces. In his speech, Jinnah criticized the Indian Congress and the nationalists, and espoused the Two-Nation Theory and the reasons for the demand for separate homelands.[146] Sikandar Hayat Khan, the Chief Minister of Punjab, drafted the original resolution, but disavowed the final version,[147] that had emerged after protracted redrafting by the Subject Committee of the Muslim League. The final text unambiguously rejected the concept of a United India because of increasing inter-religious violence[99] and recommended the creation of independent states.[148] The resolution was moved in the general session by *Shere-Bangla* Bengali nationalist, AKF Haq, the Chief Minister of Bengal, supported by Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman and other leaders and was adopted on 23 March 1940.[149] The Resolution read as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> No constitutional plan would be workable or acceptable to the Muslims unless geographical contiguous units are demarcated into regions which should be so constituted with such territorial readjustments as may be necessary. That the areas in which the Muslims are numerically in majority as in the North-Western and Eastern zones of India should be grouped to constitute independent states in which the constituent units shall be autonomous and sovereign ... That adequate, effective and mandatory safeguards shall be specifically provided in the constitution for minorities in the units and in the regions for the protection of their religious, cultural, economic, political, administrative and other rights of the minorities, with their consultation. Arrangements thus should be made for the security of Muslims where they were in a minority.[150]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)The Working Committee of the Muslim League in Lahore (1940)\n### Final phase of the Pakistan Movement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Karachi War Cemetery. About 87,000 soldiers from British India (which includes modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) died in World War II. Millions of civilians also died due to famines.\nImportant leaders in the Muslim League highlighted that Pakistan would be a 'New Medina', in other words the second Islamic state established after Muhammad's creation of an Islamic state in Medina. Pakistan was popularly envisaged as an Islamic utopia, a successor to the defunct Turkish Caliphate and a leader and protector of the entire Islamic world. Islamic scholars debated over whether it was possible for the proposed Pakistan to truly become an Islamic state.[151][152]\n\n\nWhile the Congress' top leadership had been in prison following the 1942 Quit India Movement, there was intense debate among Indian Muslims over the creation of a separate homeland.[152] The majority of Barelvis[153] and Barelvi ulema supported the creation of Pakistan[154] and *pirs* and Sunni ulema were mobilized by the Muslim League to demonstrate that India's Muslim masses wanted a separate country.[155] The Barelvis believed that any co-operation with Hindus would be counter productive.[156] On the other hand, most Deobandis, who were led by Maulana Husain Ahmad Madani, were opposed to the creation of Pakistan and the two-nation theory. According to them Muslims and Hindus could be one nation and Muslims were only a nation of themselves in the religious sense and not in the territorial sense.[157][158][159] At the same time some Deobandi ulema such as Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi, Mufti Muhammad Shafi and Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani were supportive of the Muslim League's demand to create a separate Pakistan.[155][160]\n\n\nMuslims who were living in provinces where they were demographically a minority, such as the United Provinces where the Muslim League enjoyed popular support, were assured by Jinnah that they could remain in India, migrate to Pakistan or continue living in India but as Pakistani citizens.\n\n\nIn the Constituent Assembly elections of 1946, the Muslim League won 425 out of 496 seats reserved for Muslims (polling 89.2% of total votes).[132] The Congress had hitherto refused to acknowledge the Muslim League's claim of being the representative of Indian Muslims but finally acquiesced to the League's claim after the results of this election. The Muslim League's demand for Pakistan had received overwhelming popular support from India's Muslims, especially those Muslims who were living in provinces such as UP where they were a minority.[161]\n\n\nThe British had neither the will, nor the financial resources or military power, to hold India any longer but they were also determined to avoid partition and for this purpose they arranged the Cabinet Mission Plan.[162] According to this plan India would be kept united but would be heavily decentralized with separate groupings of Hindu and Muslim majority provinces. The Muslim League accepted this plan as it contained the 'essence' of Pakistan but the Congress rejected it. After the failure of the Cabinet Mission Plan, Jinnah called for Muslims to observe Direct Action Day to demand the creation of a separate Pakistan. The Direct Action Day morphed into violent riots between Hindus and Muslims in Calcutta, with the violence displaying elements of ethnic cleansing. The riots in Calcutta were followed by intense communal rioting elsewhere, including in Noakhali (where Hindus were attacked by Muslims) and Bihar (where Hindus attacked Muslims) in October, resulting in large-scale displacement. In March 1947, such violence reached Punjab, where Sikhs and Hindus were massacred and driven out by Muslims in the Rawalpindi Division.[163]\n\n\nThe British Prime Minister Attlee appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten as India's last viceroy, to negotiate the independence of Pakistan and India and immediate British withdrawal. British leaders including Mountbatten did not support the creation of Pakistan but failed to convince Jinnah otherwise.[164][165] Mountbatten later confessed that he would most probably have sabotaged the creation of Pakistan had he known that Jinnah was dying of tuberculosis.[166]\n\n\nIn early 1947 the British had announced their desire to grant India its independence by June 1948. However, Lord Mountbatten decided to advance the date. In a meeting in June, Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad representing the Congress, Jinnah representing the Muslim League, B. R. Ambedkar representing the Untouchable community, and Master Tara Singh representing the Sikhs, agreed to partition India along religious lines.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Independence from the British Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indian Independence Act 1947, Independence Day (Pakistan), Partition of India, and Pakistan Movement\n\nOn 14 August 1947 Pakistan gained independence. India gained independence the following day. The two provinces of British India: Punjab and Bengal were divided along religious lines by the Radcliffe Commission. Mountbatten is alleged to have influenced the Radcliffe Commission to draw the line in India's favour.[167][168] Punjab's mostly Muslim western part went to Pakistan and its mostly Hindu/Sikh eastern part went to India but there were significant Muslim minorities in Punjab's eastern section and likewise there were many Hindus and Sikhs living in Punjab's western areas.\n\n\nIntense communal rioting in the Punjab forced the governments of India and Pakistan to agree to a forced population exchange of Muslim and Hindu/Sikh minorities living in Punjab. After this population exchange only a few thousand low-caste Hindus remained in Pakistan's side of Punjab and only a tiny Muslim population remained in the town of Malerkotla in India's part of Punjab.[169] Political scientist Ishtiaq Ahmed says that although Muslims started the violence in Punjab, by the end of 1947 more Muslims had been killed by Hindus and Sikhs in East Punjab than the number of Hindus and Sikhs who had been killed by Muslims in West Punjab.[170][171]\n\n\nMore than ten million people migrated across the new borders and between 200,000 and 2,000,000[172][173][174] people died in the spate of communal violence in the Punjab in what some scholars have described as a 'retributive genocide' between the religions.[175] The Pakistani government claimed that 50,000 Muslim women were abducted and raped by Hindu and Sikh men and similarly the Indian government claimed that Muslims abducted and raped 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women.[176][177][178] The two governments agreed to repatriate abducted women and thousands of Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women were repatriated to their families in the 1950s. The dispute over Kashmir escalated into the first war between India and Pakistan. The conflict remains unresolved.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)History portal\n* ![flag](image)Pakistan portal\n\n\n* History of Asia\n* History of South Asia\n* Islam in Pakistan\n* List of presidents of Pakistan\n* List of prime ministers of Pakistan\n* Meluhha\n* Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent\n* Politics of Pakistan\n* Timeline of Karachi\n* Timeline of Lahore\n* Timeline of Peshawar\n* Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Archaeological cultures identified with phases of Vedic culture include the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture, the Gandhara Grave culture, the Black and red ware culture and the Painted Grey Ware culture.[13]\n2. **^** The precise time span of the period is uncertain.

Prehistoric and protohistoric exchanges across the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalaya ranges demonstrate earlier precedents for routes through the high mountain passes and river valleys in later historical periods. Typological similarities between Northern Neolithic sites in Kashmir and Swat and sites in the Tibetan plateau and northern China show that 'Mountain chains have often integrated rather than isolated peoples.' Ties between the trading post of Shortughai in Badakhshan (northeastern Afghanistan) and the lower Indus valley provide evidence for long-distance commercial networks and 'polymorphous relations' across the Hindu Kush until c. 1800 B.C.' The Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) may have functioned as a 'filter' for the introduction of Indo-Iranian languages to the northwestern Indian subcontinent, although routes and chronologies remain hypothetical.

These three trade-routes, which carried the bulk of the traffic passing by land between India and Central and Western Asia, played an all-important part in the history of Taxila.

Genetic studies have revealed that India was the gateway to subsequent colonisation of Asia and Australia and saw the first major population expansion of modern human populations anywhere outside of Africa. South Asia therefore provides a crucial stepping-scone in early modern migration to Southeast Asia and Oceania.

Perhaps most importantly in a South Asian context, the role played by zebu makes this a distinctive, localised development, with a character completely different to other parts of the world. Finally, the longevity of the site, and its articulation with the neighbouring site of Nausharo (c. 2800—2000 BCE), provides a very clear continuity from South Asia's first farming villages to the emergence of its first cities (Jarrige, 1984).\"\n7. **^** Fisher, Michael H.

The highest echelons of imperial society lived in the inner circle composed of the ruler, his immediate family, other relatives, and close allies, who formed a dynastic core. Outside the core, empire travelled stringy routes dotted with armed cities. Outside the palace, in the capital cities, the highest ranks in the imperial elite were held by military commanders whose active loyalty and success in war determined imperial fortunes. Wherever these men failed or rebelled, dynastic power crumbled. ... Imperial society flourished where elites mingled; they were its backbone, its strength was theirs. Kautilya's *Arthasastra* indicates that imperial power was concentrated in its original heartland, in old *Magadha*, where key institutions seem to have survived for about seven hundred years, down to the age of the Guptas. Here, Mauryan officials ruled local society, but not elsewhere. In provincial towns and cities, officials formed a top layer of royalty; under them, old conquered royal families were not removed, but rather subordinated. In most *janapadas*, the Mauryan Empire consisted of strategic urban sites connected loosely to vast hinterlands through lineages and local elites who were there when the Mauryas arrived and were still in control when they left.\n38. **^** Hermann Kulke 2004, pp. xii, 448.\n39. **^** Thapar, Romila (1990). *A History of India, Volume 1*.

It was the power of the big zamindars in Punjab and Sindh behind the Muslim League candidates, and the powerful campaign among the poor peasants of Bengal on economic issues of rural indebtedness and zamindari abolition, that led to this massive landslide victory (Alavi 2002, 14). Even Congress, which had always denied the League's claim to be the only true representative of Indian Muslims had to concede the truth of that claim. The 1946 election was, in effect, a plebiscite among Muslims on Pakistan.\n162. **^** Barbara D. Metcalf; Thomas R. Metcalf (2002). *A Concise History of India*.

Over 100,000 people were made homeless. They were also present in the wave of violence that rippled out from Calcutta to Bihar, where there were high Muslim casualty figures, and to Noakhali deep in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta of Bengal. Concerning the Noakhali riots, one British officer spoke of a 'determined and organized' Muslim effort to drive out all the Hindus, who accounted for around a fifth of the total population. Similarly, the Punjab counterparts to this transition of violence were the Rawalpindi massacres of March 1947. The level of death and destruction in such West Punjab villages as Thoa Khalsa was such that communities couldn't live together in its wake.\n164. **^** McGrath, Allen (1996). *The Destruction of Pakistan's Democracy*.

In the Constituent Assembly in 1949 it was recorded that of the 50,000 Muslim women abducted in India, 8,000 of then were recovered, and of the 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women abducted, 12,000 were recovered.\n178. **^** Abraham, Taisha (2002). *Women and the Politics of Violence*.

1947[1] is shared with that of Afghanistan, India, and Iran. Spanning the western expanse of the Indian subcontinent and the eastern borderlands of the Iranian plateau, the region of present-day Pakistan served both as the fertile ground of a major civilization and as the gateway of South Asia to Central Asia and the Near East.[2][3]\n\n\nSituated on the first coastal migration route of *Homo sapiens* out of Africa, the region was inhabited early by modern humans.[4][5] The 9,000-year history of village life in South Asia traces back to the Neolithic (7000–4300 BCE) site of Mehrgarh in Pakistan,[6][7][8] and the 5,000-year history of urban life in South Asia to the various sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, including Mohenjo Daro and Harappa.[9][10]\n\n\nFollowing the decline of the Indus valley civilization, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration in the Vedic Period (1500–500 BCE), bringing with them came their distinctive religious traditions and practices which fused with local culture.[11] The Indo-Aryans religious beliefs and practices from the Bactria–Margiana culture and the native Harappan Indus beliefs of the former Indus Valley Civilisation eventually gave rise to Vedic culture and tribes.[12][note 1] Most notable among them was Gandhara civilization, which flourished at the crossroads of India, Central Asia, and the Middle East, connecting trade routes and absorbing cultural influences from diverse civilizations.[14] The initial early Vedic culture was a tribal, pastoral society centred in the Indus Valley, of what is today Pakistan. During this period the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, were composed.[note 2]\n\n\nThe ensuing millennia saw the region of present-day Pakistan absorb many influences—represented among others in the ancient, mainly Hindu-Buddhist, sites of Taxila, and Takht-i-Bahi, the 14th-century Islamic-Sindhi monuments of Thatta, and the 17th-century Mughal monuments of Lahore. In the first half of the 19th century, the region was appropriated by the East India Company, followed, after 1857, by 90 years of direct British rule, and ending with the creation of Pakistan in 1947, through the efforts, among others, of its future national poet Allama Iqbal and its founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Since then, the country has experienced both civilian-democratic and military rule, resulting in periods of significant economic and military growth as well as those of instability; significant during the latter, was the secession of East Pakistan as the new nation of Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n\n## History by region[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Timeline of Pakistani history\n\n* History of Azad Jammu & Kashmir\n* History of Balochistan\n* History of East Pakistan\n* History of Gilgit-Baltistan\n* History of Islamabad Capital Territory\n* History of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n* History of Punjab\n* History of Sindh\n\n## Prehistory[edit]\n\n\n### Paleolithic period[edit]\n\n\nFile:Cave Paintings Tharia.jpgHumped bulls in the Tharia Cave Paintings, Balochistan, Pakistan\nThe Soanian is archaeological culture of the Lower Paleolithic, Acheulean. It is named after the Soan Valley in the Sivalik Hills, near modern-day Islamabad and is dated between c.774,000 and c.11,700 BCE.[16]\n\n\n\n### Neolithic period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mehrgarh\n\nMehrgarh is an important neolithic site discovered in 1974, which shows early evidence of farming and herding,[17] and dentistry.[18] The site dates back to 7000–5500 BCE and is located on the Kachi Plain of Balochistan. The residents of Mehrgarh lived in mud brick houses, stored grain in granaries, fashioned tools from copper, cultivated barley, wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. As the civilization progressed (5500–2600 BCE) residents began to engage in crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metalworking. The site was occupied continuously until 2600 BCE,[19] when climatic changes began to occur. Between 2600 and 2000 BCE, region became more arid and Mehrgarh was abandoned in favor of the Indus Valley,[20] where a new civilization was in the early stages of development.[21]\n\n\n\n## Bronze age[edit]\n\n\n### Indus Valley Civilisation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indus Valley Civilisation\n\nIndus Valley Civilization\n![](image)\nThe \"Priest King\" sculpture is carved from steatite.\n![](image)\nThe *Pashupati seal*\n![](image)\nThe Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-daro\n![](image)\nExcavated ruins of the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro in Sindh\n\n![](image)Indus Valley Civilisation\nThe Bronze Age in the Indus Valley began around 3300 BCE with the Indus Valley Civilization.[22] Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early civilizations of the Old World, and of the three the most widespread,[23] covering an area of 1.25 million km2.[24] It flourished in the basins of the Indus River, in what is today the Pakistani provinces of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan, and along a system of perennial, mostly monsoon-fed, rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the seasonal Ghaggar-Hakra River in parts of north-west India.[22] At its peak, the civilization hosted a population of approximately 5 million spread across hundreds of settlements extending as far as the Arabian Sea to present-day southern and eastern Afghanistan, and the Himalayas.[25] Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley, the Harappans, developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft (carneol products, seal carving), and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin.\n\n\nThe Mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilisation in the Indus Valley. The civilisation included urban centres such as Harappa, Ganeriwala and Mohenjo-daro as well as an offshoot called the Kulli culture (2500–2000 BCE) in southern Balochistan and was noted for its cities built of brick, roadside drainage system, and multi-storeyed houses. It is thought to have had some kind of municipal organisation as well.\n\n\nDuring the late period of this civilisation, signs of a gradual decline began to emerge, and by around 1700 BCE, most of the cities were abandoned. However, the Indus Valley Civilisation did not disappear suddenly, and some elements of the Indus Civilisation may have survived. Aridification of this region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial spur for the urbanisation associated with the civilisation, but eventually also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise, and to scatter its population eastward. The civilization collapsed around 1700 BCE, though the reasons behind its fall are still unknown. Through the excavation of the Indus cities and analysis of town planning and seals, it has been inferred that the Civilization had high level of sophistication in its town planning, arts, crafts, and trade.[26]\n\n\n\n## Early history – Iron Age[edit]\n\n\n### Vedic period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Vedic period, Indo-Aryan Migration, Indo-Aryans, and Vedas\n\nFurther information: Sintashta culture\n\n![](image)Archaeological cultures. The GGC, Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with Indo-Aryans.\nThe Vedic Period (c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE) is postulated to have formed during the 1500 BCE to 800 BCE. As Indo-Aryans migrated and settled into the Indus Valley, along with them came their distinctive religious traditions and practices which fused with local culture.[11] The Indo-Aryans religious beliefs and practices from the Bactria–Margiana Culture and the native Harappan Indus beliefs of the former Indus Valley Civilisation eventually gave rise to Vedic culture and tribes.[27][note 3] Early Indo-Aryans were a Late Bronze Age society centred in the Punjab, organised into tribes rather than kingdoms, and primarily sustained by a pastoral way of life. During this period the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, were composed.[note 4]\n\n\n\n## Ancient history[edit]\n\n\n### Achaemenid Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Achaemenid invasion of the Indus Valley\n\n![](image)Much of the area corresponding to modern-day Pakistan was subordinated to the Achaemenid Empire and forced to pay tributes to Persia.\n![](image)Ruins at Bhir Mound representing the city of Taxila during the Achaemenid period\nThe main Vedic tribes remaining in the Indus Valley by 550 BC were the *Kamboja*, *Sindhu*, *Taksas* of Gandhara, the *Madras* and *Kathas* of the River Chenab, *Mallas* of the River Ravi and *Tugras* of the River Sutlej. These several tribes and principalities fought against one another to such an extent that the Indus Valley no longer had one powerful Vedic tribal kingdom to defend against outsiders and to wield the warring tribes into one organized kingdom. King Pushkarasarin of Gandhara was engaged in power struggles against his local rivals and as such the Khyber Pass remained poorly defended. King Darius I of the Achaemenid Empire took advantage of the opportunity and planned for an invasion. The Indus Valley was fabled in Persia for its gold and fertile soil and conquering it had been a major objective of his predecessor Cyrus The Great.[28] In 542 BC, Cyrus had led his army and conquered the Makran coast in southern Balochistan. However, he is known to have campaigned beyond Makran (in the regions of Kalat, Khuzdar and Panjgur) and lost most of his army in the *Gedrosian Desert* (speculated today as the Kharan Desert).\n\n\nIn 518 BC, Darius led his army through the Khyber Pass and southwards in stages, eventually reaching the Arabian Sea coast in Sindh by 516 BC. Under Persian rule, a system of centralized administration, with a bureaucratic system, was introduced into the Indus Valley for the first time, establishing several satrapies: Gandāra around the general region of Gandhara, Hindush around Punjab and Sindh, Arachosia, encompassing parts of present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan,[29] Sattagydia around the Bannu basin,[30] and Gedrosia covering much of the Makran region of southern Balochistan.[31]\n\n\nWhat is known about the easternmost satraps and borderlands of the Achaemenid Empire is alluded to in the Darius inscriptions and from Greek sources such as the *Histories* of Herodotus and the later *Alexander Chronicles* (Arrian, Strabo et al.). These sources list three Indus Valley tributaries or conquered territories that were subordinated to the Persian Empire and made to pay tributes to the Persian Kings.[30]\n\n\n\n### Macedonian Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indian campaign of Alexander the Great and Macedonian Empire\n\n![](image)Alexander's campaigns in modern-day Pakistan\n![](image)Porus, with Alexander the Great\nBy spring of 326 BC, Alexander began on his Indus expedition from Bactria, leaving behind 3500 horses and 10,000 soldiers. He divided his army into two groups. The larger force would enter the Indus Valley through the Khyber Pass, just as Darius had done 200 years earlier, while a smaller force under the personal command of Alexander entered through a northern route, possibly through Broghol or Dorah Pass near Chitral. Alexander was commanding a group of shield-bearing guards, foot-companions, archers, Agrianians, and horse-javelin-men and led them against the tribes of the former Gandhara satrapy.\n\n\nThe first tribe they encountered were the Aspasioi tribe of the Kunar Valley, who initiated a fierce battle against Alexander, in which he himself was wounded in the shoulder by a dart. However, the Aspasioi eventually lost and 40,000 people were enslaved. Alexander then continued in a southwestern direction where he encountered the Assakenoi tribe of the Swat & Buner valleys in April 326 BC. The Assakenoi fought bravely and offered stubborn resistance to Alexander and his army in the cities of Ora, Bazira (Barikot) and Massaga. So enraged was Alexander about the resistance put up by the Assakenoi that he killed the entire population of Massaga and reduced its buildings to rubble – similar slaughters followed in Ora.[32] A similar slaughter then followed at Ora, another stronghold of the Assakenoi. The stories of these slaughters reached numerous Assakenians, who began fleeing to Aornos, a hill-fort located between Shangla and Kohistan. Alexander followed close behind their heels and besieged the strategic hill-fort, eventually capturing and destroying the fort and killing everyone inside. The remaining smaller tribes either surrendered or like the Astanenoi tribe of Pushkalavati (Charsadda) were quickly neutralized where 38,000 soldiers and 230,000 oxen were captured by Alexander.[33] Eventually Alexander's smaller force would meet with the larger force which had come through the Khyber Pass met at Attock. With the conquest of Gandhara complete, Alexander switched to strengthening his military supply line, which by now stretched dangerously vulnerable over the Hindu Kush back to Balkh in Bactria.\n\n\nAfter conquering Gandhara and solidifying his supply line back to Bactria, Alexander combined his forces with the King Ambhi of Taxila and crossed the River Indus in July 326 BC to begin the Archosia (Punjab) campaign. His first resistance would come at the River Jhelum near Bhera against King Porus of the Paurava tribe. The famous Battle of the Hydaspes (Jhelum) between Alexander (with Ambhi) and Porus would be the last major battle fought by him. After defeating Porus, his battle weary troops refused to advance into India[34] to engage the army of Nanda Dynasty and its vanguard of trampling elephants. Alexander, therefore proceeded south-west along the Indus Valley.[35] Along the way, he engaged in several battles with smaller kingdoms in Multan and Sindh, before marching his army westward across the Makran desert towards what is now Iran. In crossing the desert, Alexander's army took enormous casualties from hunger and thirst, but fought no human enemy. They encountered the \"Fish Eaters\", or Ichthyophagi, primitive people who lived on the Makran coast, who had matted hair, no fire, no metal, no clothes, lived in huts made of whale bones, and ate raw seafood.\n\n\n\n### Mauryan Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Maurya Empire, Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and Greco-Buddhism\n\n![](image)Territories of the Maurya Empire conceptualized as core areas or linear networks separated by large autonomous regions.\nThe Maurya Empire was a geographically extensive Iron Age historical power in South Asia based in Magadha, having been founded by Chandragupta Maurya in 322 BCE, and existing in loose-knit fashion until 185 BCE.[36] The Maurya Empire was centralized by the conquest of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and its capital city was located at Pataliputra (modern Patna). Outside this imperial center, the empire's geographical extent was dependent on the loyalty of military commanders who controlled the armed cities sprinkling it.[37][38][39] During Ashoka's rule (ca. 268–232 BCE) the empire briefly controlled the major urban hubs and arteries of the Indian subcontinent excepting the deep south.[36] It declined for about 50 years after Ashoka's rule, and dissolved in 185 BCE with the assassination of Brihadratha by Pushyamitra Shunga and foundation of the Shunga Empire in Magadha.\n\n\nChandragupta Maurya raised an army, with the assistance of Chanakya, author of Arthasastra,[40] and overthrew the Nanda Empire in c. 322 BCE. Chandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India by conquering the satraps left by Alexander the Great, and by 317 BCE the empire had fully occupied northwestern India.[41] The Mauryan Empire then defeated Seleucus I, a diadochus and founder of the Seleucid Empire, during the Seleucid–Mauryan war, thus acquiring territory west of the Indus River.[42][43]\n\n\nUnder the Mauryas, internal and external trade, agriculture, and economic activities thrived and expanded across South Asia due to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance, administration, and security. The Maurya dynasty built a precursor of the Grand Trunk Road from Patliputra to Taxila.[44] After the Kalinga War, the Empire experienced nearly half a century of centralized rule under Ashoka. Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism and sponsorship of Buddhist missionaries allowed for the expansion of that faith into Sri Lanka, northwest India, and Central Asia.[45]\n\n\nThe population of South Asia during the Mauryan period has been estimated to be between 15 and 30 million.[46] \nThe empire's period of dominion was marked by exceptional creativity in art, architecture, inscriptions and produced texts.[47]\n\n\n\n## Classical history – Middle Kingdoms[edit]\n\n\n### Indo-Greek Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indo-Greek Kingdom, Greco-Buddhist art, and Indo-Greek art\n\n![](image)Territory of the Indo-Greeks, circa 150 BC[48]\n![](image)Greco-Buddhist representation of the Buddha, seated to the left of a depiction of Vajrapani in the guise of the Hellenic god Heracles[49]\nThe Indo-Greek Menander I (reigned 155–130 BCE) drove the Greco-Bactrians out of Gandhara and beyond the Hindu Kush, becoming king shortly after his victory. His territories covered Panjshir and Kapisa in modern Afghanistan and extended to the Punjab region, with many tributaries to the south and east, possibly as far as Mathura. The capital Sagala (modern Sialkot) prospered greatly under Menander's rule and Menander is one of the few Bactrian kings mentioned by Greek authors.[50]\n\n\nThe classical Buddhist text Milinda Pañha praises Menander, saying there was \"none equal to Milinda in all India\".[51] His empire survived him in a fragmented manner until the last independent Greek king, Strato II, disappeared around 10 CE. Around 125 BCE, the Greco-Bactrian king Heliocles, son of Eucratides, fled from the Yuezhi invasion of Bactria and relocated to Gandhara, pushing the Indo-Greeks east of the Jhelum River. The last known Indo-Greek ruler was Theodamas, from the Bajaur area of Gandhara, mentioned on a 1st-century CE signet ring, bearing the Kharoṣṭhī inscription *\"Su Theodamasa\"* (*\"Su\"* was the Greek transliteration of the Kushan royal title *\"Shau\"* (\"Shah\" or \"King\")). Various petty kings ruled into the early 1st century CE, until the conquests by the Scythians, Parthians and the Yuezhi, who founded the Kushan dynasty.\n\n\nIt is during this period that the fusion of Hellenistic and Asiatic mythological, artistic and religious elements becomes most apparent, especially in the region of Gandhara, straddling western Pakistan and southern Afghanistan. Detailed, humanistic representations of the Buddha begin to emerge, depicting the figure with a close resemblance to the Hellenic god Apollo; Greek mythological motifs such as centaurs, Bacchanalian scenes, Nereids and deities such as Tyche and Heracles are prominent in the Buddhistic art of ancient Pakistan and Afghanistan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Indo-Scythian Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A stone palette of the type found in the Early Saka layer at Sirkap, Punjab\n![](image)Territories and expansion of the Indo-Scythians at their greatest extent, including territories of the Northern Satraps and Western Satraps.\nThe Indo-Scythians were descended from the Sakas (Scythians) who migrated from southern Central Asia into Pakistan and Arachosia from the middle of the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE. They displaced the Indo-Greeks and ruled a kingdom that stretched from Gandhara to Mathura. The power of the Saka rulers started to decline in the 2nd century CE after the Scythians were defeated by the south Indian Emperor Gautamiputra Satakarni of the Satavahana dynasty.[52][53] Later the Saka kingdom was completely destroyed by Chandragupta II of the Gupta Empire from eastern India in the 4th century.[54]\n\n\n\n### Indo-Parthian Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Apracharajas and Paratarajas\n\n![](image)Ancient Buddhist monastery Takht-i-Bahi (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) constructed by the Indo-Parthians\n![](image)Indo-Parthian Kingdom at its maximum extent, circa 40 CE, and neighbouring South Asian polities.[55]\nThe Indo-Parthian Kingdom was ruled by the Gondopharid dynasty, named after its eponymous first ruler Gondophares. They ruled parts of present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan,[56] and northwestern India, during or slightly before the 1st century AD. For most of their history, the leading Gondopharid kings held Taxila (in the present Punjab province of Pakistan) as their residence, but during their last few years of existence the capital shifted between Kabul and Peshawar. These kings have traditionally been referred to as Indo-Parthians, as their coinage was often inspired by the Arsacid dynasty, but they probably belonged to a wider groups of Iranic tribes who lived east of Parthia proper, and there is no evidence that all the kings who assumed the title *Gondophares*, which means \"Holder of Glory\", were even related. Christian writings claim that the Apostle Saint Thomas – an architect and skilled carpenter – had a long sojourn in the court of king Gondophares, had built a palace for the king at Taxila and had also ordained leaders for the Church before leaving for Indus Valley in a chariot, for sailing out to eventually reach Malabar Coast.\n\n\n\n### Kushan Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Kushan Empire, Kushan coinage, and Kanishka\n\n![](image)Peshawar's Kanishka stupa once kept sacred Buddhist relics in the Kanishka casket.\n![](image)A map of India in the 2nd century AD showing the extent of the Kushan Empire (in green) during the reign of Kanishka. Most historians consider the empire to have variously extended as far east as the middle Ganges plain,[57] to Varanasi on the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna,[58][59] or probably even Pataliputra.[60][61]\nThe Kushan Empire expanded out of what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the subcontinent under the leadership of their first emperor, Kujula Kadphises, about the middle of the 1st century CE. They were descended from an Indo-European, Central Asian people called the Yuezhi,[62][63] a branch of which was known as the Kushans. By the time of his grandson, Kanishka the Great, the empire spread to encompass much of Afghanistan[64] and the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent at least as far as Saketa and Sarnath near Varanasi (Benares).[65]\n\n\nEmperor Kanishka was a great patron of Buddhism; however, as Kushans expanded southward, the deities[66] of their later coinage came to reflect its new Hindu majority.[67] The monumental Kanishka stupa is believed to have been established by the king near the outskirts of modern-day Peshawar, Pakistan.\n\n\nThe Kushan dynasty played an important role in the establishment of Buddhism in India and its spread to Central Asia and China. Historian Vincent Smith said about Kanishka in particular:\n\n\n\n\n> He played the part of a second Ashoka in the history of Buddhism.[68]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe empire linked the Indian Ocean maritime trade with the commerce of the Silk Road through the Indus valley, encouraging long-distance trade, particularly between China and Rome. The Kushans brought new trends to the budding and blossoming Gandharan Art, which reached its peak during Kushan Rule.\n\n\nH.G. Rowlinson commented:\n\n\n\n\n> The Kushan period is a fitting prelude to the Age of the Guptas.[69]\n> \n> \n\n\nBy the 3rd century, their empire in India was disintegrating and their last known great emperor was Vasudeva I.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### Alchon Huns[edit]\n\n\nThe Alchon Empire was the third of four major Huna states established in Central and South Asia. The Alchon were preceded by the Kidarites and succeeded by the Hephthalites in Bactria and the Nezak Huns in the Hindu Kush. The names of the Alchon kings are known from their extensive coinage, Buddhist accounts, and a number of commemorative inscriptions throughout the Indian subcontinent. Toramana's son Mihirakula, a Saivite Hindu, moved up to near Pataliputra to the east and Gwalior to central India. Hiuen Tsiang narrates Mihirakula's merciless persecution of Buddhists and destruction of monasteries, though the description is disputed as far as the authenticity is concerned.[72] The Alchons have long been considered as a part or a sub-division of the Hephthalites, or as their eastern branch, but now tend to be considered as a separate entity.[73][74][75] The Huns were defeated by the alliance of Indian rulers, Maharaja (Great King) Yasodharman of Malwa and Gupta Emperor Narasimhagupta in the 6th century. Some of them were driven out of India and others were assimilated in the Indian society.[76]\n\n\n\n## Medieval period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The expansion of the Arab Caliphate. Expansion under Muhammad, 622–632\n Expansion during the Rashidun Caliphate, 632–661\n Expansion during the Umayyad Caliphate, 661–750\n\n### Arab Caliphate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Rashidun Caliphate and Umayyad Caliphate\n\nFurther information: Caliphate campaigns in India\n\nAfter conquering the Middle East from the Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Empire, the Rashidun Caliphate reached the coastal region of Makran in present-day Balochistan. In 643, the second caliph Umar (r. 634–644) ordered an invasion of Makran against the Rai dynasty. Following the Rashidun capture of Makran, Umar restricted the army to not pass beyond and consolidated his position in Makran.[77] During the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (r. 656–661), the Rashidun army conquered the town of Kalat in the heart of Balochistan.[78]\nDuring the reign of the sixth Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715), the Arab military general Muhammad ibn al-Qasim commanded the Umayyad incursion into Sindh. In 712, he defeated the army of the Hindu *maharaja* Dahir of Aror (r. 695–712) and established the caliphal province of Sind. The historic town of al-Mansura was administered as the capital of the province. Afterward, Ibn al-Qasim proceeded to conquer Multan, which subsequently became a prominent center of Islamic culture and trading. In 747, the anti-Umayyad rebel Mansur ibn Jumhur al-Kalbi seized Sind and was defeated by Musa ibn Ka'b al-Tamimi of the succeeding Abbasid Caliphate. In the 9th-century, Abbasid authority gradually declined in Sind and Multan. The tenth Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861) assigned the governorship of Sind to Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Habbari, who founded the hereditary Habbarid dynasty and became the autonomous ruler of Sind in 854. Around the same time, the Banu Munnabih established the Emirate of Multan while Ma'danids reigned over Sultanate of Makran. There was gradual conversion to Islam in the south, especially amongst the native Hindu and Buddhist majority, but in areas north of Multan, Hindus and Buddhists remained numerous.[79] By the end of the 10th century CE, the region was ruled by several Hindu kings.\n\n\n\n### Odi Shahis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Turk Shahis and Hindu Shahi\n\n![](image)Amb Temples, built by the Hindu Shahi dynasty between the 7th and 9th centuries CE\nThe Turk Shahis ruled Gandhara from the decline of the Kushan Empire in the 3rd century until 870, when they were overthrown by the Hindu Shahis. The Hindu Shahis are believed to belong to the Uḍi/Oḍi tribe, namely the people of Oddiyana in Gandhara.[80][81]\n\n\nThe first king Kallar had moved the capital into Udabandhapura from Kabul, in the modern village of Hund for its new capital.[82][83][84][85] At its zenith, the kingdom stretched over the Kabul Valley, Gandhara and western Punjab under Jayapala.[86] Jayapala saw a danger in the consolidation of the Ghaznavids and invaded their capital city of Ghazni both in the reign of Sebuktigin and in that of his son Mahmud, which initiated the Muslim Ghaznavid and Hindu Shahi struggles.[87] Sebuk Tigin, however, defeated him, and he was forced to pay an indemnity.[87] Jayapala defaulted on the payment and took to the battlefield once more.[87] Jayapala however, lost control of the entire region between the Kabul Valley and Indus River.[88]\n\n\nHowever, the army was defeated in battle against the western forces, particularly against the Mahmud of Ghazni.[88] In the year 1001, soon after Sultan Mahmud came to power and was occupied with the Qarakhanids north of the Hindu Kush, Jaipal attacked Ghazni once more and upon suffering yet another defeat by the powerful Ghaznavid forces, near present-day Peshawar. After the Battle of Peshawar, he died because of regretting as his subjects brought disaster and disgrace to the Shahi dynasty.[87][88]\n\n\nJayapala was succeeded by his son Anandapala,[87] who along with other succeeding generations of the Shahiya dynasty took part in various unsuccessful campaigns against the advancing Ghaznvids but were unsuccessful. The Hindu rulers eventually exiled themselves to the Kashmir Siwalik Hills.[88]\n\n\n\n### Ghaznavid dynasty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ghaznavids\n\n![](image)Ghaznavid Empire at its greatest extent in 1030 CE\nIn 997 CE, the Turkic ruler Mahmud of Ghazni, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sebuktegin, a Turkic origin ruler. Starting from the city of Ghazni (now in Afghanistan), Mehmood conquered the bulk of Khorasan, marched on Peshawar against the Hindu Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab (1007), deposed the Shia Ismaili rulers of Multan, (1011), Kashmir (1015) and Qanoch (1017). By the end of his reign in 1030, Mahmud's empire briefly extended from Kurdistan in the west to the Yamuna river in the east, and the Ghaznavid dynasty lasted until 1187. Contemporary historians such as Abolfazl Beyhaqi and Ferdowsi described extensive building work in Lahore, as well as Mahmud's support and patronage of learning, literature and the arts.\n\n\nMahmud's successors, known as the Ghaznavids, ruled for 157 years. Their kingdom gradually shrank in size, and was racked by bitter succession struggles. The Hindu Rajput kingdoms of western India reconquered the eastern Punjab, and by the 1160s, the line of demarcation between the Ghaznavid state and the Hindu kingdoms approximated to the present-day boundary between India and Pakistan. The Ghurid Empire of central Afghanistan occupied Ghazni around 1160, and the Ghaznavid capital was shifted to Lahore. Later Muhammad Ghori conquered the Ghaznavid kingdom, occupying Lahore in 1187.[89]\n\n\n\n### Ghurid dynasty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ghurid dynasty\n\n![](image)Map of Ghurid territory, before the assassination of Muhammad of Ghor.[90][91][92] In the west, Ghurid territory extended to Nishapur and Merv,[93][94] while Ghurid troops reached as far as Gorgan on the shores of the Caspian Sea.[95][96] Eastward, the Ghurids invaded as far as Bengal.[97]\nThe Ghaznavids under either Khusrau Shah or his son Khusrau Malik lost their control over Ghazni to the Ghuzz Turks along with some other territories. In the 1170s, Ghurid prince Muhammad of Ghor raided their territory and captured Ghazni from them and was crowned there by his brother Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad in 1173. Muhammad of Ghor marched from Gomal Pass into Pakistan and captured Multan and Uch before being rebuffed by Gujarat's Hindu Chaulukya (Solanki) rulers, which forced him to press upon the trumbling Ghaznavids. By 1186–87, he deposed the last Ghaznavid ruler Khusrau Malik, bringing the last of Ghaznevid territory under his control and ending the Ghaznavid empire. The Ghurids were overthrown in 1215, although their conquests in the Indian Subcontinent survived for several centuries under the Delhi Sultanate established by the Ghurid Mamluk Qutb ud-Din Aibak.\n\n\n\n### Delhi Sultanate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Delhi Sultanate\n\n![](image)Delhi Sultanate at its greatest extent, under the Tughlaq dynasty, 1330–1335.[98][99]\n![](image)Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam, built by Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq in 1324 CE\nThe Turkic origin Mamluk Dynasty, seized the throne of the Sultanate in 1211. Several dynasties ruled their empires from Delhi: the Mamluk (1211–90), the Khalji (1290–1320), the Tughlaq (1320–1413), the Sayyid (1414–1451) and the Lodhi (1451–1526).[100] Although some kingdoms remained independent of Delhi, almost all of the Indus plain came under the rule of these large sultanates.\n\n\nThe sultans (emperors) of Delhi enjoyed cordial relations with rulers in the Near East but owed them no allegiance. While the sultans ruled from urban centres, their military camps and trading posts provided the nuclei for many towns that sprang up in the countryside. Close interaction with local populations led to cultural exchange and the resulting \"Indo-Islamic\" fusion has left a lasting imprint and legacy in South Asian architecture, music, literature, life style and religious customs. In addition, the language of Urdu (literally meaning \"horde\" or \"camp\" in various Turkic dialects, but more likely \"city\" in the South Asian context) was born during the Delhi Sultanate period, as a result of the mingling of speakers of native Prakrits, Persian, Turkish and Arabic languages.\n\n\nPerhaps the greatest contribution of the Sultanate was its temporary success in insulating South Asia from the Mongol invasion from Central Asia in the 13th century; nonetheless the sultans eventually lost western Pakistan to the Mongols (see the Ilkhanate dynasty). The Sultanate declined after the invasion of Emperor Timur, who founded the Timurid Empire, and was eventually conquered in 1526 by the Mughal Emperor Babar.\n\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire attracted Muslim refugees, nobles, technocrats, bureaucrats, soldiers, traders, scientists, architects, artisans, teachers, poets, artists, theologians and Sufis from the rest of the Muslim world and they migrated and settled in the South Asia. During the reign of Sultan Ghyasuddin Balban (1266–1286) thousands of Central Asian Muslims sought asylum including more than 15 sovereigns and their nobles due to the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran. At the court of Sultan Iltemish in Delhi the first wave of these Muslim refugees escaping from the Central Asian genocide by the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan, brought administrators from Iran, painters from China, theologians from Samarkand, Nishapur and Bukhara, divines and saints from the rest of Muslim world, craftsmen and men and maidens from every region, notably doctors adept in Greek medicine and philosophers from everywhere.\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Sindh[edit]\n\n\n#### Soomra dynasty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Soomra dynasty\n\nThe Soomra dynasty was a local Sindhi Muslim dynasty that ruled between the early 11th century and the 14th century.[101][102][103]\n\n\nLater chroniclers like Ali ibn al-Athir (c. late 12th c.) and Ibn Khaldun (c. late 14th c.) attributed the fall of Habbarids to Mahmud of Ghazni, lending credence to the argument of Hafif being the last Habbarid.[104] The Soomras appear to have established themselves as a regional power in this power vacuum.[104][105]\n\n\nThe Ghurids and Ghaznavids continued to rule parts of Sindh, across the eleventh and early twelfth century, alongside Soomrus.[104] The precise delineations are not yet known but Sommrus were probably centered in lower Sindh.[104]\n\n\nSome of them were adherents of Isma'ilism.[105] One of their kings Shimuddin Chamisar had submitted to Iltutmish, the Sultan of Delhi, and was allowed to continue on as a vassal.[106]\n\n\n\n#### Samma dynasty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Samma dynasty\n\nMakli Necropolis\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Makli Necropolis at Thatta is one of the largest funerary sites in the world.[107]\n\nThe Samma dynasty was a Sindhi dynasty that ruled in Sindh, and parts of Kutch, Punjab and Balochistan from c. 1351 to c. 1524 CE, with their capital at Thatta.[108][109][110]\n\n\nThe Sammas overthrew the Soomra dynasty soon after 1335 and the last Soomra ruler took shelter with the governor of Gujarat, under the protection of Muhammad bin Tughluq, the sultan of Delhi. Mohammad bin Tughlaq made an expedition against Sindh in 1351 and died at Sondha, possibly in an attempt to restore the Soomras. With this, the Sammas became independent. The next sultan, Firuz Shah Tughlaq attacked Sindh in 1365 and 1367, unsuccessfully, but with reinforcements from Delhi he later obtained Banbhiniyo's surrender. For a period the Sammas were therefore subject to Delhi again. Later, as the Sultanate of Delhi collapsed they became fully independent.[111] Jam Unar was the founder of Samma dynasty mentioned by Ibn Battuta.[111]\n\n\nThe Samma civilization contributed significantly to the evolution of the Indo-Islamic architectural style. Thatta is famous for its necropolis, which covers 10 square km on the Makli Hill.[112] It has left its mark in Sindh with magnificent structures including the Makli Necropolis of its royals in Thatta.[108][113]\n\n\n\n## Early Modern Period[edit]\n\n\n### Mughal Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mughal Empire\n\nFurther information: Mughal Architecture, Mughal clothing, and Mughlai cuisine\n\n![](image)The empire at its greatest extent in c. 1700 under Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707)\nMughal Architecture in Pakistan\n![](image)\nShalimar Gardens at Lahore[114]\n![](image)\nThe Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore Fort was built during the reign of Aurangzeb.[114]\n![](image)\nDiwan-i-Khas at Lahore Fort was built during the reign of Shah Jahan.\n![](image)\nThe Badshahi Mosque, built by Aurangzeb, is one of the largest mosques in Pakistan.\n![](image)\nWazir Khan Mosque at Lahore, richly decorated with Mughal frescoes\n![](image)\nThe Akbari Sarai features a monumental gateway that leads to the Tomb of Jahangir.\n\nIn 1526, Babur, a Timurid descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan from Fergana Valley (modern-day Uzbekistan), swept across the Khyber Pass and founded the Mughal Empire, covering parts of modern-day eastern- Afghanistan, much of what is now Pakistan, parts of India and Bangladesh.[115] The Mughals were descended from Central Asian Turks (with significant Mongol admixture).\n\n\nHowever, his son and successor Humayun was defeated by Sher Shah Suri who was from Bihar state of India, in the year 1540, and Humayun was forced to retreat to Kabul. After Sher Shah died, his son Islam Shah Suri became the ruler, on whose death his prime minister, Hemu ascended the throne and ruled North India from Delhi for one month. He was defeated by Emperor Akbar's forces in the Second Battle of Panipat on 6 November 1556.\n\n\nAkbar, was both a capable ruler and an early proponent of religious and ethnic tolerance and favoured an early form of multiculturalism. For example, he declared \"Amari\" or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism and rolled back the *jizya* tax imposed upon non-Islamic mainly Hindu people. The Mughal dynasty ruled most of the South Asia by 1600. The Mughal emperors married local royalty and allied themselves with local *maharajas*. Akbar was succeeded by Jahangir who was succeeded by Shah Jahan. Shah Jahan was replaced by Aurangzeb following the Mughal war of succession (1658–1659).\n\n\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, different regions of modern Pakistan and India began asserting independence. The empire went into a rapid decline and by about 1720 only really controlled a small region around Delhi. The emperors continued have lip service paid to them as \"Emperor of India\" by the other powers in South Asia until the British finally abolished the empire in 1858.\n\n\nFor a short time in the late 16th century, Lahore was the capital of the empire. The architectural legacy of the Mughals includes the Lahore Fort, Wazir Khan Mosque, Shalimar Gardens, Tomb of Jahangir, Tomb of Nur Jahan, Akbari Sarai, Hiran Minar, Shah Jahan Mosque and the Badshahi Mosque.[114] The Mughal Empire had a great impact on the culture, cuisine, and architecture of Pakistan.\n\n\n\n### Decline of Mughal empire[edit]\n\n\nBy early 18th century, the Mughal empire declined. In 1749, the Mughals were induced to cede Sindh, the Punjab region and the important trans Indus River to Ahmad Shah Durrani in order to save his capital from Afghan attack.[116] Ahmad Shah sacked Delhi in 1757 but permitted the Mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control of the city as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah's suzerainty over Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir. Leaving his second son Timur Shah to safeguard his interests, Ahmad Shah left India to return to Afghanistan.\n\n\nIn 1751–52, *Ahamdiya* treaty was signed between the Marathas and Mughals, when Balaji Bajirao was the Peshwa.[117] Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled whole of India from their capital at Pune and the Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi (the Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao sent Raghunathrao. He defeated the Rohillas and Afghan garrisons in Punjab and succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule.[118] Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Ahmad was forced to return to India and face the Maratha Confederacy.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bala Hissar fort in Peshawar was one of the royal residences of the Durrani kings.\nIn 1758, the Maratha Empire's general Raghunath Rao attacked and conquered Punjab, frontier regions and Kashmir and drove out Timur Shah Durrani, the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali. In 1759, the Marathas and its allies won the Battle of Lahore, defeating the Durranis,[119][120] hence, Lahore, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Peshawar, Kashmir, and other subahs on the south eastern side of Afghanistan's border fell under the Maratha rule.[121]\n\n\nAhmad Shah declared a jihad (or Islamic holy war) against the Marathas, and warriors from various Afghan tribes joined his army. Early skirmishes were followed by decisive victory for the Afghans against the much larger Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad Shah and his army reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, Panipat was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of northern India. The Third Battle of Panipat (14 January 1761), fought between largely Muslim and largely Hindu armies was waged along a twelve-kilometer front. Although the Durrani's army decisively defeated the Marathas, they suffered heavily in the battle.\n\n\nThe victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah's—and Afghan—power. However, even prior to his death, the empire began to face challenges in the form of a rising Sikhs in Punjab. In 1762, Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to subdue the Sikhs. From this time and on, the domination and control of the Empire began to loosen, and by the time of Durrani's death he had completely lost Punjab to the Sikhs, as well as earlier losses of northern territories to the Uzbeks, necessitating a compromise with them.[122]\n\n\n\n### Sikh Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sikh Empire and History of Sikhism\n\n![](image)Samadhi of Ranjit Singh, with the minaret of Badshahi Mosque in the background\nGuru Nanak (29 November 1469 – 22 September 1539), Sikhism's founder, was born into a Hindu Khatri family in the village of *Rāi Bhōi dī Talwandī (*present day Nankana, near Sial in modern-day Pakistan). He was an influential religious and social reformer in north India and the saintly founder of a modern monotheistic order and first of the ten divine Gurus of Sikh religion. At the age of 70, he died at Kartarpur, Punjab of modern-day Pakistan.\n\n\nThe Sikh Empire (1799–1849) was formed on the foundations of the Sikh Khalsa Army by Maharaja Ranjit Singh who was proclaimed \"*Sarkar-i-Khalsa*\", and was referred to as the \"Maharaja of Lahore\".[123] It consisted of a collection of autonomous Punjabi Misls, which were governed by Misldars,[124] mainly in the Punjab region. The empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Multan in the south and Kapurthala in the east. The main geographical footprint of the empire was the Punjab region. The formation of the empire was a watershed and represented formidable consolidation of Sikh military power and resurgence of local culture, which had been dominated for hundreds of years by Indo-Afghan and Indo-Mughal hybrid cultures.\n\n\nThe foundations of the Sikh Empire, during the time of the Sikh Khalsa Army, could be defined as early as 1707, starting from the death of Aurangzeb. The fall of the Mughal Empire provided opportunities for the Sikh army to lead expeditions against the Mughals and Pashtuns. This led to a growth of the army, which was split into different Sikh armies and then semi-independent \"misls\". Each of these component armies were known as a misl, each controlling different areas and cities. However, in the period from 1762 to 1799, Sikh rulers of their misls appeared to be coming into their own. The formal start of the Sikh Empire began with the disbandment of the Sikh Khalsa Army by the time of coronation of Ranjit Singh in 1801, creating a unified political state. All the misl leaders who were affiliated with the Army were from Punjab's nobility.[124]\n\n\n\n## Colonial period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British raj, Indian independence movement, Partition of India, and British heritage of Pakistan\n\nIndo-Saracenic Revival architecture in Pakistan\n![](image)\nLahore Museum\n![](image)\nIslamia College, Peshawar\n![](image)\nSadiq Dane High School, Bahawalpur\n![](image)\nUniversity of the Punjab, Lahore\n\nNone of the territory of modern Pakistan was ruled by the British, or other European powers, until 1839, when Karachi, then a small fishing village with a mud fort guarding the harbour, was taken, and held as an enclave with a port and military base for the First Afghan War that soon followed. The rest of Sindh was taken in 1843, and in the following decades, first the East India Company, and then after the post-Sepoy Mutiny (1857–1858) direct rule of Queen Victoria of the British Empire, took over most of the country partly through wars, and also treaties. The main wars were that against the Baloch Talpur dynasty, ended by the Battle of Miani (1843) in Sindh, the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849) and the Anglo-Afghan Wars (1839–1919). By 1893, all modern Pakistan was part of the British Indian Empire, and remained so until independence in 1947.\n\n\nUnder the British, modern Pakistan was mostly divided into the Sind Division, Punjab Province, and the Baluchistan Agency. There were various princely states, of which the largest was Bahawalpur. Sindh was part of the Bombay Presidency, and there were many complaints over the years that it was neglected by its distant rulers in modern Mumbai, although there was usually a Commissioner based in Karachi.\n\n\nThe Punjab (which included the modern Indian state) was instead technically ruled from even more distant Calcutta, as part of the Bengal Presidency, but in practice most matters were devolved to local British officials, who were often among the most energetic and effective in India. At first there was a \"Board of Administration\" led by Sir Henry Lawrence, who had previously worked as British Resident at the Lahore Durbar and also consisted of his younger brother John Lawrence and Charles Grenville Mansel.[125] Below the Board worked a group of acclaimed officers collectively known as Henry Lawrence's \"Young Men\". After the Mutiny, Sir John Lawrence became the first Governor of Punjab. The Punjab Canal Colonies were an ambitious and largely successful project, begun in the 1880s, to create new farmland through irrigation, to relieve population pressure elsewhere (most of the areas involved are now in Pakistan).\n\n\nThe Baluchistan Agency largely consisted of princely states and tribal territories, and was governed with a light touch, although near the Afghan border Quetta was built up as a military base, in case of invasion by either the Afghans or the Russians. The 1935 Quetta earthquake was a major disaster. From 1876 the sensitive far north was made a \"Chief Commissioner's Province\". The border with Afghanistan, which remains the modern border of Pakistan, was finally fixed on the Durand Line in 1893.\n\n\nRailway construction began in the 1850s, and most of the network (some now discontinued) was completed by 1900. Karachi expanded enormously under British rule, followed to a lesser extent by Lahore and the other larger cities.\n\n\nDifferent Regions of Pakistan were conquered by East India Company as below:  \n\n•Sindh was conquered by Battle of Hyderabad and Battle of Miani in 1843.  \n\n•Punjab and eastern Khyber pakhtunkhwa were conquered during Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849.\n\n\nRegions conquered by British Raj are as below:  \n\n•Southern Balochistan came under control by Treaty of Kalat in 1876.  \n\n•Western Balochistan was conquered by British empire in Second Anglo-Afghan War through Treaty of Gandamak, in 1879.\n\n\n\n### Early period of Pakistan Movement[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: All-India Muslim League, Pakistan Movement, and Lahore Resolution\n\nIn 1877, Syed Ameer Ali had formed the *Central National Muhammadan Association* to work towards the political advancement of the Indian Muslims, who had suffered grievously in 1857, in the aftermath of the failed Sepoy Mutiny against the East India Company; the British were seen as foreign invaders. But the organization declined towards the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lord Minto met with the Muslim delegation in June 1906. The Minto-Morley Reforms of 1909 called for separate Muslim electorates.\nIn 1885, the Indian National Congress was founded as a forum, which later became a party, to promote a nationalist cause.[126] Although the Congress attempted to include the Muslim community in the struggle for independence from the British rule – and some Muslims were very active in the Congress – the majority of Muslim leaders, including the influential Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, did not trust the party.\n\n\nA turning point came in 1900, when the British administration in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh acceded to Hindu demands and made Hindi, the version of the Hindustani language written in the Devanagari script, the official language. The proselytisation conducted in the region by the activists of a new Hindu reformist movement also stirred Muslim's concerns about their faith. Eventually, the Muslims feared that the Hindu majority would seek to suppress the rights of Muslims in the region following the departure of the British.\n\n\n\n### Muslim League[edit]\n\n\nThe All-India Muslim League was founded by Shaiiq-e-Mustafa on 30 December 1906, in the aftermath of division of Bengal, on the sidelines of the annual All India Muhammadan Educational Conference in Shahbagh, Dhaka East Bengal.[127] The meeting was attended by three thousand delegates and presided over by Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk. It addressed the issue of safeguarding interests of Muslims and finalised a programme. A resolution, moved by Nawab Salimullah and seconded by Hakim Ajmal Khan. Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk (conservative), declared:\n\n\n\n\n> The Musalmans are only a fifth in number as compared with the total population of the country, and it is manifest that if at any remote period the British government ceases to exist in India, then the rule of India would pass into the hands of that community which is nearly four times as large as ourselves ... our life, our property, our honour, and our faith will all be in great danger, when even now that a powerful British administration is protecting its subjects, we the Musalmans have to face most serious difficulties in safe-guarding our interests from the grasping hands of our neighbors.[128]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe constitution and principles of the League were contained in the *Green Book*, written by Maulana Mohammad Ali. Its goals at this stage did not include establishing an independent Muslim state, but rather concentrated on protecting Muslim liberties and rights, promoting understanding between the Muslim community and other Indians, educating the Muslim and Indian community at large on the actions of the government, and discouraging violence. However, several factors over the next thirty years, including sectarian violence, led to a re-evaluation of the League's aims.[129][130] Among those Muslims in the Congress who did not initially join the League was Jinnah, a prominent statesman and barrister in Bombay. This was because the first article of the League's platform was \"To promote among the Mussalmans (Muslims) of India, feelings of loyalty to the British Government\". The League remained loyal to the British administration for five years until the British decided to reverse the partition of Bengal. The Muslim League saw this British decision as partial to Hindus.[131]\n\n\n\n![](image)George VI, Emperor of India\nIn 1907, a vocal group of Hindu hard-liners within the Indian National Congress movement separated from it and started to pursue a pro-Hindu movement openly. This group was spearheaded by the famous triumvirate of Lal-Bal-Pal – Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal of Punjab, Bombay and Bengal provinces respectively. Their influence spread rapidly among other like minded Hindus – they called it Hindu nationalism – and it became a cause of serious concern for Muslims.\nHowever, Jinnah did not join the League until 1913, when the party changed its platform to one of Indian independence, as a reaction against the British decision to reverse the 1905 Partition of Bengal, which the League regarded it as a betrayal of the Bengali Muslims.[132] After vociferous protests of the Hindu population and violence engineered by secret groups, such as Anushilan Samiti and its offshoot Jugantar of Aurobindo and his brother etc., the British had decided to reunite Bengal again. Till this stage, Jinnah believed in Mutual co-operation to achieve an independent, united 'India', although he argued that Muslims should be guaranteed one-third of the seats in any Indian Parliament.\n\n\n\n![](image)Allama Sir Muhammad Iqbal\nThe League gradually became the leading representative body of Indian Muslims. Jinnah became its president in 1916, and negotiated the Lucknow Pact with the Congress leader, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, by which Congress conceded the principle of separate electorates and weighted representation for the Muslim community.[133] However, Jinnah broke with the Congress in 1920 when the Congress leader, Mohandas Gandhi, launched a law violating Non-Cooperation Movement against the British, which a temperamentally law-abiding barrister Jinnah disapproved of. Jinnah also became convinced that the Congress would renounce its support for separate electorates for Muslims, which indeed it did in 1928. In 1927, the British proposed a constitution for India as recommended by the Simon Commission, but they failed to reconcile all parties. The British then turned the matter over to the League and the Congress, and in 1928 an All-Parties Congress was convened in Delhi. The attempt failed, but two more conferences were held, and at the Bombay conference in May, it was agreed that a small committee should work on the constitution. The prominent Congress leader Motilal Nehru headed the committee, which included two Muslims, Syed Ali Imam and Shoaib Quereshi; Motilal's son, Pt Jawaharlal Nehru, was its secretary. The League, however, rejected the committee's report, the so-called Nehru Report, arguing that its proposals gave too little representation (one quarter) to Muslims – the League had demanded at least one-third representation in the legislature. Jinnah announced a \"parting of the ways\" after reading the report, and relations between the Congress and the League began to sour.\n\n\n\n### Muslim homeland – \"*Now or Never*\"[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pakistan Declaration; Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?; and United Kingdom general election, 1929\n\n![](image)Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman seconding the Resolution with Jinnah and Ali Khan presiding the session\nThe general elections held in the United Kingdom had already weakened the leftist Labour Party led by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.[134] Furthermore, the Labour Party's government was already weakened by the outcomes of World War I, which fueled new hopes for progress towards self-government in British India.[134] In fact, Mohandas K. Gandhi traveled to London to press the idea of \"self-government\" in British India, and claimed to represent all Indians whilst duly criticized the Muslim League as being sectarian and divisive.[134] After reviewing the report of the Simon Commission, the Indian Congress initiated a massive Civil Disobedience Movement under Gandhi; the Muslim League reserved their opinion on the Simon Report declaring that the report was not final and the matters should be decided after consultations with the leaders representing all communities in India.[134]\n\n\nThe Round-table Conferences was held, but these achieved little, since Gandhi and the League were unable to reach a compromise.[134] Witnessing the events of the Round Table Conferences, Jinnah had despaired of politics and particularly of getting mainstream parties like the Congress to be sensitive to minority priorities. During this time in 1930, notable writer and poet, Muhammad Iqbal called for a separate and autonomous nation-state, who in his presidential address to the 1930 convention of the Muslim League said that he felt that a separate Muslim state was essential in an otherwise Hindu-dominated South Asia.[135][136]\n\n\n\n\n> India is a continent of human groups belonging to different races, speaking different languages, and professing different religions [...] Personally, I would like to see the Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sind and Baluchistan amalgamated into a single state. Self-government within the British Empire, or without the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated North-West Indian Muslim State appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of North-West India.\n> \n> — Muhammad Iqbal, Allahabad Address\n> \n\n![](image)Dream of Iqbal and Ali's *Now or Never* idealized the merger of the four provinces into a nation-state, called Pakistan.\nThe name of the nation-state was coined by the Cambridge University's political science student and Muslim nationalist Rahmat Ali,[137] and was published on 28 January 1933 in the pamphlet *Now or Never*.[138] After coining the name of the nation-state, Ali noticed that there is an acronym formed from the names of the \"homelands\" of Muslims in northwest India:\n\n\n\n* \"**P**\" for **P**unjab\n* \"**A**\" for **A**fghania (now known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)\n* \"**K**\" for **K**ashmir\n* \"**S**\" for **S**indh\n* \"**Tan**\" for Balochis**tan**; thus forming \"Pakistan\".[139][140]\n\n\nAfter the publication of the pamphlet, the Hindu Press vehemently criticized it, and the word 'Pakstan' used in it.[141] Thus this word became a heated topic of debate. With the addition of an \"i\" to improve the pronunciation, the name of Pakistan grew in popularity and led to the commencement of the Pakistan Movement, and consequently the creation of Pakistan.[142]\nIn Urdu and Persian languages, the name encapsulates the concept of *Pak* (\"pure\") and *stan* (\"land\") and hence a \"Pure Land\".[143] In 1935, the British government proposed to hand over substantial power to elected Indian provincial legislatures, with elections to be held in 1937.[144] After the elections the League took office in Bengal and Punjab, but the Congress won office in most of the other provinces, and refused to devolve power with the League in provinces with large Muslim minorities citing technical difficulties. The subsequent Congress Rule was unpopular among Muslims and seen as a reign of Hindu tyranny by Muslim leaders. Mohammad Ali Jinnah declared 22 December 1939, a \"Day of Deliverance\" for Indian Muslims. It was meant to celebrate the resignation of all members of the Congress party from provincial and central offices.[145]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Muslim ideologues for independence also felt vindicated by the presidential address of V.D. Savarkar at the 19th session of the famous Hindu nationalist party Hindu Mahasabha in 1937. In it, this legendary revolutionary – popularly called Veer Savarkar and known as the iconic father of the Hindu fundamentalist ideology – propounded the seminal ideas of his Two Nation Theory or ethnic exclusivism, which influenced Jinnah profoundly.\n\n\n\n### 1940 Resolution[edit]\n\n\nIn 1940, Jinnah called a general session of the Muslim League in Lahore to discuss the situation that had arisen due to the outbreak of World War II and the Government of India joining the war without consulting Indian leaders. The meeting was also aimed at analyzing the reasons that led to the defeat of the Muslim League in the general election of 1937 in the Muslim majority provinces. In his speech, Jinnah criticized the Indian Congress and the nationalists, and espoused the Two-Nation Theory and the reasons for the demand for separate homelands.[146] Sikandar Hayat Khan, the Chief Minister of Punjab, drafted the original resolution, but disavowed the final version,[147] that had emerged after protracted redrafting by the Subject Committee of the Muslim League. The final text unambiguously rejected the concept of a United India because of increasing inter-religious violence[99] and recommended the creation of independent states.[148] The resolution was moved in the general session by *Shere-Bangla* Bengali nationalist, AKF Haq, the Chief Minister of Bengal, supported by Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman and other leaders and was adopted on 23 March 1940.[149] The Resolution read as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> No constitutional plan would be workable or acceptable to the Muslims unless geographical contiguous units are demarcated into regions which should be so constituted with such territorial readjustments as may be necessary. That the areas in which the Muslims are numerically in majority as in the North-Western and Eastern zones of India should be grouped to constitute independent states in which the constituent units shall be autonomous and sovereign ... That adequate, effective and mandatory safeguards shall be specifically provided in the constitution for minorities in the units and in the regions for the protection of their religious, cultural, economic, political, administrative and other rights of the minorities, with their consultation. Arrangements thus should be made for the security of Muslims where they were in a minority.[150]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)The Working Committee of the Muslim League in Lahore (1940)\n### Final phase of the Pakistan Movement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Karachi War Cemetery. About 87,000 soldiers from British India (which includes modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) died in World War II. Millions of civilians also died due to famines.\nImportant leaders in the Muslim League highlighted that Pakistan would be a 'New Medina', in other words the second Islamic state established after Muhammad's creation of an Islamic state in Medina. Pakistan was popularly envisaged as an Islamic utopia, a successor to the defunct Turkish Caliphate and a leader and protector of the entire Islamic world. Islamic scholars debated over whether it was possible for the proposed Pakistan to truly become an Islamic state.[151][152]\n\n\nWhile the Congress' top leadership had been in prison following the 1942 Quit India Movement, there was intense debate among Indian Muslims over the creation of a separate homeland.[152] The majority of Barelvis[153] and Barelvi ulema supported the creation of Pakistan[154] and *pirs* and Sunni ulema were mobilized by the Muslim League to demonstrate that India's Muslim masses wanted a separate country.[155] The Barelvis believed that any co-operation with Hindus would be counter productive.[156] On the other hand, most Deobandis, who were led by Maulana Husain Ahmad Madani, were opposed to the creation of Pakistan and the two-nation theory. According to them Muslims and Hindus could be one nation and Muslims were only a nation of themselves in the religious sense and not in the territorial sense.[157][158][159] At the same time some Deobandi ulema such as Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi, Mufti Muhammad Shafi and Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani were supportive of the Muslim League's demand to create a separate Pakistan.[155][160]\n\n\nMuslims who were living in provinces where they were demographically a minority, such as the United Provinces where the Muslim League enjoyed popular support, were assured by Jinnah that they could remain in India, migrate to Pakistan or continue living in India but as Pakistani citizens.\n\n\nIn the Constituent Assembly elections of 1946, the Muslim League won 425 out of 496 seats reserved for Muslims (polling 89.2% of total votes).[132] The Congress had hitherto refused to acknowledge the Muslim League's claim of being the representative of Indian Muslims but finally acquiesced to the League's claim after the results of this election. The Muslim League's demand for Pakistan had received overwhelming popular support from India's Muslims, especially those Muslims who were living in provinces such as UP where they were a minority.[161]\n\n\nThe British had neither the will, nor the financial resources or military power, to hold India any longer but they were also determined to avoid partition and for this purpose they arranged the Cabinet Mission Plan.[162] According to this plan India would be kept united but would be heavily decentralized with separate groupings of Hindu and Muslim majority provinces. The Muslim League accepted this plan as it contained the 'essence' of Pakistan but the Congress rejected it. After the failure of the Cabinet Mission Plan, Jinnah called for Muslims to observe Direct Action Day to demand the creation of a separate Pakistan. The Direct Action Day morphed into violent riots between Hindus and Muslims in Calcutta, with the violence displaying elements of ethnic cleansing. The riots in Calcutta were followed by intense communal rioting elsewhere, including in Noakhali (where Hindus were attacked by Muslims) and Bihar (where Hindus attacked Muslims) in October, resulting in large-scale displacement. In March 1947, such violence reached Punjab, where Sikhs and Hindus were massacred and driven out by Muslims in the Rawalpindi Division.[163]\n\n\nThe British Prime Minister Attlee appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten as India's last viceroy, to negotiate the independence of Pakistan and India and immediate British withdrawal. British leaders including Mountbatten did not support the creation of Pakistan but failed to convince Jinnah otherwise.[164][165] Mountbatten later confessed that he would most probably have sabotaged the creation of Pakistan had he known that Jinnah was dying of tuberculosis.[166]\n\n\nIn early 1947 the British had announced their desire to grant India its independence by June 1948. However, Lord Mountbatten decided to advance the date. In a meeting in June, Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad representing the Congress, Jinnah representing the Muslim League, B. R. Ambedkar representing the Untouchable community, and Master Tara Singh representing the Sikhs, agreed to partition India along religious lines.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Independence from the British Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indian Independence Act 1947, Independence Day (Pakistan), Partition of India, and Pakistan Movement\n\nOn 14 August 1947 Pakistan gained independence. India gained independence the following day. The two provinces of British India: Punjab and Bengal were divided along religious lines by the Radcliffe Commission. Mountbatten is alleged to have influenced the Radcliffe Commission to draw the line in India's favour.[167][168] Punjab's mostly Muslim western part went to Pakistan and its mostly Hindu/Sikh eastern part went to India but there were significant Muslim minorities in Punjab's eastern section and likewise there were many Hindus and Sikhs living in Punjab's western areas.\n\n\nIntense communal rioting in the Punjab forced the governments of India and Pakistan to agree to a forced population exchange of Muslim and Hindu/Sikh minorities living in Punjab. After this population exchange only a few thousand low-caste Hindus remained in Pakistan's side of Punjab and only a tiny Muslim population remained in the town of Malerkotla in India's part of Punjab.[169] Political scientist Ishtiaq Ahmed says that although Muslims started the violence in Punjab, by the end of 1947 more Muslims had been killed by Hindus and Sikhs in East Punjab than the number of Hindus and Sikhs who had been killed by Muslims in West Punjab.[170][171]\n\n\nMore than ten million people migrated across the new borders and between 200,000 and 2,000,000[172][173][174] people died in the spate of communal violence in the Punjab in what some scholars have described as a 'retributive genocide' between the religions.[175] The Pakistani government claimed that 50,000 Muslim women were abducted and raped by Hindu and Sikh men and similarly the Indian government claimed that Muslims abducted and raped 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women.[176][177][178] The two governments agreed to repatriate abducted women and thousands of Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women were repatriated to their families in the 1950s. The dispute over Kashmir escalated into the first war between India and Pakistan. The conflict remains unresolved.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)History portal\n* ![flag](image)Pakistan portal\n\n\n* History of Asia\n* History of South Asia\n* Islam in Pakistan\n* List of presidents of Pakistan\n* List of prime ministers of Pakistan\n* Meluhha\n* Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent\n* Politics of Pakistan\n* Timeline of Karachi\n* Timeline of Lahore\n* Timeline of Peshawar\n* Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Archaeological cultures identified with phases of Vedic culture include the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture, the Gandhara Grave culture, the Black and red ware culture and the Painted Grey Ware culture.[13]\n2. **^** The precise time span of the period is uncertain.

Prehistoric and protohistoric exchanges across the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalaya ranges demonstrate earlier precedents for routes through the high mountain passes and river valleys in later historical periods. Typological similarities between Northern Neolithic sites in Kashmir and Swat and sites in the Tibetan plateau and northern China show that 'Mountain chains have often integrated rather than isolated peoples.' Ties between the trading post of Shortughai in Badakhshan (northeastern Afghanistan) and the lower Indus valley provide evidence for long-distance commercial networks and 'polymorphous relations' across the Hindu Kush until c. 1800 B.C.' The Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) may have functioned as a 'filter' for the introduction of Indo-Iranian languages to the northwestern Indian subcontinent, although routes and chronologies remain hypothetical.

Finally, the longevity of the site, and its articulation with the neighbouring site of Nausharo (c. 2800—2000 BCE), provides a very clear continuity from South Asia's first farming villages to the emergence of its first cities (Jarrige, 1984).\"\n7. **^** Fisher, Michael H.

Then, under Chandragupta Maurya (c.321–297 bce), and subsequently Ashoka his grandson, Pataliputra became the centre of the loose-knit Mauryan 'Empire' which during Ashoka's reign (c.268–232 bce) briefly had a presence throughout the main urban centres and arteries of the subcontinent, except for the extreme south.\"\n37. **^** \nLudden, David (2013), *India and South Asia: A Short History*, Oneworld Publications, pp. 29–30, ISBN 978-1-78074-108-6 |quote=The geography of the Mauryan Empire resembled a spider with a small dense body and long spindly legs. The highest echelons of imperial society lived in the inner circle composed of the ruler, his immediate family, other relatives, and close allies, who formed a dynastic core. Outside the core, empire travelled stringy routes dotted with armed cities. Outside the palace, in the capital cities, the highest ranks in the imperial elite were held by military commanders whose active loyalty and success in war determined imperial fortunes. Wherever these men failed or rebelled, dynastic power crumbled. ... Imperial society flourished where elites mingled; they were its backbone, its strength was theirs. Kautilya's *Arthasastra* indicates that imperial power was concentrated in its original heartland, in old *Magadha*, where key institutions seem to have survived for about seven hundred years, down to the age of the Guptas. Here, Mauryan officials ruled local society, but not elsewhere. In provincial towns and cities, officials formed a top layer of royalty; under them, old conquered royal families were not removed, but rather subordinated. In most *janapadas*, the Mauryan Empire consisted of strategic urban sites connected loosely to vast hinterlands through lineages and local elites who were there when the Mauryas arrived and were still in control when they left.\n38. **^** Hermann Kulke 2004, pp. xii, 448.\n39. **^** Thapar, Romila (1990). *A History of India, Volume 1*.

It was the power of the big zamindars in Punjab and Sindh behind the Muslim League candidates, and the powerful campaign among the poor peasants of Bengal on economic issues of rural indebtedness and zamindari abolition, that led to this massive landslide victory (Alavi 2002, 14). Even Congress, which had always denied the League's claim to be the only true representative of Indian Muslims had to concede the truth of that claim. The 1946 election was, in effect, a plebiscite among Muslims on Pakistan.\n162. **^** Barbara D. Metcalf; Thomas R. Metcalf (2002). *A Concise History of India*.

Over 100,000 people were made homeless. They were also present in the wave of violence that rippled out from Calcutta to Bihar, where there were high Muslim casualty figures, and to Noakhali deep in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta of Bengal. Concerning the Noakhali riots, one British officer spoke of a 'determined and organized' Muslim effort to drive out all the Hindus, who accounted for around a fifth of the total population. Similarly, the Punjab counterparts to this transition of violence were the Rawalpindi massacres of March 1947. The level of death and destruction in such West Punjab villages as Thoa Khalsa was such that communities couldn't live together in its wake.\n164. **^** McGrath, Allen (1996). *The Destruction of Pakistan's Democracy*.

When Mountbatten was asked by Collins and Lapierre if he would have sabotaged Pakistan if he had known that Jinnah was dying of tuberculosis, his answer was instructive. There was no doubt in his mind about the legality or morality of his position on Pakistan. 'Most probably,' he said (1982:39).\n167. **^** \n\"K. Z.

The horrific statistics that surround women refugees-between 75,000–100,000 Hindu, Muslim and Sikh women who were abducted by men of the other communities, subjected to multiple rapes, mutilations, and, for some, forced marriages and conversions-is matched by the treatment of the abducted women in the hands of the nation-state. In the Constituent Assembly in 1949 it was recorded that of the 50,000 Muslim women abducted in India, 8,000 of then were recovered, and of the 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women abducted, 12,000 were recovered.\n178. **^** Abraham, Taisha (2002). *Women and the Politics of Violence*.
