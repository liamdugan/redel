Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.[6]\n\n\nOriginally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[7] However, the event retained the *Tokyo 2020* branding for marketing purposes.[8] It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators.[c] The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.[10]\n\n\nThe Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[d] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year[12] and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\n\n\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.[13]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals.[14][15][16] Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe three candidate cities were Tokyo, Istanbul, and Madrid. The applicant cities of Baku and Doha were not promoted to candidate status. A bid from Rome was withdrawn.[20]\n\n\n\n### Host city selection[edit]\n\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system.[20] None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 Summer Olympics host city election[21]\n| City\n | Team\n | Round 1\n | Runoff\n | Round 2\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | **42** | —\n | **60** |\n| Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey | 26\n | **49** | 36\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | 26\n | 45\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: COVID-19 cases at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics and List of athletes not attending the 2020 Summer Olympics due to COVID-19 concerns\n\nSee also: COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports\n\n![](image)Few pedestrians on the Shibuya Crossing during the state of emergency in the middle of Japan's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, early 2020\nIn January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Summer Olympic Games.[22] Tokyo organizers and the International Olympic Committee insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics.[23] The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \"made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest\".[24] Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event.[22] Also unlike the case for H1N1 \"swine flu\" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020.[25] In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[26] Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate.[27] In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed Games in their state, while John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19.[28][29]\n\n\nEstimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University predicted that states of emergency might be required during the Games.[30] The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts' panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the Games were to allow spectators.[31]\n\n\n\n### Qualifying event cancellation and postponement[edit]\n\n\nConcerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China.[32] The Asia & Oceania boxing qualification tournament, which was originally planned to be held from 3–14 February in Wuhan, China (the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March.[33] The third round of the women's football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia.[34] The European boxing qualification began on 14 March 2020 in London, United Kingdom, but was suspended after two days of competition before being rescheduled for April 2021.[35][36] It eventually resumed in June 2021 but was moved to Paris, France,[37] because of renewed concerns over travel to the United Kingdom. Other qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and mid-2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo.[38]\n\n\n\n### Effect on doping tests[edit]\n\n\nMandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that public health and safety were their topmost priorities.[39] The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3 February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the end of the month,[40] and the anti-doping organizations in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced their testing activities by the end of March.[39]\n\n\n\n### Postponement to 2021[edit]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) released a statement on 2 March 2020, confirming that preparations for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics were \"continuing as planned\".[41] On 23 March, both Canada and Australia indicated that they would withdraw from the Games if they were not postponed by a year.[42] On the same day, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated he would support a proposed postponement, citing that ensuring athlete safety was \"paramount,\" and veteran IOC member and former vice president Dick Pound said that he expected the Games to be postponed.[43][44]\n\n\nOn 24 March 2020, 122 days to go for the planned start, the IOC, TOCOG and prime minister Abe released a joint statement announcing that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be rescheduled to a date \"beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021\". They stated that the Games could \"stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times\", and that the Olympic flame could become \"the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present\".[45] Prime Minister Abe stated that IOC president Thomas Bach responded \"with 100% agreement\" to his proposal to delay the Games. For continuity and marketing purposes, it was agreed that the Games would still be branded as Tokyo 2020 despite the change in schedule.[8]\n\n\nOn 30 March 2020, the IOC and TOCOG announced that they had reached an agreement on the new dates for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which would now begin with the opening ceremony on 23 July 2021 and end with the closing ceremony on 8 August 2021, still to be held in Tokyo.[46][47] The subsequent Winter Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to begin on 4 February 2022, less than six months later. Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named \"Here We Go\" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots.[48]\n\n\n\n### Calls for cancellation[edit]\n\n\nHealth experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist.[49] In an interview, the then president of TOCOG and former Japanese prime minister, Yoshirō Mori, asserted that the Games would be \"scrapped\" if they could not go ahead in 2021.[50] On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games \"must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic\".[51] Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20 May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was \"a mammoth task\" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021.[52] However, both Mori and Bach expressed optimism about the Games going ahead.[50][52]\n\n\nA member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a *British Medical Journal* editorial, which stated, \"holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes—ignoring scientific and moral imperatives—is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security\".[53]\n\n\nOn 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had \"privately concluded\" that the Games would have to be cancelled.[54] The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were \"categorically untrue\".[55] The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19 February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled.[56] It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan.[57][58]\n\n\nPublic support for the Games in Japan decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.[59] Multiple organizations of medical professionals voiced oppositions to the Games,[53][60][61] while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement.[62] In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games.[63] The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association called for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo \"have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity\" in an open letter to the prime minister.[64] At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games.[65] Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement.[66]\n\n\nKenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected more than 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to \"prioritise life\" over the Olympics.[67] Japanese writers Jiro Akagawa[68][69] and Fuminori Nakamura also called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled.[70]\n\n\nOn 26 May 2021, the *Asahi Shimbun* newspaper, which was a local sponsor of the Games, published an editorial calling for Prime Minister Suga to \"calmly and objectively assess the situation and decide on the cancellation of the event this summer.\"[71] On 4 June it was reported that Japanese sponsors proposed to the organisers for \"the Games to be postponed for several months,\" citing a comment by a corporate sponsor senior executive: \"It just makes much, much more sense from our perspective to hold the Games when there are more vaccinated people, the weather is cooler and maybe public opposition is lower.\"[72]\n\n\nIn July 2021, it was announced that all events in Tokyo were to be held behind closed doors with no spectators due to a new state of emergency. A poll by the *Asahi Shimbun* found that 55% of those surveyed supported the cancellation of the Olympics, and 68% felt that organisers would not be able to suitably control COVID-19 at the Games.[73] The decision was also detrimental to local sponsors, which had planned in-person presences to promote their products during the Games; an executive of official sponsor Toyota stated that the company had pulled a television advertising campaign it had planned for the Games in Japan, citing that the Olympics were \"becoming an event that has not gained the public's understanding.\"[73][74]\n\n\nHad the games been cancelled, it would have been the first time since World War II that an Olympic event had been called off and the first games to be scrapped due to circumstances unrelated to war.[e] A complete cancellation would have also cost Japan ¥4.52 trillion (US$41.5 billion), based on operating expenses and loss of tourism activity due to Japan which had closed its international borders to foreign travellers since March 2020, did not eventually reopen until October 2022, and was initially scheduled to end preventive border measures in May 2023 but had moved early at the end of April of that year, less than two years after the Games ended.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Costs and insurance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an estimate conducted by professor emeritus Katsuhiro Miyamoto of Kansai University and reported by the NHK in March 2020, the cost of delaying the 2020 Olympics by one year would be 640.8 billion yen (US$5.8 billion), taking maintenance expenditures for the unused facilities into account.[75]\n\n\nThe Nomura Research Institute estimated that cancelling the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021 would cost around 1.81 trillion yen ($17 billion), less than the economic damages projected if another state of emergency is declared, noting that a decision to hold the games \"should be made based on the impact on infection risks, not from the standpoint of economic loss\".[77]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Games were protected through the commercial insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London, by global reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re. The IOC takes out around $800 million of insurance for each Summer Olympics, with the total amount of loss insured for the 2020 Games likely to be more than $2 billion.[*needs update*] The disruption caused by postponing the Games was covered by the insurance policy, with those likely to make claims for their financial losses including local organizers, sponsors, hospitality firms, and travel providers.[78][79][*needs update*]\n\n\nHolders of tickets purchased from overseas prior to postponement were entitled to refunds for both Olympic and Paralympic ticket purchases, except for the costs of cancelled hotel bookings. Although about 600,000 Olympic tickets and 300,000 Paralympic tickets were eligible to be refunded, organizers said that they would not release the total costs of the refunds.[80] Reuters quoted industry sources who estimated that the Tokyo Olympics Committee had taken out US$500–800 million in insurance, and that after accounting for costs such as rebooking sporting venues and the Olympic Village, little of that payout would be available to recoup the proceeds of lost and refunded ticket sales.[81] The local organizers are responsible for ticket sales and use them to defray the costs of holding the games; ticket sales were expected to bring in approximately US$800 million, but actual sales were close to zero.[82]\n\n\nIn June 2022, the Tokyo Organizing Committee revealed in the final budget report for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics that the cost for the Olympic Games was 640.4 billion yen (US$5.8 billion [f]), which was higher than the cost for the Rio 2016.[84][2]\n\n\n\n### Public opinion and COVID-19 effect during and after the Games[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the Tokyo Olympics being held, many Japanese people were negative about hosting the event, but their attitudes had become more positive towards the end of the Games. According to a public opinion poll conducted jointly by the Nippon News Network and the *Yomiuri Shimbun* newspaper, which targeted Japanese citizens at the end of the Olympics, 38% of respondents said that it was possible to hold the Olympics in a safe manner against COVID-19, while 55% said that it was not possible. However, 64% answered that it was good that the Tokyo Games had gone ahead, while 28% answered that they wished the event had not been held. Of the respondents, 61% were glad the event had been held without spectators and only 12% said that spectators should have been allowed.[85]\n\n\nOn 29 July, less than a week into the Games, journalist Masaki Kubota reported his analysis of the Japanese people's perspective on the Olympics, which he believed was greatly influenced by the change in the way the Japanese news media reported on the Games. He pointed out that many Japanese news media had insisted on canceling the Olympics, citing fears that COVID-19 would spread, but once Japanese athletes started winning medals, the media changed their reporting policy and began livening up the Olympics, which had the effect of altering public opinion in Japan.[86]\n\n\nOnce the Tokyo Olympics were underway, followed by the Tokyo Paralympics, there was a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Japan, especially those caused by the Delta variant. On 26 July, there were 60,157 cases detected in Japan, breaking the record of 44,961 cases recorded on 10 May. On 9 August, one day after the Olympics had ended, daily cases in Japan reached 100,000 for the first time, and new cases continued to increase until the peak on 23 August, when 156,931 cases were recorded.[87]\n\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\n![](image)The Olympic rings on display at Tokyo Bay to promote the Games\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee was originally headed by former Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori,[88] but he resigned in February 2021 due to backlash from sexist comments about women in meetings.[89][90][91] Seiko Hashimoto was chosen to succeed him. Tamayo Marukawa, Minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, was responsible for overseeing the preparations on behalf of the Japanese government.[91]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government set aside a fund of ¥400 billion (more than US$3.67 billion) to cover the cost of hosting the Games. The Japanese government was considering easing airspace restrictions to allow an increased slot capacity at both Haneda and Narita airports. A new railway line was planned to link both airports through an expansion of Tokyo Station, cutting travel time from Tokyo Station to Haneda from 30 minutes to 18 minutes, and from Tokyo Station to Narita from 55 minutes to 36 minutes; funded primarily by private investors, the line would cost ¥400 billion. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East) was also planning a new route near Tamachi to Haneda Airport.[92]\n\n\nThere were plans to fund the accelerated completion of the Central Circular Route, Tokyo Gaikan Expressway, and Ken-Ō Expressway, and the refurbishment of other major expressways in the area.[93] The Yurikamome automated transit line was also to be extended from its existing terminal at Toyosu Station to a new terminal at Kachidoki Station, passing the site of the Olympic Village, although the line was not expected to have adequate capacity to serve major events in the Odaiba area on its own.[94]\n\n\nIn April 2018, the Tokyo Organizing Committee signed a partnership with the International Labour Organization to ensure decent work in the preparation of and during the 2020 Olympic Games.[95]\n\n\nIn June 2020, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, Toshirō Mutō, stated that the committee was exploring options for streamlining the Games to achieve cost savings.[96] On 25 September, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee agreed to a suite of measures to simplify the Games' logistics, including a cut to non-athlete staff, use of online meetings, and streamlined transport, among others. The committee also outlined areas it would be exploring in order to maintain the health and safety of all participants.[97]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly built Japan National Stadium in Tokyo was the venue for the ceremonies and the athletics events.\nMain article: Venues of the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a ¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics.[98] In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\nIn June 2015, the government announced plans to reduce the new stadium's permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure.[100][101] The original plan to build a retractable roof was also abandoned.[102] At the end of 2015, as a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the new stadium (which had reached ¥252 billion), the government chose to reject Zaha Hadid's design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma's design had a budget of ¥149 billion. The changes meant the new stadium could not be completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended.[103] The National Stadium, which was inaugurated on 21 December 2019, was named the Olympic Stadium for the duration of the Tokyo Games.[104]\n\n\nIn October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the Olympic venues could exceed US$25 billion.[105]\n\n\nOf the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 were within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed.[106] On 16 October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns.[107] The plans were made official on 1 November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo.[108]\n\n\nIn general, as urban studies scholar Faure notes, \"The Tokyo 2020–2021 Games had a relatively moderate impact on the city, compared to previous cases such as Rio and Sochi, or cases in which a major Olympic park was built in Barcelona in 1992, and in Beijing in 2008. The transport infrastructure has been marginally improved by facilitating access for people with mobility constraints and improving signage in other languages. Haneda Airport has been expanded, and a hydrogen-powered bus rapid transit system has been introduced. Several sports and event facilities were built, including the new Olympic Stadium. Finally, the Olympic Village has been built on the Harumi landfill.\"[109]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Police patrolling and watching from a rooftop near the tennis venue\nIn December 2018, the Japanese government chose to ban drones from flying over venues being used for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. A similar ban was also imposed for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Japan also hosted.[110] In January 2020, counterterrorism drills began in different parts where the Games would take place, after intelligence data showed that terrorist groups could have carried out an attack seeking worldwide attention.[111] In July 2021, prior to the start of the Games, the Japan Coast Guard conducted counterterrorism drills in the Tokyo Bay. The drill consisted of two inflatable boats trying to stop a suspicious ship from getting to shore.[112]\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nApplications for volunteering at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were accepted beginning on 26 September 2018. By 18 January 2019, a total of 204,680 applications had been received by the Tokyo Organizing Committee.[113] Interviews to select the requisite number of volunteers began in February 2019, with training scheduled to take place in October 2019.[114] The volunteers at the venues were to be known as \"Field Cast\", and the volunteers in the city were to be known as \"City Cast\". These names were chosen from a shortlist of four from an original 150 pairs of names; the other three shortlisted names were \"Shining Blue\" and \"Shining Blue Tokyo\", \"Games Anchor\" and \"City Anchor\", and \"Games Force\" and \"City Force\". The names were chosen by the people who had applied to be volunteers at the Games.[115]\n\n\nAs of early June 2021, approximately 10,000 out of the 80,000 registered volunteers resigned from the Games. Media attributed the rise in pandemic cases as the reason for massive quitting.[116] More volunteer assignments were expected to be cancelled due to the spectator ban.[117]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Olympic medal\n\n![](image)Due to COVID-19 protocols, the medals were presented to the athletes on a tray and each athlete was asked to put on their own medal, rather than have it placed around their neck by a dignitary.[118]\nIn February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017.[119][120] A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year.[121]\n\n\nIn May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base.[122] The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019.[123]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2019 (one year ahead of the originally scheduled opening ceremony), the designs of the medals were unveiled.[124][125] The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition.[126] A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively.[125]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay was \"Hope Lights Our Way\".[127][128]\n\n\nAs determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games,[129] the 2020 Summer Olympics torch was scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent.[127] The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading \"Flame of Recovery\". After leaving Naraha on 26 March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals.[128]\n\n\nAfter the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021.[130] On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia.[131] On 20 August 2020, it was announced that the torch relay would begin again in Naraha, Fukushima on 25 March 2021, nearly a year later than originally planned.[130][132]\n\n\nThe final course of the relay was altered due to concerns regarding public health concerns about gatherings along the route (e.g., the Miyakojima leg was canceled), and the relay was held without spectators due to states of emergency in some regions (e.g., Matsuyama, Hiroshima, Hyōgo, and Okayama).[133] The relay ended at Tokyo's National Stadium (Olympic Stadium) on 23 July, with tennis player Naomi Osaka lighting the Olympic cauldron at the finale of the opening ceremony.[134] The cauldron lit in the Olympic Stadium was only used during the Opening and Closing ceremonies: a separate cauldron was lit on the Tokyo waterfront for public view at the Yume No Ohashi Bridge in Odaiba, making it only the second time in olympic history where the cauldron was not displayed in the athletics stadium, the other time being in 2016.[135]\n\n\n\n### Biosecurity protocols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Temperature check and COVID-19 countermeasures at the tennis venue\nIn February 2021, the IOC began releasing \"playbooks\" containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas around Greater Tokyo Area, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants would be asked to use Japan's COCOA Exposure Notification app and would be tested at least every four days. Athletes who tested positive would be unable to compete and could be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway would be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts would also need to test negative in order to be cleared for competition. Athletes would be discouraged from \"excessive\" celebrations because the actions could spread infected droplets.[136][137][138] The playbooks were criticized in a paper published by *The New England Journal of Medicine* in May 2021, for lacking \"scientifically rigorous risk assessment\" and failing to \"distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes\". The playbook stated that the athletes were required to arrive up to five days prior to the start of the competition and to leave within 48 hours of being eliminated from their sport or the conclusion of the competitions.[139][140]\n\n\nThe IOC recommended the vaccination of athletes against COVID-19 if vaccines were available to them, but this was not a prerequisite for participation and the IOC advised against athletes \"jumping the queue\" in order to obtain priority over essential populations.[141] On 12 March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they were approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and would purchase two doses for their nation's general public for each vaccinated athlete.[142] On 6 May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo.[143]\n\n\nApproximately 93,000 athletes and officials were exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving in Japan, provided that they remained in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccine doses allocated for this group, this led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the Games and when teams returned to their countries.[144][145]\n\n\nDue to international travel restrictions, the organizing committee announced in March 2021 that no international guests (including spectators, and friends and family members of the athletes) would be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators would be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting.[138] On 19 June 2021, Governor Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead.[146] On 21 June, it was announced that all venues would be capped at a maximum of 10,000 ticketed spectators or 50% capacity, whichever was lower.[147]\n\n\nOn 2 July 2021, the new TOCOG president Seiko Hashimoto warned that there was still a possibility of the Games being held behind closed doors because of rising COVID-19 cases in the country.[148][149] Japan's slow vaccination rate had been of particular concern.[150][151] A simulation run by the University of Tokyo in May 2021 projected that a new wave of infections could peak in mid-October if the Games went on after the existing state of emergency in Tokyo had expired.[152][153]\n\n\nOn 8 July 2021, after Tokyo had recorded 920 new COVID-19 cases (its highest increase since May), Prime Minister Suga declared a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area from 12 July through 22 August (ending only two days before the Paralympics' opening ceremony), and announced that all events at venues in the area would therefore be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. Hashimoto stated that \"it is extremely regrettable that the Games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections.\" IOC President Thomas Bach stated that \"we will support any measure which is necessary to have a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games for the Japanese people and all the participants.\"[150][151][154]\n\n\nThe announcement stated that spectators would still be allowed at events being held outside of Tokyo, subject to the approval by local health authorities and the aforementioned 50%/10,000-spectator limit. The prefectures of Fukushima, Hokkaido and Ibaraki announced that they would prohibit spectators at events held in the areas.[155] The opening ceremony was expected to be limited to fewer than 1,000 VIP guests, including IOC representatives and dignitaries,[156] while some events did allow members of other competing delegations to occupy spectator seats as well.[157] School students were invited to watch football matches in Ibaraki.[158][159]\n\n\nOn 16 July, it was reported that Bach had asked Prime Minister Suga about the possibility that restrictions on spectators could be eased later on if COVID-19 conditions were to improve in Tokyo.[156] However, on 2 August, Suga announced that all existing state of emergency declarations would be extended through 31 August, and be extended to Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and parts of Osaka.[160]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony tickets were expected to range from ¥12,000 to ¥300,000, with a maximum price of ¥130,000 for the finals of the athletics track and field events.[161] The average ticket price was ¥7,700, with half the tickets being sold for up to ¥8,000. A symbolic ticket price of ¥2,020 was expected for families, groups resident in Japan, and in conjunction with a school program.[161] Tickets would be sold through 40,000 shops in Japan and by mail order to Japanese addresses through the internet.[162] International guests, had they been allowed, would have needed to visit Japan during the sales period, or arrange to buy tickets through a third party such as a travel agent.[163]\n\n\nTickets went on general sale in Japan in the autumn of 2019 and were expected to be sold globally from June 2020; however, this plan was suspended when the Games were postponed on 24 March 2020. The Tokyo Organizing Committee confirmed that tickets already purchased would remain valid for the same sessions according to the new schedule and that refunds were also being offered.[164]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This included both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders would be refunded.[138] Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system.[138] It was ultimately announced in July that all local spectators were not allowed to attend any events held in Tokyo, Fukushima and Hokkaido.[150][151][154]\n\n\n\n### Cultural festival[edit]\n\n\nA cultural program known as Nippon Festival was scheduled to coincide with the Olympics and Paralympics, running from April to September 2021 as a series of streaming events held by the Tokyo Organizing Committee and other partners. The events reflected the themes of \"Participation and Interaction\", \"Towards the Realisation of an Inclusive Society\" and \"Reconstruction of the Tohoku Region\". The program was either downsized or reformatted to virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the postponement of the Games.[165] One of these events was a concert held on 18 July, which featured J-rock band Wanima, choreography by dancers Aio Yamada and Tuki Takamura, and the presentation of animated \"creatures\" based on illustrations \"embodying the thoughts and emotions of people from across the world\".[166]\n\n\nThe original plans for Nippon Festival included events such as *Kabuki x Opera* (a concert that would have featured stage actor Ichikawa Ebizō XI, opera singers Anna Pirozzi and Erwin Schrott, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra), an arts and culture festival focusing on disabilities,[167][168][169][170] and a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan shortly after the Olympics—which would have differed significantly from the traditional bi-monthly *Honbasho* tournaments, and featured special commentary in English and Japanese to help explain to spectators the customs and traditions of professional sumo, which are deeply rooted in the Shinto religion.[171][172]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A scene from the Opening Ceremony at the Olympic Stadium, with drones flying around and creating the official logo of the Games\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony was held on 23 July 2021 in the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. It included the traditional Parade of Nations. Emperor Naruhito formally opened the Games, and at the end of the torch relay the Olympic cauldron was lit by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka.[173]\n\n\nFor the first time in the 2020 Olympic Games, it was decided that one male and one female in each country would take turns holding flags and serve as two of them.[174] \nThis was done by embodying the \"Agenda 2020\" set during President Bach's term.[175][176]\n\n\nFor the first time in the history of the games, a moment of silence was observed in the opening ceremony for the victims of COVID-19, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and the Munich massacre.[177]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Olympic sports\n\n![](image)Nippon Budokan\n![](image)Ariake Arena\n![](image)Ariake Gymnastics Centre\n![](image)Tokyo Aquatics Centre\n![](image)Yoyogi Gymnasium\n![](image)Saitama Super Arena\n![](image)Ryogoku Kokugikan\n![](image)Enoshima Yacht Harbor, Kanagawa\n![](image)Tsurigasaki Beach, Chiba\nThe event program for the 2020 Summer Olympics was approved by the IOC executive board on 9 June 2017. IOC president Thomas Bach stated that their goal was to give the Games \"youthful\" and \"urban\" appeal, and to increase the number of female participants.[178][179]\n\n\nThe Games featured 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines. Karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding made their Olympic debut, while baseball and softball also made a one-off return to the Summer Olympics for the first time since 2008. 15 new events within existing sports were also added, including 3×3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and the return of madison cycling, as well as 9 new mixed events in several sports (table tennis, archery, judo, shooting (3), triathlon, 4 × 400 m relay running and 4 × 100 m medley swimming).[180]\n\n\nIn the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.[180]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2020 Summer Olympic Sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Artistic swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Marathon swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (35)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (5)\n* ![](image) Athletics (48)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* Baseball\n\t+ ![](image) Baseball (1)\n\t+ ![](image) Softball (1)\n* ![](image) Basketball\n\t+ Basketball (2)\n\t+ 3×3 basketball (2)\n | * ![](image) Boxing (13)\n* ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n* ![](image) Cycling\n\t+ BMX freestyle (2)\n\t+ BMX racing (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road cycling (4)\n\t+ Track cycling (12)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n* ![](image) Fencing (12)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n | * ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Golf (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (15)\n* ![](image) Karate\n\t+ Kata (2)\n\t+ Kumite (6)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Rugby sevens (2)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Skateboarding (4)\n* ![](image) Sport climbing (2)\n* ![](image) Surfing (2)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (3)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (14)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (12)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (6)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n#### New sports[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are \"relevant to sports fans of all generations\", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. The new entrant would join golf and rugby sevens (which would both debut in 2016) as part of the program of 28 \"core\" sports. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the executive board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic program. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each.[181][182][183]\n\n\nThe decision to drop wrestling surprised many media outlets, given that the sport's role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original program for the modern Games. *The New York Times* felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport.[184][185][186] Out of the shortlist from the IOC vote, Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.[184]\n\n\nOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling.[187] The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu.[188] At the 125th IOC Session on 8 September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.[189]\n\n\nWith the adoption of the *Olympic Agenda 2020* in December 2014, the IOC shifted from a \"sport-based\" approach to the Olympic program to an \"event-based\" program—establishing that organizing committees may propose discretionary events to be included in the program to improve local interest.[190][191] As a result of these changes, a shortlist of eight new proposed sports was unveiled on 22 June 2015, consisting of baseball/softball, bowling, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu.[192] On 28 September 2015, the Tokyo Organizing Committee submitted their shortlist of five proposed sports to the IOC: baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding.[193] These five new sports were approved on 3 August 2016 by the IOC during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and were included in the sports program for 2020 only, bringing the total number of sports at the 2020 Olympics to 33.[194][195]\n\n\n\n### Test events[edit]\n\n\nA total of 56 test events were scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games.[196][197]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner \"Ready, Steady, Tokyo\". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020.[198]\n\n\nAll test events originally scheduled to take place from 12 March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games.[g][199]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia has competed under the provisional name \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" in every Summer and Winter Games since its debut in 1996 because of the disputed status of its official name. The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the Prespa agreement, and the country was officially renamed North Macedonia in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games were North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name.[200]\n\n\nSince competing as Swaziland ten times at the Summer and Winter Olympics, Eswatini made its debut under that name after the renaming of the country by the king in 2018.[201]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it had provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they would be excluded from team sports. The head of WADA's Compliance Review Committee, Jonathan Taylor, stated that the IOC would not be able to use the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) designation as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes could not be portrayed as representing a specific country.[202][203][204] Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against WADA's decision.[205] After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 that the penalty placed on Russia be reduced. Instead of a total ban from all sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but the team would not be permitted to use the Russian name, flag, or anthem for a period of two years and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for \"Russia\" to be displayed on the team uniform—although it should be no more visible than the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation—as well as the use of the Russian flag's colors within the uniform's design.[206]\n\n\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.[207]\n\n\n\nOn 6 April 2021, North Korea announced that it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics because of COVID-19 concerns.[208] This marked North Korea's first absence from the Summer Olympics since 1988.[209] In September, a month after the games concluded, the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was banned from participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, after they failed to participate in the Tokyo Olympics. On 21 July 2021, Guinea announced it would not be sending a delegation to the Tokyo Olympics, allegedly due to COVID-19 concerns, though media outlets suggested that financial considerations may have been the real motivating factor.[210] Guinea later reversed the decision and confirmed that it would be participating.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Country by team size\nThe

of the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe 2020 schedule by session was approved by the IOC Executive Board on 18 July 2018, with the exception of swimming, diving, and artistic swimming. A more detailed schedule by event was released on 16 April 2019, still omitting a detailed schedule for the boxing events.[214][215] A detailed boxing schedule was released in late 2019.[216]\n\n\nThe original schedule was from 22 July to 9 August 2020. To postpone the Olympics until 2021, all events were delayed by 364 days (one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week), giving a new schedule of 21 July to 8 August 2021.[217]\n\n\n\n*All times and dates use Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● | Event

|\n\n\n### Medal ceremonies[edit]\n\n\nNaoki Satō composed the music for the medal ceremonies. Satō chose not to employ any musical elements distinctive to Japan \"because victory ceremonies are for athletes from around the world\" and he wanted all medalists to \"feel at ease\" when taking their places on the podium, regardless of their nationality.[221]\n\n\nThe bouquets presented to the athletes came from regions affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The individual flowers were selected to represent the prefectures of Miyagi, Fukushima, Iwate, and Tokyo. The sunflowers were grown in Miyagi, planted by families whose children had died during the disaster; the white and purple eustomas and Solomon's seals were provided by a non-profit initiative to boost the local economy in Fukushima; the small bright blue gentians were grown in Iwate; and aspidistras, grown in Tokyo, were chosen to complete the bouquets.[222]\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nPer the historical precedent of swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, swimming finals were held in the morning to allow live primetime broadcasts in the Americas. NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[223] with the company being one of the IOC's major sources of revenue.[224] Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country.[225][226]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n![](image)Miraitowa (left), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics, and Someity (right), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Paralympics\nThe official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design was meant to \"express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan\".[227] The checkered design resembles a pattern called *ichimatsu moyo* that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.[228] The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Théâtre de Liège in Belgium. The Games' bid slogan was *Discover Tomorrow* (Japanese: 未来（あした）をつかもう, romanized: *Ashita o tsukamō*). While *ashita* literally means \"tomorrow\", it is intentionally spelled as *mirai*, \"future\".[229] The official slogan *United by Emotion* was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan was used solely in English.[230]\n\n\nThe official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics was Miraitowa, a figure with blue-checkered *ichimatsu moyo* patterns inspired by the Games' official emblem. Its fictional characteristics include the ability to teleport.[231] Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision.[232][233] The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for \"future\" and \"eternity\",[231] and Someity is named after *someiyoshino*, a type of cherry blossom.[234] Someity's name also refers to the English phrase \"so mighty\".[235] The mascots were expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandizing and licensing deals.[236] For the legacy of the games on 3 January 2022, Ryo Taniguchi created Miraity (the future child of the mascots).[237]\n\n\n\n### Look of the Games[edit]\n\n\nAlongside the main *Emblem blue*, the five other colors used in the branding of the 2020 Games were : \n  *Kurenai red*,   *Ai blue*,   *Sakura pink*,   *Fuji purple*, and   *Matsuba green*. These five traditional colors of Japan were used as sub-colors to create points of difference in the color variations.[238]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal\n\nSeveral controversial issues occurred during the preparations for the Tokyo Games. There were allegations of bribery in the Japanese Olympic Committee's (JOC) bid and of plagiarism in the initial design for the Games' logo. On 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics over Istanbul or Madrid.[239][240] In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games.[241] The official emblems of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, designed by Kenjirō Sano [ja], were unveiled in July 2015 but were withdrawn and replaced following plagiarism accusations.[242][243] The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his logo design was copied, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs.[244]\n\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the \"Recovery Olympics\".[248][249]\n\n\nHowever, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are still disputed.[250] Some Tōhoku residents questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games slowed down recovery efforts, and that the region lost workers to projects associated with the Games.[251]\n\n\nIt was widely reported by international media that South Korea had asked the IOC to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics,[252] claiming it to be a symbol of Japan's imperialist past, recalling \"historic scars and pain\" for people of Korea just as the swastika \"reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II\".[253][254] Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is controversial because it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions, including the Attack on Pearl Harbor.[255] According to the Associated Press, the IOC issued a statement in response to South Korea's request, saying, \"sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case-by-case basis.\"[256] Russian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2021, the TOCOG president Yoshirō Mori resigned, after facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks.[258][259] The previous conduct of the new president, Seiko Hashimoto, has also drawn criticisms,[260] leading her to comment \"I regret it and think I should be careful\" on one of the accusations.[261] The head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies, Hiroshi Sasaki [ja], resigned in March 2021, after making demeaning comments about Naomi Watanabe.[262][263] Sasaki's replacement, Kentarō Kobayashi, was dismissed by the Organizing Committee the day before the opening ceremony,[264][265] after it was reported by Japanese media that he had made a joke about the Holocaust in a script for his comedy in 1998, saying \"Let's play Holocaust.\"[266] On the eve of the opening ceremony, Yoshihide Suga, the Prime Minister of Japan and the Supreme Advisor of the Organizing Committee,[267] described Kobayashi's jokes as \"outrageous and unacceptable\", but also said that the opening ceremony, which was directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned.[268]\n\n\nThe composer for the opening ceremony, Keigo Oyamada, resigned days before the ceremony after growing criticism of his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome.[269][270] On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, TOCOG announced their support of Oyamada as a composer and vowed not to change his selection for the ceremonies,[271][272] but growing criticism forced him to announce his resignation on 19 July.[273][274] The opening ceremony music included arrangements of video game soundtracks originating in Japan; however, this included music from the *Dragon Quest* series, composed by Koichi Sugiyama whom *The Daily Beast* described as \"notoriously homophobic and ultranationalist\", leading to further criticism of the Organizing Committee.[275]\n\n\nOfficials reported that by early June 2021, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit.[276] \"There's no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections,\" the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said,[277] also stating he did not believe this would impact the operation of the Games.[276] On 23 July, hundreds of anti-Olympic protestors gathered outside the Japan National Stadium before the opening ceremony. Security guards blocked reporters from leaving the stadium to interview protestors.[278] In total, more than 60,000 police were mobilized for security during the Games, and police were regularly deployed to break up public displays of protest, including tackling protestors on their way to join the anti-Olympic protest in Sendagaya during the closing ceremony on September 5, 2021. This overwhelming police presence, including plainclothes police officers who encircled the protest area, \"served as an effective tool to criminalize a peaceful rally and to maintain a frightening image of open protest.\"[279]\n\n\nWriting for *The Conversation*, Olympic scholar MacIntosh Ross raised concerns about the relationship between the IOC and WHO, suggesting the organizations showed a lack of concern for the health of Japanese citizens and Olympians. As Ross explained, \"when the IOC and WHO support a global mega-event held during a pandemic, it's difficult to believe that the well-being of the host nation remains a priority.\"[280] Similarly, Japan scholars O'Shea and Maslow remark, \"International media coverage and commentary runs the gamut from sometimes scathing critique for attempting to pull off a 'pandemic games', to praise and plaudits for successfully pulling off a 'pandemic games'. Still, the story that Japan—or at least the LDP—wanted to tell, of a newly reborn and 'normal' Japan (re-)entering the world stage remained untold. Instead, the story of the 2020/2021 Tokyo Olympics was more mundane, that of a state doing a decent job of managing Covid and hosting a mega-event against the wishes of many of its inhabitants.\"[281]\n\n\nA number of controversies arose during the Games, most notably the attempted repatriation on 1 August of Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, allegedly for her criticism of the national sports authorities and team management.[282] Refusing to return to Belarus, over fears for her safety,[283] Tsimanouskaya sought assistance from the IOC and traveled to Warsaw, Poland, on 4 August after being granted a humanitarian visa by Tokyo's Polish Embassy.[284]\n\n\nNear the end of the Olympics, it was reported that Australian athletes had damaged the village rooms before departure, leaving a pool of vomit on the floor, damaged beds and a hole in the wall. Australian rugby Olympians also reportedly became drunk on the flight to Sydney, leaving vomit in the plane bathroom and receiving complaints from other passengers. Team Australia chief Ian Chesterman played down the incidents, and said that the Olympians would not be punished.[285]\n\n\nAfter the Olympics concluded, New Zealand diving judge Lisa Wright revealed that during the diving events, Zhou Jihong, Vice President of FINA from China, allegedly launched a verbal tirade at Wright at the conclusion of the men's 10m platform final. Wright alleged that Zhou verbally abused her for underscoring Chinese divers.[286] Diving New Zealand subsequently complained about the incident to FINA's Ethics Panel. As a result, Zhou was ordered by in a FINA Ethics Panel decision[287] to write a letter of apology to Wright. A recommendation was also made by the Ethics Panel to disestablish Zhou's position as Diving Bureau Liaison for FINA. The FINA Ethics Panel stated that the incident during the men's platform final was \"unfortunate\" and led to a \"misunderstanding mixed with misjudgement\" between Wright and Zhou.[287] In May 2022, former international diver, Olympic judge and previous member of FINA's Technical Diving Committee from New Zealand Simon Latimer revealed he had sent a whistleblower complaint[288] to FINA's Executive Director Brent Nowicki in December 2021 detailing Zhou's alleged \"unethical behavior\" which also contained allegations that Zhou coached Chinese divers during major events during the 2020 Summer Olympics and she had manipulated judging panels in order to benefit Chinese athletes. Latimer claimed that Zhou's behavior was tarnishing the reputation of international diving and that she was acting in the interests of China rather than international diving as a whole. Subsequent to Latimer's complaint, video evidence emerged online showing Zhou coaching Chinese divers during competition sessions at the Olympics,[289] a behavior considered unethical given her supposedly neutral role as a FINA Vice President and Diving Bureau Liaison.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2020 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\nThe Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 reached a global broadcast audience of 3.05 billion people, according to independent research conducted on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Official coverage on Olympic broadcast partners' digital platforms alone generated 28 billion video views in total – representing a 139 per cent increase compared with the Olympic Games Rio 2016 and underlining the changing media landscape and Tokyo 2020's designation as the first streaming Games and the most watched Olympic Games ever on digital platforms.[290]\n\n\nSony and Panasonic partnered with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics.[291][292] In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games.[293] NHK broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies, and coverage of selected events in 8K.[294][295] Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games.[296][297]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics were broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38 billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.[298] The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserted that a \"right of abatement\" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to \"negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments\" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams.[224][299] According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.[300]\n\n\nIn Europe, this was the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics covered almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia.[301] Eurosport planned to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these were set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights.[302][303][304] In France, these were the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France Télévisions. Eurosport debuted as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure.[305]\n\n\nIn Canada, the 2020 Games were shown on CBC/Radio-Canada platforms, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN.[306][307][308] In Australia, they were aired by Seven Network.[309] In the Indian subcontinent, they were aired by Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN).[310]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2020 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Japan\n\t+ 1964 Summer Olympics – Tokyo\n\t+ 1972 Winter Olympics – Sapporo\n\t+ 1998 Winter Olympics – Nagano\n\t+ 2020 Summer Olympics – Tokyo\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The new emblem, created by Asao Tokolo, was introduced at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Made by checkboards, it expresses a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan. Previously, the original emblem, made by Kenjirō Sano, was scrapped after his design was found to be plagiarizing the logo of Théâtre de Liège, a Belgian theatre company.\n2. **^** Only an English motto was used during the Games.

Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.[6]\n\n\nOriginally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[7] However, the event retained the *Tokyo 2020* branding for marketing purposes.[8] It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators.[c] The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.[10]\n\n\nThe Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[d] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year[12] and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\n\n\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.[13]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals.[14][15][16] Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe three candidate cities were Tokyo, Istanbul, and Madrid. The applicant cities of Baku and Doha were not promoted to candidate status. A bid from Rome was withdrawn.[20]\n\n\n\n### Host city selection[edit]\n\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system.[20] None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 Summer Olympics host city election[21]\n| City\n | Team\n | Round 1\n | Runoff\n | Round 2\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | **42** | —\n | **60** |\n| Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey | 26\n | **49** | 36\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | 26\n | 45\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: COVID-19 cases at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics and List of athletes not attending the 2020 Summer Olympics due to COVID-19 concerns\n\nSee also: COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports\n\n![](image)Few pedestrians on the Shibuya Crossing during the state of emergency in the middle of Japan's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, early 2020\nIn January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Summer Olympic Games.[22] Tokyo organizers and the International Olympic Committee insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics.[23] The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \"made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest\".[24] Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event.[22] Also unlike the case for H1N1 \"swine flu\" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020.[25] In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[26] Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate.[27] In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed Games in their state, while John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19.[28][29]\n\n\nEstimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University predicted that states of emergency might be required during the Games.[30] The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts' panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the Games were to allow spectators.[31]\n\n\n\n### Qualifying event cancellation and postponement[edit]\n\n\nConcerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China.[32] The Asia & Oceania boxing qualification tournament, which was originally planned to be held from 3–14 February in Wuhan, China (the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March.[33] The third round of the women's football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia.[34] The European boxing qualification began on 14 March 2020 in London, United Kingdom, but was suspended after two days of competition before being rescheduled for April 2021.[35][36] It eventually resumed in June 2021 but was moved to Paris, France,[37] because of renewed concerns over travel to the United Kingdom. Other qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and mid-2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo.[38]\n\n\n\n### Effect on doping tests[edit]\n\n\nMandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that public health and safety were their topmost priorities.[39] The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3 February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the end of the month,[40] and the anti-doping organizations in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced their testing activities by the end of March.[39]\n\n\n\n### Postponement to 2021[edit]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) released a statement on 2 March 2020, confirming that preparations for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics were \"continuing as planned\".[41] On 23 March, both Canada and Australia indicated that they would withdraw from the Games if they were not postponed by a year.[42] On the same day, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated he would support a proposed postponement, citing that ensuring athlete safety was \"paramount,\" and veteran IOC member and former vice president Dick Pound said that he expected the Games to be postponed.[43][44]\n\n\nOn 24 March 2020, 122 days to go for the planned start, the IOC, TOCOG and prime minister Abe released a joint statement announcing that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be rescheduled to a date \"beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021\". They stated that the Games could \"stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times\", and that the Olympic flame could become \"the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present\".[45] Prime Minister Abe stated that IOC president Thomas Bach responded \"with 100% agreement\" to his proposal to delay the Games. For continuity and marketing purposes, it was agreed that the Games would still be branded as Tokyo 2020 despite the change in schedule.[8]\n\n\nOn 30 March 2020, the IOC and TOCOG announced that they had reached an agreement on the new dates for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which would now begin with the opening ceremony on 23 July 2021 and end with the closing ceremony on 8 August 2021, still to be held in Tokyo.[46][47] The subsequent Winter Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to begin on 4 February 2022, less than six months later. Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named \"Here We Go\" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots.[48]\n\n\n\n### Calls for cancellation[edit]\n\n\nHealth experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist.[49] In an interview, the then president of TOCOG and former Japanese prime minister, Yoshirō Mori, asserted that the Games would be \"scrapped\" if they could not go ahead in 2021.[50] On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games \"must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic\".[51] Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20 May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was \"a mammoth task\" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021.[52] However, both Mori and Bach expressed optimism about the Games going ahead.[50][52]\n\n\nA member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a *British Medical Journal* editorial, which stated, \"holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes—ignoring scientific and moral imperatives—is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security\".[53]\n\n\nOn 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had \"privately concluded\" that the Games would have to be cancelled.[54] The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were \"categorically untrue\".[55] The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19 February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled.[56] It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan.[57][58]\n\n\nPublic support for the Games in Japan decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.[59] Multiple organizations of medical professionals voiced oppositions to the Games,[53][60][61] while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement.[62] In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games.[63] The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association called for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo \"have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity\" in an open letter to the prime minister.[64] At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games.[65] Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement.[66]\n\n\nKenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected more than 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to \"prioritise life\" over the Olympics.[67] Japanese writers Jiro Akagawa[68][69] and Fuminori Nakamura also called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled.[70]\n\n\nOn 26 May 2021, the *Asahi Shimbun* newspaper, which was a local sponsor of the Games, published an editorial calling for Prime Minister Suga to \"calmly and objectively assess the situation and decide on the cancellation of the event this summer.\"[71] On 4 June it was reported that Japanese sponsors proposed to the organisers for \"the Games to be postponed for several months,\" citing a comment by a corporate sponsor senior executive: \"It just makes much, much more sense from our perspective to hold the Games when there are more vaccinated people, the weather is cooler and maybe public opposition is lower.\"[72]\n\n\nIn July 2021, it was announced that all events in Tokyo were to be held behind closed doors with no spectators due to a new state of emergency. A poll by the *Asahi Shimbun* found that 55% of those surveyed supported the cancellation of the Olympics, and 68% felt that organisers would not be able to suitably control COVID-19 at the Games.[73] The decision was also detrimental to local sponsors, which had planned in-person presences to promote their products during the Games; an executive of official sponsor Toyota stated that the company had pulled a television advertising campaign it had planned for the Games in Japan, citing that the Olympics were \"becoming an event that has not gained the public's understanding.\"[73][74]\n\n\nHad the games been cancelled, it would have been the first time since World War II that an Olympic event had been called off and the first games to be scrapped due to circumstances unrelated to war.[e] A complete cancellation would have also cost Japan ¥4.52 trillion (US$41.5 billion), based on operating expenses and loss of tourism activity due to Japan which had closed its international borders to foreign travellers since March 2020, did not eventually reopen until October 2022, and was initially scheduled to end preventive border measures in May 2023 but had moved early at the end of April of that year, less than two years after the Games ended.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Costs and insurance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an estimate conducted by professor emeritus Katsuhiro Miyamoto of Kansai University and reported by the NHK in March 2020, the cost of delaying the 2020 Olympics by one year would be 640.8 billion yen (US$5.8 billion), taking maintenance expenditures for the unused facilities into account.[75]\n\n\nThe Nomura Research Institute estimated that cancelling the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021 would cost around 1.81 trillion yen ($17 billion), less than the economic damages projected if another state of emergency is declared, noting that a decision to hold the games \"should be made based on the impact on infection risks, not from the standpoint of economic loss\".[77]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Games were protected through the commercial insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London, by global reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re. The IOC takes out around $800 million of insurance for each Summer Olympics, with the total amount of loss insured for the 2020 Games likely to be more than $2 billion.[*needs update*] The disruption caused by postponing the Games was covered by the insurance policy, with those likely to make claims for their financial losses including local organizers, sponsors, hospitality firms, and travel providers.[78][79][*needs update*]\n\n\nHolders of tickets purchased from overseas prior to postponement were entitled to refunds for both Olympic and Paralympic ticket purchases, except for the costs of cancelled hotel bookings. Although about 600,000 Olympic tickets and 300,000 Paralympic tickets were eligible to be refunded, organizers said that they would not release the total costs of the refunds.[80] Reuters quoted industry sources who estimated that the Tokyo Olympics Committee had taken out US$500–800 million in insurance, and that after accounting for costs such as rebooking sporting venues and the Olympic Village, little of that payout would be available to recoup the proceeds of lost and refunded ticket sales.[81] The local organizers are responsible for ticket sales and use them to defray the costs of holding the games; ticket sales were expected to bring in approximately US$800 million, but actual sales were close to zero.[82]\n\n\nIn June 2022, the Tokyo Organizing Committee revealed in the final budget report for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics that the cost for the Olympic Games was 640.4 billion yen (US$5.8 billion [f]), which was higher than the cost for the Rio 2016.[84][2]\n\n\n\n### Public opinion and COVID-19 effect during and after the Games[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the Tokyo Olympics being held, many Japanese people were negative about hosting the event, but their attitudes had become more positive towards the end of the Games. According to a public opinion poll conducted jointly by the Nippon News Network and the *Yomiuri Shimbun* newspaper, which targeted Japanese citizens at the end of the Olympics, 38% of respondents said that it was possible to hold the Olympics in a safe manner against COVID-19, while 55% said that it was not possible. However, 64% answered that it was good that the Tokyo Games had gone ahead, while 28% answered that they wished the event had not been held. Of the respondents, 61% were glad the event had been held without spectators and only 12% said that spectators should have been allowed.[85]\n\n\nOn 29 July, less than a week into the Games, journalist Masaki Kubota reported his analysis of the Japanese people's perspective on the Olympics, which he believed was greatly influenced by the change in the way the Japanese news media reported on the Games. He pointed out that many Japanese news media had insisted on canceling the Olympics, citing fears that COVID-19 would spread, but once Japanese athletes started winning medals, the media changed their reporting policy and began livening up the Olympics, which had the effect of altering public opinion in Japan.[86]\n\n\nOnce the Tokyo Olympics were underway, followed by the Tokyo Paralympics, there was a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Japan, especially those caused by the Delta variant. On 26 July, there were 60,157 cases detected in Japan, breaking the record of 44,961 cases recorded on 10 May. On 9 August, one day after the Olympics had ended, daily cases in Japan reached 100,000 for the first time, and new cases continued to increase until the peak on 23 August, when 156,931 cases were recorded.[87]\n\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\n![](image)The Olympic rings on display at Tokyo Bay to promote the Games\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee was originally headed by former Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori,[88] but he resigned in February 2021 due to backlash from sexist comments about women in meetings.[89][90][91] Seiko Hashimoto was chosen to succeed him. Tamayo Marukawa, Minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, was responsible for overseeing the preparations on behalf of the Japanese government.[91]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government set aside a fund of ¥400 billion (more than US$3.67 billion) to cover the cost of hosting the Games. The Japanese government was considering easing airspace restrictions to allow an increased slot capacity at both Haneda and Narita airports. A new railway line was planned to link both airports through an expansion of Tokyo Station, cutting travel time from Tokyo Station to Haneda from 30 minutes to 18 minutes, and from Tokyo Station to Narita from 55 minutes to 36 minutes; funded primarily by private investors, the line would cost ¥400 billion. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East) was also planning a new route near Tamachi to Haneda Airport.[92]\n\n\nThere were plans to fund the accelerated completion of the Central Circular Route, Tokyo Gaikan Expressway, and Ken-Ō Expressway, and the refurbishment of other major expressways in the area.[93] The Yurikamome automated transit line was also to be extended from its existing terminal at Toyosu Station to a new terminal at Kachidoki Station, passing the site of the Olympic Village, although the line was not expected to have adequate capacity to serve major events in the Odaiba area on its own.[94]\n\n\nIn April 2018, the Tokyo Organizing Committee signed a partnership with the International Labour Organization to ensure decent work in the preparation of and during the 2020 Olympic Games.[95]\n\n\nIn June 2020, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, Toshirō Mutō, stated that the committee was exploring options for streamlining the Games to achieve cost savings.[96] On 25 September, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee agreed to a suite of measures to simplify the Games' logistics, including a cut to non-athlete staff, use of online meetings, and streamlined transport, among others. The committee also outlined areas it would be exploring in order to maintain the health and safety of all participants.[97]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly built Japan National Stadium in Tokyo was the venue for the ceremonies and the athletics events.\nMain article: Venues of the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a ¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics.[98] In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\nIn June 2015, the government announced plans to reduce the new stadium's permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure.[100][101] The original plan to build a retractable roof was also abandoned.[102] At the end of 2015, as a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the new stadium (which had reached ¥252 billion), the government chose to reject Zaha Hadid's design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma's design had a budget of ¥149 billion. The changes meant the new stadium could not be completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended.[103] The National Stadium, which was inaugurated on 21 December 2019, was named the Olympic Stadium for the duration of the Tokyo Games.[104]\n\n\nIn October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the Olympic venues could exceed US$25 billion.[105]\n\n\nOf the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 were within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed.[106] On 16 October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns.[107] The plans were made official on 1 November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo.[108]\n\n\nIn general, as urban studies scholar Faure notes, \"The Tokyo 2020–2021 Games had a relatively moderate impact on the city, compared to previous cases such as Rio and Sochi, or cases in which a major Olympic park was built in Barcelona in 1992, and in Beijing in 2008. The transport infrastructure has been marginally improved by facilitating access for people with mobility constraints and improving signage in other languages. Haneda Airport has been expanded, and a hydrogen-powered bus rapid transit system has been introduced. Several sports and event facilities were built, including the new Olympic Stadium. Finally, the Olympic Village has been built on the Harumi landfill.\"[109]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Police patrolling and watching from a rooftop near the tennis venue\nIn December 2018, the Japanese government chose to ban drones from flying over venues being used for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. A similar ban was also imposed for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Japan also hosted.[110] In January 2020, counterterrorism drills began in different parts where the Games would take place, after intelligence data showed that terrorist groups could have carried out an attack seeking worldwide attention.[111] In July 2021, prior to the start of the Games, the Japan Coast Guard conducted counterterrorism drills in the Tokyo Bay. The drill consisted of two inflatable boats trying to stop a suspicious ship from getting to shore.[112]\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nApplications for volunteering at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were accepted beginning on 26 September 2018. By 18 January 2019, a total of 204,680 applications had been received by the Tokyo Organizing Committee.[113] Interviews to select the requisite number of volunteers began in February 2019, with training scheduled to take place in October 2019.[114] The volunteers at the venues were to be known as \"Field Cast\", and the volunteers in the city were to be known as \"City Cast\". These names were chosen from a shortlist of four from an original 150 pairs of names; the other three shortlisted names were \"Shining Blue\" and \"Shining Blue Tokyo\", \"Games Anchor\" and \"City Anchor\", and \"Games Force\" and \"City Force\". The names were chosen by the people who had applied to be volunteers at the Games.[115]\n\n\nAs of early June 2021, approximately 10,000 out of the 80,000 registered volunteers resigned from the Games. Media attributed the rise in pandemic cases as the reason for massive quitting.[116] More volunteer assignments were expected to be cancelled due to the spectator ban.[117]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Olympic medal\n\n![](image)Due to COVID-19 protocols, the medals were presented to the athletes on a tray and each athlete was asked to put on their own medal, rather than have it placed around their neck by a dignitary.[118]\nIn February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017.[119][120] A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year.[121]\n\n\nIn May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base.[122] The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019.[123]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2019 (one year ahead of the originally scheduled opening ceremony), the designs of the medals were unveiled.[124][125] The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition.[126] A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively.[125]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay was \"Hope Lights Our Way\".[127][128]\n\n\nAs determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games,[129] the 2020 Summer Olympics torch was scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent.[127] The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading \"Flame of Recovery\". After leaving Naraha on 26 March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals.[128]\n\n\nAfter the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021.[130] On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia.[131] On 20 August 2020, it was announced that the torch relay would begin again in Naraha, Fukushima on 25 March 2021, nearly a year later than originally planned.[130][132]\n\n\nThe final course of the relay was altered due to concerns regarding public health concerns about gatherings along the route (e.g., the Miyakojima leg was canceled), and the relay was held without spectators due to states of emergency in some regions (e.g., Matsuyama, Hiroshima, Hyōgo, and Okayama).[133] The relay ended at Tokyo's National Stadium (Olympic Stadium) on 23 July, with tennis player Naomi Osaka lighting the Olympic cauldron at the finale of the opening ceremony.[134] The cauldron lit in the Olympic Stadium was only used during the Opening and Closing ceremonies: a separate cauldron was lit on the Tokyo waterfront for public view at the Yume No Ohashi Bridge in Odaiba, making it only the second time in olympic history where the cauldron was not displayed in the athletics stadium, the other time being in 2016.[135]\n\n\n\n### Biosecurity protocols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Temperature check and COVID-19 countermeasures at the tennis venue\nIn February 2021, the IOC began releasing \"playbooks\" containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas around Greater Tokyo Area, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants would be asked to use Japan's COCOA Exposure Notification app and would be tested at least every four days. Athletes who tested positive would be unable to compete and could be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway would be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts would also need to test negative in order to be cleared for competition. Athletes would be discouraged from \"excessive\" celebrations because the actions could spread infected droplets.[136][137][138] The playbooks were criticized in a paper published by *The New England Journal of Medicine* in May 2021, for lacking \"scientifically rigorous risk assessment\" and failing to \"distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes\". The playbook stated that the athletes were required to arrive up to five days prior to the start of the competition and to leave within 48 hours of being eliminated from their sport or the conclusion of the competitions.[139][140]\n\n\nThe IOC recommended the vaccination of athletes against COVID-19 if vaccines were available to them, but this was not a prerequisite for participation and the IOC advised against athletes \"jumping the queue\" in order to obtain priority over essential populations.[141] On 12 March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they were approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and would purchase two doses for their nation's general public for each vaccinated athlete.[142] On 6 May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo.[143]\n\n\nApproximately 93,000 athletes and officials were exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving in Japan, provided that they remained in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccine doses allocated for this group, this led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the Games and when teams returned to their countries.[144][145]\n\n\nDue to international travel restrictions, the organizing committee announced in March 2021 that no international guests (including spectators, and friends and family members of the athletes) would be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators would be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting.[138] On 19 June 2021, Governor Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead.[146] On 21 June, it was announced that all venues would be capped at a maximum of 10,000 ticketed spectators or 50% capacity, whichever was lower.[147]\n\n\nOn 2 July 2021, the new TOCOG president Seiko Hashimoto warned that there was still a possibility of the Games being held behind closed doors because of rising COVID-19 cases in the country.[148][149] Japan's slow vaccination rate had been of particular concern.[150][151] A simulation run by the University of Tokyo in May 2021 projected that a new wave of infections could peak in mid-October if the Games went on after the existing state of emergency in Tokyo had expired.[152][153]\n\n\nOn 8 July 2021, after Tokyo had recorded 920 new COVID-19 cases (its highest increase since May), Prime Minister Suga declared a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area from 12 July through 22 August (ending only two days before the Paralympics' opening ceremony), and announced that all events at venues in the area would therefore be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. Hashimoto stated that \"it is extremely regrettable that the Games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections.\" IOC President Thomas Bach stated that \"we will support any measure which is necessary to have a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games for the Japanese people and all the participants.\"[150][151][154]\n\n\nThe announcement stated that spectators would still be allowed at events being held outside of Tokyo, subject to the approval by local health authorities and the aforementioned 50%/10,000-spectator limit. The prefectures of Fukushima, Hokkaido and Ibaraki announced that they would prohibit spectators at events held in the areas.[155] The opening ceremony was expected to be limited to fewer than 1,000 VIP guests, including IOC representatives and dignitaries,[156] while some events did allow members of other competing delegations to occupy spectator seats as well.[157] School students were invited to watch football matches in Ibaraki.[158][159]\n\n\nOn 16 July, it was reported that Bach had asked Prime Minister Suga about the possibility that restrictions on spectators could be eased later on if COVID-19 conditions were to improve in Tokyo.[156] However, on 2 August, Suga announced that all existing state of emergency declarations would be extended through 31 August, and be extended to Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and parts of Osaka.[160]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony tickets were expected to range from ¥12,000 to ¥300,000, with a maximum price of ¥130,000 for the finals of the athletics track and field events.[161] The average ticket price was ¥7,700, with half the tickets being sold for up to ¥8,000. A symbolic ticket price of ¥2,020 was expected for families, groups resident in Japan, and in conjunction with a school program.[161] Tickets would be sold through 40,000 shops in Japan and by mail order to Japanese addresses through the internet.[162] International guests, had they been allowed, would have needed to visit Japan during the sales period, or arrange to buy tickets through a third party such as a travel agent.[163]\n\n\nTickets went on general sale in Japan in the autumn of 2019 and were expected to be sold globally from June 2020; however, this plan was suspended when the Games were postponed on 24 March 2020. The Tokyo Organizing Committee confirmed that tickets already purchased would remain valid for the same sessions according to the new schedule and that refunds were also being offered.[164]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This included both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders would be refunded.[138] Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system.[138] It was ultimately announced in July that all local spectators were not allowed to attend any events held in Tokyo, Fukushima and Hokkaido.[150][151][154]\n\n\n\n### Cultural festival[edit]\n\n\nA cultural program known as Nippon Festival was scheduled to coincide with the Olympics and Paralympics, running from April to September 2021 as a series of streaming events held by the Tokyo Organizing Committee and other partners. The events reflected the themes of \"Participation and Interaction\", \"Towards the Realisation of an Inclusive Society\" and \"Reconstruction of the Tohoku Region\". The program was either downsized or reformatted to virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the postponement of the Games.[165] One of these events was a concert held on 18 July, which featured J-rock band Wanima, choreography by dancers Aio Yamada and Tuki Takamura, and the presentation of animated \"creatures\" based on illustrations \"embodying the thoughts and emotions of people from across the world\".[166]\n\n\nThe original plans for Nippon Festival included events such as *Kabuki x Opera* (a concert that would have featured stage actor Ichikawa Ebizō XI, opera singers Anna Pirozzi and Erwin Schrott, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra), an arts and culture festival focusing on disabilities,[167][168][169][170] and a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan shortly after the Olympics—which would have differed significantly from the traditional bi-monthly *Honbasho* tournaments, and featured special commentary in English and Japanese to help explain to spectators the customs and traditions of professional sumo, which are deeply rooted in the Shinto religion.[171][172]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A scene from the Opening Ceremony at the Olympic Stadium, with drones flying around and creating the official logo of the Games\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony was held on 23 July 2021 in the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. It included the traditional Parade of Nations. Emperor Naruhito formally opened the Games, and at the end of the torch relay the Olympic cauldron was lit by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka.[173]\n\n\nFor the first time in the 2020 Olympic Games, it was decided that one male and one female in each country would take turns holding flags and serve as two of them.[174] \nThis was done by embodying the \"Agenda 2020\" set during President Bach's term.[175][176]\n\n\nFor the first time in the history of the games, a moment of silence was observed in the opening ceremony for the victims of COVID-19, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and the Munich massacre.[177]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Olympic sports\n\n![](image)Nippon Budokan\n![](image)Ariake Arena\n![](image)Ariake Gymnastics Centre\n![](image)Tokyo Aquatics Centre\n![](image)Yoyogi Gymnasium\n![](image)Saitama Super Arena\n![](image)Ryogoku Kokugikan\n![](image)Enoshima Yacht Harbor, Kanagawa\n![](image)Tsurigasaki Beach, Chiba\nThe event program for the 2020 Summer Olympics was approved by the IOC executive board on 9 June 2017. IOC president Thomas Bach stated that their goal was to give the Games \"youthful\" and \"urban\" appeal, and to increase the number of female participants.[178][179]\n\n\nThe Games featured 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines. Karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding made their Olympic debut, while baseball and softball also made a one-off return to the Summer Olympics for the first time since 2008. 15 new events within existing sports were also added, including 3×3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and the return of madison cycling, as well as 9 new mixed events in several sports (table tennis, archery, judo, shooting (3), triathlon, 4 × 400 m relay running and 4 × 100 m medley swimming).[180]\n\n\nIn the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.[180]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2020 Summer Olympic Sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Artistic swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Marathon swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (35)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (5)\n* ![](image) Athletics (48)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* Baseball\n\t+ ![](image) Baseball (1)\n\t+ ![](image) Softball (1)\n* ![](image) Basketball\n\t+ Basketball (2)\n\t+ 3×3 basketball (2)\n | * ![](image) Boxing (13)\n* ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n* ![](image) Cycling\n\t+ BMX freestyle (2)\n\t+ BMX racing (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road cycling (4)\n\t+ Track cycling (12)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n* ![](image) Fencing (12)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n | * ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Golf (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (15)\n* ![](image) Karate\n\t+ Kata (2)\n\t+ Kumite (6)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Rugby sevens (2)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Skateboarding (4)\n* ![](image) Sport climbing (2)\n* ![](image) Surfing (2)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (3)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (14)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (12)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (6)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n#### New sports[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are \"relevant to sports fans of all generations\", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. The new entrant would join golf and rugby sevens (which would both debut in 2016) as part of the program of 28 \"core\" sports. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the executive board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic program. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each.[181][182][183]\n\n\nThe decision to drop wrestling surprised many media outlets, given that the sport's role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original program for the modern Games. *The New York Times* felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport.[184][185][186] Out of the shortlist from the IOC vote, Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.[184]\n\n\nOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling.[187] The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu.[188] At the 125th IOC Session on 8 September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.[189]\n\n\nWith the adoption of the *Olympic Agenda 2020* in December 2014, the IOC shifted from a \"sport-based\" approach to the Olympic program to an \"event-based\" program—establishing that organizing committees may propose discretionary events to be included in the program to improve local interest.[190][191] As a result of these changes, a shortlist of eight new proposed sports was unveiled on 22 June 2015, consisting of baseball/softball, bowling, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu.[192] On 28 September 2015, the Tokyo Organizing Committee submitted their shortlist of five proposed sports to the IOC: baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding.[193] These five new sports were approved on 3 August 2016 by the IOC during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and were included in the sports program for 2020 only, bringing the total number of sports at the 2020 Olympics to 33.[194][195]\n\n\n\n### Test events[edit]\n\n\nA total of 56 test events were scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games.[196][197]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner \"Ready, Steady, Tokyo\". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020.[198]\n\n\nAll test events originally scheduled to take place from 12 March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games.[g][199]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia has competed under the provisional name \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" in every Summer and Winter Games since its debut in 1996 because of the disputed status of its official name. The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the Prespa agreement, and the country was officially renamed North Macedonia in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games were North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name.[200]\n\n\nSince competing as Swaziland ten times at the Summer and Winter Olympics, Eswatini made its debut under that name after the renaming of the country by the king in 2018.[201]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it had provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they would be excluded from team sports. The head of WADA's Compliance Review Committee, Jonathan Taylor, stated that the IOC would not be able to use the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) designation as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes could not be portrayed as representing a specific country.[202][203][204] Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against WADA's decision.[205] After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 that the penalty placed on Russia be reduced. Instead of a total ban from all sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but the team would not be permitted to use the Russian name, flag, or anthem for a period of two years and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for \"Russia\" to be displayed on the team uniform—although it should be no more visible than the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation—as well as the use of the Russian flag's colors within the uniform's design.[206]\n\n\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.[207]\n\n\n\nOn 6 April 2021, North Korea announced that it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics because of COVID-19 concerns.[208] This marked North Korea's first absence from the Summer Olympics since 1988.[209] In September, a month after the games concluded, the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was banned from participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, after they failed to participate in the Tokyo Olympics. On 21 July 2021, Guinea announced it would not be sending a delegation to the Tokyo Olympics, allegedly due to COVID-19 concerns, though media outlets suggested that financial considerations may have been the real motivating factor.[210] Guinea later reversed the decision and confirmed that it would be participating.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Country by team size\nThe following 206 teams qualified (including the 104 universality places guaranteed in athletics, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).[212]\n\n\n\n\n\n|

of the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe 2020 schedule by session was approved by the IOC Executive Board on 18 July 2018, with the exception of swimming, diving, and artistic swimming. A more detailed schedule by event was released on 16 April 2019, still omitting a detailed schedule for the boxing events.[214][215] A detailed boxing schedule was released in late 2019.[216]\n\n\nThe original schedule was from 22 July to 9 August 2020. To postpone the Olympics until 2021, all events were delayed by 364 days (one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week), giving a new schedule of 21 July to 8 August 2021.[217]\n\n\n\n*All times and dates use Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● | Event

|\n\n\n### Medal ceremonies[edit]\n\n\nNaoki Satō composed the music for the medal ceremonies. Satō chose not to employ any musical elements distinctive to Japan \"because victory ceremonies are for athletes from around the world\" and he wanted all medalists to \"feel at ease\" when taking their places on the podium, regardless of their nationality.[221]\n\n\nThe bouquets presented to the athletes came from regions affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The individual flowers were selected to represent the prefectures of Miyagi, Fukushima, Iwate, and Tokyo. The sunflowers were grown in Miyagi, planted by families whose children had died during the disaster; the white and purple eustomas and Solomon's seals were provided by a non-profit initiative to boost the local economy in Fukushima; the small bright blue gentians were grown in Iwate; and aspidistras, grown in Tokyo, were chosen to complete the bouquets.[222]\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nPer the historical precedent of swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, swimming finals were held in the morning to allow live primetime broadcasts in the Americas. NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[223] with the company being one of the IOC's major sources of revenue.[224] Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country.[225][226]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n![](image)Miraitowa (left), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics, and Someity (right), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Paralympics\nThe official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design was meant to \"express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan\".[227] The checkered design resembles a pattern called *ichimatsu moyo* that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.[228] The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Théâtre de Liège in Belgium. The Games' bid slogan was *Discover Tomorrow* (Japanese: 未来（あした）をつかもう, romanized: *Ashita o tsukamō*). While *ashita* literally means \"tomorrow\", it is intentionally spelled as *mirai*, \"future\".[229] The official slogan *United by Emotion* was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan was used solely in English.[230]\n\n\nThe official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics was Miraitowa, a figure with blue-checkered *ichimatsu moyo* patterns inspired by the Games' official emblem. Its fictional characteristics include the ability to teleport.[231] Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision.[232][233] The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for \"future\" and \"eternity\",[231] and Someity is named after *someiyoshino*, a type of cherry blossom.[234] Someity's name also refers to the English phrase \"so mighty\".[235] The mascots were expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandizing and licensing deals.[236] For the legacy of the games on 3 January 2022, Ryo Taniguchi created Miraity (the future child of the mascots).[237]\n\n\n\n### Look of the Games[edit]\n\n\nAlongside the main *Emblem blue*, the five other colors used in the branding of the 2020 Games were : \n  *Kurenai red*,   *Ai blue*,   *Sakura pink*,   *Fuji purple*, and   *Matsuba green*. These five traditional colors of Japan were used as sub-colors to create points of difference in the color variations.[238]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal\n\nSeveral controversial issues occurred during the preparations for the Tokyo Games. There were allegations of bribery in the Japanese Olympic Committee's (JOC) bid and of plagiarism in the initial design for the Games' logo. On 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics over Istanbul or Madrid.[239][240] In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games.[241] The official emblems of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, designed by Kenjirō Sano [ja], were unveiled in July 2015 but were withdrawn and replaced following plagiarism accusations.[242][243] The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his logo design was copied, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs.[244]\n\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the \"Recovery Olympics\".[248][249]\n\n\nHowever, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are still disputed.[250] Some Tōhoku residents questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games slowed down recovery efforts, and that the region lost workers to projects associated with the Games.[251]\n\n\nIt was widely reported by international media that South Korea had asked the IOC to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics,[252] claiming it to be a symbol of Japan's imperialist past, recalling \"historic scars and pain\" for people of Korea just as the swastika \"reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II\".[253][254] Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is controversial because it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions, including the Attack on Pearl Harbor.[255] According to the Associated Press, the IOC issued a statement in response to South Korea's request, saying, \"sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case-by-case basis.\"[256] Russian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2021, the TOCOG president Yoshirō Mori resigned, after facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks.[258][259] The previous conduct of the new president, Seiko Hashimoto, has also drawn criticisms,[260] leading her to comment \"I regret it and think I should be careful\" on one of the accusations.[261] The head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies, Hiroshi Sasaki [ja], resigned in March 2021, after making demeaning comments about Naomi Watanabe.[262][263] Sasaki's replacement, Kentarō Kobayashi, was dismissed by the Organizing Committee the day before the opening ceremony,[264][265] after it was reported by Japanese media that he had made a joke about the Holocaust in a script for his comedy in 1998, saying \"Let's play Holocaust.\"[266] On the eve of the opening ceremony, Yoshihide Suga, the Prime Minister of Japan and the Supreme Advisor of the Organizing Committee,[267] described Kobayashi's jokes as \"outrageous and unacceptable\", but also said that the opening ceremony, which was directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned.[268]\n\n\nThe composer for the opening ceremony, Keigo Oyamada, resigned days before the ceremony after growing criticism of his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome.[269][270] On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, TOCOG announced their support of Oyamada as a composer and vowed not to change his selection for the ceremonies,[271][272] but growing criticism forced him to announce his resignation on 19 July.[273][274] The opening ceremony music included arrangements of video game soundtracks originating in Japan; however, this included music from the *Dragon Quest* series, composed by Koichi Sugiyama whom *The Daily Beast* described as \"notoriously homophobic and ultranationalist\", leading to further criticism of the Organizing Committee.[275]\n\n\nOfficials reported that by early June 2021, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit.[276] \"There's no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections,\" the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said,[277] also stating he did not believe this would impact the operation of the Games.[276] On 23 July, hundreds of anti-Olympic protestors gathered outside the Japan National Stadium before the opening ceremony. Security guards blocked reporters from leaving the stadium to interview protestors.[278] In total, more than 60,000 police were mobilized for security during the Games, and police were regularly deployed to break up public displays of protest, including tackling protestors on their way to join the anti-Olympic protest in Sendagaya during the closing ceremony on September 5, 2021. This overwhelming police presence, including plainclothes police officers who encircled the protest area, \"served as an effective tool to criminalize a peaceful rally and to maintain a frightening image of open protest.\"[279]\n\n\nWriting for *The Conversation*, Olympic scholar MacIntosh Ross raised concerns about the relationship between the IOC and WHO, suggesting the organizations showed a lack of concern for the health of Japanese citizens and Olympians. As Ross explained, \"when the IOC and WHO support a global mega-event held during a pandemic, it's difficult to believe that the well-being of the host nation remains a priority.\"[280] Similarly, Japan scholars O'Shea and Maslow remark, \"International media coverage and commentary runs the gamut from sometimes scathing critique for attempting to pull off a 'pandemic games', to praise and plaudits for successfully pulling off a 'pandemic games'. Still, the story that Japan—or at least the LDP—wanted to tell, of a newly reborn and 'normal' Japan (re-)entering the world stage remained untold. Instead, the story of the 2020/2021 Tokyo Olympics was more mundane, that of a state doing a decent job of managing Covid and hosting a mega-event against the wishes of many of its inhabitants.\"[281]\n\n\nA number of controversies arose during the Games, most notably the attempted repatriation on 1 August of Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, allegedly for her criticism of the national sports authorities and team management.[282] Refusing to return to Belarus, over fears for her safety,[283] Tsimanouskaya sought assistance from the IOC and traveled to Warsaw, Poland, on 4 August after being granted a humanitarian visa by Tokyo's Polish Embassy.[284]\n\n\nNear the end of the Olympics, it was reported that Australian athletes had damaged the village rooms before departure, leaving a pool of vomit on the floor, damaged beds and a hole in the wall. Australian rugby Olympians also reportedly became drunk on the flight to Sydney, leaving vomit in the plane bathroom and receiving complaints from other passengers. Team Australia chief Ian Chesterman played down the incidents, and said that the Olympians would not be punished.[285]\n\n\nAfter the Olympics concluded, New Zealand diving judge Lisa Wright revealed that during the diving events, Zhou Jihong, Vice President of FINA from China, allegedly launched a verbal tirade at Wright at the conclusion of the men's 10m platform final. Wright alleged that Zhou verbally abused her for underscoring Chinese divers.[286] Diving New Zealand subsequently complained about the incident to FINA's Ethics Panel. As a result, Zhou was ordered by in a FINA Ethics Panel decision[287] to write a letter of apology to Wright. A recommendation was also made by the Ethics Panel to disestablish Zhou's position as Diving Bureau Liaison for FINA. The FINA Ethics Panel stated that the incident during the men's platform final was \"unfortunate\" and led to a \"misunderstanding mixed with misjudgement\" between Wright and Zhou.[287] In May 2022, former international diver, Olympic judge and previous member of FINA's Technical Diving Committee from New Zealand Simon Latimer revealed he had sent a whistleblower complaint[288] to FINA's Executive Director Brent Nowicki in December 2021 detailing Zhou's alleged \"unethical behavior\" which also contained allegations that Zhou coached Chinese divers during major events during the 2020 Summer Olympics and she had manipulated judging panels in order to benefit Chinese athletes. Latimer claimed that Zhou's behavior was tarnishing the reputation of international diving and that she was acting in the interests of China rather than international diving as a whole. Subsequent to Latimer's complaint, video evidence emerged online showing Zhou coaching Chinese divers during competition sessions at the Olympics,[289] a behavior considered unethical given her supposedly neutral role as a FINA Vice President and Diving Bureau Liaison.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2020 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\nThe Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 reached a global broadcast audience of 3.05 billion people, according to independent research conducted on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Official coverage on Olympic broadcast partners' digital platforms alone generated 28 billion video views in total – representing a 139 per cent increase compared with the Olympic Games Rio 2016 and underlining the changing media landscape and Tokyo 2020's designation as the first streaming Games and the most watched Olympic Games ever on digital platforms.[290]\n\n\nSony and Panasonic partnered with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics.[291][292] In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games.[293] NHK broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies, and coverage of selected events in 8K.[294][295] Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games.[296][297]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics were broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38 billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.[298] The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserted that a \"right of abatement\" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to \"negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments\" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams.[224][299] According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.[300]\n\n\nIn Europe, this was the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics covered almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia.[301] Eurosport planned to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these were set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights.[302][303][304] In France, these were the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France Télévisions. Eurosport debuted as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure.[305]\n\n\nIn Canada, the 2020 Games were shown on CBC/Radio-Canada platforms, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN.[306][307][308] In Australia, they were aired by Seven Network.[309] In the Indian subcontinent, they were aired by Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN).[310]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2020 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Japan\n\t+ 1964 Summer Olympics – Tokyo\n\t+ 1972 Winter Olympics – Sapporo\n\t+ 1998 Winter Olympics – Nagano\n\t+ 2020 Summer Olympics – Tokyo\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The new emblem, created by Asao Tokolo, was introduced at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

This marked the second time that South Korea had hosted the Olympic Games (having previously hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul), as well as the first time it hosted the Winter Olympics. The 2018 Games marked the third time that an Asian country had hosted the Winter Olympics, after Sapporo 1972 and Nagano 1998, both in Japan. It was also the first Winter Olympics held in mainland Asia, and the first of three consecutive Olympic Games held in East Asia, preceding the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan and the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics in China.\n\n\nThe 2018 Games featured 102 events over 15 disciplines, a record number of events for the Winter Games. This is the first edition in Winter Olympic Games history to feature more than 100 medal events, four of which made their Olympic debut in 2018: \"big air\" snowboarding, mass start speed skating, mixed doubles curling, and mixed team alpine skiing. A total of 2,914 athletes from 93[note 1] teams competed, with the national debuts of Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.\n\n\nAfter a state-sponsored doping program was exposed following the 2014 Winter Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee was suspended, but selected athletes were allowed to compete neutrally under the special IOC designation of \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR), provided they could meet certain anti-doping requirements. North Korea agreed to participate in the Games in spite of tense relations with South Korea. The two nations paraded together at the opening ceremony as a unified Korea, and fielded a unified team (COR) in the women's ice hockey.\n\n\nSouth Korea ranked seventh overall at the 2018 Winter Games, with five gold medals and 17 overall medals. South Korea has traditionally been a country that won many medals in short track speed skating, but in this competition, it also won medals in skeleton racing, curling and skiing. South Korea's Yun Sung-Bin won a gold medal in men's skeleton racing, the first Olympic gold ever won by Asia in the sledding event. Norway led the total medal tally with 39, followed by Germany at 31 and Canada at 29.[1] Germany and Norway were tied for the highest number of gold medals, both winning 14.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding and election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Pyeongchang's award card, announced by the IOC's honorary president Jacques Rogge\n![](image)Woljeongsa in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do\n![](image)Sangwonsa in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do\nPyeongchang was elected as the host city at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa, on 6 July 2011, earning the necessary majority of at least 48 votes in just one round of voting.[2] Winning 63 of the 95 votes cast in the first secret ballot, Pyeongchang received more votes than its competitors combined, overwhelmingly beating Munich in Germany, which received 25 votes, and Annecy in France, which received seven.[3][4]\n\n\nThis was South Korea's third consecutive bid for the Winter Olympics, having been defeated by Vancouver and Sochi respectively in the final rounds of voting for the 2010 and 2014 Games.[3] Earlier, PyeongChang lost to Vancouver with a difference of 3 votes in bidding the 2010 Olympics, and lost to Sochi with a difference of 4 votes in bidding the 2014 Olympics. Since then, South Korea made great progress in preparing to host the Winter Olympics and succeeded in hosting the 2018 Olympics after three challenges.[4]\n\n\nAfter winning the election, Pyeongchang became the third Asian city to host the Winter Olympics.[2][3] Also, South Korea became the second country in Asia to host both the Summer (1988 Seoul Olympics) and Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Winter Olympics bidding results[5]\n| City\n | Nation\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Pyeongchang** | **![](image) South Korea** | **63** |\n| Munich | ![](image) Germany | 25\n |\n| Annecy | ![](image) France | 7\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\n![Pyeongchang is located in South Korea](image)![Pyeongchang](image)\nPyeongchang\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Pyeongchang in South Korea\n\nOn 5 August 2011, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the formation of the Pyeongchang 2018 Coordination Commission.[6][7] On 4 October 2011, it was announced that the Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympics would be headed by Kim Jin-sun. The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues.[8] The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village.[9][10] In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul.[11]\n\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee met for an orientation with the Pyeongchang 2018 organizing committee in July 2012.[12] Then-IOC President Jacques Rogge visited Pyeongchang for the first time in February 2013.[13]\n\n\nThe Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games created Pyeongchang WINNERS in 2014 by recruiting university students living in South Korea to spread awareness of the Olympic Games through social networking services and news articles.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)2018 Olympics gold medal\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nThe design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 21 September 2017. Created by Lee Suk-woo, the design features a pattern of diagonal ridges on both sides, with the Olympic rings on the front, and the obverse showing the 2018 Olympics' emblem, the event name and the discipline. The edge of each medal is marked with extrusions of hangul alphabets, while the ribbons are made from a traditional South Korean textile.[15] Gold medals contained 99 percent of silver and 1 percent of gold, which is a traditional composition for Olympic gold medals. At 586 grams (20.7 oz) they were the heaviest medals in the Olympic history.[16][17]\n\n\n\n![](image)2018 Winter Olympics torch\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics torch relay\n\nThe torch relay started on 24 October 2017 in Greece and lasted for 101 days, ending at the start of the Olympics on 9 February 2018. The Olympic torch entered South Korea on 1 November 2017. There were 7,500 torch bearers to represent the combined Korean population of approximately 75 million people. There were also 2,018 support runners to guard the torch and act as messengers.\n\n\nThe torch and its bearers traveled by a diverse means of transportation, including by turtle ship in Hansando Island, sailboat on the Baengmagang River in Buyeo, marine cable car in Yeosu, zip-wire over Bamseom Island, steam train in the Gokseong Train Village, marine rail bike along the east coast in Samcheok, and by yacht in Busan Metropolitan City.\n\n\nThere were also robot torch relays in Jeju and Daejeon.[18]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic venues 2018\nMain article: Venues of the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Dragon Valley (Alpensia) Ski Resort\n![](image)Alpensia Resort and wind turbines in Pyeongchang\nMost of the outdoor snow events were held in the county of Pyeongchang, while some of the alpine skiing events took place in the neighboring county of Jeongseon. The indoor ice events were held in the nearby city of Gangneung.\n\n\n\n#### Pyeongchang (mountain cluster)[edit]\n\n\nThe Alpensia Sports Park in Daegwallyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang, was the focus of the 2018 Winter Olympics.[19][20] It was home to the Olympic Stadium,[21] the Olympic Village and most of the outdoor sports venues.\n\n\n\n* Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre – ski jumping, Nordic combined, snowboarding (big air)\n* Alpensia Biathlon Centre – biathlon\n* Alpensia Cross-Country Skiing Centre – cross-country skiing, Nordic combined\n* Alpensia Sliding Centre – luge, bobsleigh, skeleton\n* Yongpyong Alpine Centre – alpine skiing (slalom, giant slalom)\n\n\nAdditionally, a stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in Bongpyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang:\n\n\n\n* Phoenix Snow Park – freestyle skiing, snowboarding\n\n\nAnother stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in neighboring Jeongseon county:\n\n\n\n* Jeongseon Alpine Centre – alpine skiing (downhill, super-G, combined)\n\n\n#### Gangneung (coastal cluster)[edit]\n\n\nThe Gangneung Olympic Park, in the neighborhood of Gyo-dong in Gangneung city, includes four indoor sports venues, all in close proximity to one another.\n\n\n\n* Gangneung Hockey Centre – ice hockey (men's competition)\n* Gangneung Curling Centre – curling\n* Gangneung Oval[21] – long track speed skating\n* Gangneung Ice Arena – short track speed skating, figure skating\n\n\nIn addition, a stand-alone indoor sports venue was located in the grounds of Catholic Kwandong University.\n\n\n\n* Kwandong Hockey Centre – ice hockey (women's competition)\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nTicket prices for the 2018 Winter Olympics were announced in April 2016 and tickets went on sale in October 2016. Event tickets ranged in price from ₩20,000 South Korean won (approx. US$17) to ₩900,000 (~US$787) while tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies ranged from ₩220,000 (~US$192) to ₩1.5 million (~US$1311). The exact prices were determined through market research; around 50% of the tickets were expected to cost about ₩80,000 (~US$70) or less, and tickets in sports that are relatively unknown in the region, such as biathlon and luge, were made cheaper in order to encourage attendance. By contrast, figure skating and the men's ice hockey gold-medal game carried the most expensive tickets of the Games.[22]\n\n\nAs of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold.[23][24] However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold.[25]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Parade of Nations at 2018 Olympic opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018. The US$100 million facility was only intended to be used for the opening and closing ceremonies of these Olympics and the subsequent Paralympics; it was demolished following their conclusion.[26][27][28]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics featured 102 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports,[29] making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Six new events in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic program in Pyeongchang: men's and ladies' big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling, men's and ladies' mass start speed skating, and mixed team alpine skiing.[29][30]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Winter Olympic sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n* Bobsledding\n\t+ ![](image) Bobsleigh (3) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n* ![](image) Curling (3) (details)\n* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n | * ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n* Skating\n\t+ ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Short track speed skating (8) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Speed skating (14) (details)\n | * Skiing\n\t+ ![](image) Alpine skiing (11) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Freestyle skiing (10) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Ski jumping (4) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Snowboarding (10) (details)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.*\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record total of 93[note 1] teams qualified at least one athlete to compete in the Games. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Six nations made their Winter Olympics debuts: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.[31] Athletes from three further countries – the Cayman Islands, Dominica, and Peru – qualified to compete, but all three National Olympic Committees returned the quota spots back to the International Ski Federation (FIS).[32]\n\n\nUnder a historic agreement facilitated by the IOC, qualified athletes from North Korea were allowed to cross the Korean Demilitarized Zone into South Korea to compete in the Games.[33][34][35] The two nations marched together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][37] A unified Korean team, consisting of 12 players from North Korea and 23 from South Korea, competed in the women's ice hockey tournament under a special IOC country code designation (COR) following talks in Panmunjom on 17 January 2018.[36] The two nations also participated separately: the South Korea team competed in every sport, while the North Korea team competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and short track speed skating.[38]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended due to the Russian doping scandal and the investigation into the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Individual Russian athletes, who qualified and could demonstrate they had complied with the IOC's doping regulations, were given the option to compete at the 2018 Games as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) under the Olympic flag and with the Olympic anthem played at any ceremony.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the

Korea and South Korea formed a unified Korean women's ice hockey team.  \n\nb Russian athletes were entitled to participate as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) if individually cleared by the IOC.\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nThe IOC has allowed NBC to influence the Olympic event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible, due to the substantial fees paid by NBC for rights to the Olympics (which have been extended through 2032 with a nearly $8 billion agreement), the company being one of IOC's major sources of revenue.[46][47] As figure skating is one of the most popular Winter Olympic sports among U.S. viewers, the figure skating events were scheduled with morning start times to accommodate primetime broadcasts in the Americas. This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions.[48]\n\n\nConversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.[49]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n*All dates are KST (UTC+9)*\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

Records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n* Noriaki Kasai of Japan became the first athlete in history to participate in eight Winter Olympics when he took part in the ski jumping qualification the day before the opening of the Games.[54] The previous record of seven Winter Olympics was held by Russian luger Albert Demchenko.\n* Japanese athlete Yuzuru Hanyu became the fourth male figure skater (after Gillis Grafström, Karl Schäfer, and Dick Button) to win two consecutive Olympic gold medals.\n* American Nathan Chen became the first figure skater to land five quadruple jumps in one program.[55]\n* German figure skaters Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot set a new ISU best free skating score of 159.31 in pair skating.[56]\n* Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir became the most decorated figure skaters in Olympic history with a total of 5 medals.\n* Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir set a new ISU best short dance score of 83.67[57] and a new ISU best combined total score of 206.07[58] in ice dance. French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron set a new ISU best free dance score of 123.35.[59]\n* Russian figure skater Alina Zagitova set a new ISU best short program score of 82.92 in Ladies' single skating.[60]\n* Dutch speed skater Sven Kramer won gold in the men's 5000 m event, becoming the only male speed skater to win the same Olympic event three times. He was also the first man to win a total of eight Olympic medals in speed skating.[61]\n* Dutch speed skater Ireen Wüst won an individual gold medal for the fourth Olympics in a row, the first time this had been achieved by a Winter Olympian. She also became the first speed skater (male or female) to win ten Winter Olympic medals and the first female Winter Olympian to win nine individual medals.[62]\n* Chinese short track speed skater Wu Dajing beat the men's 500 m world record twice en route to winning a gold medal, becoming only the second person in history to skate the discipline in under 40 seconds (after American J. R. Celski), and the first to achieve this at \"sea level\".[63]\n* Dutch athlete Jorien ter Mors became the first female athlete to win Olympic medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games;[64] she won a speed skating gold medal in the 1000 m and she was also part of the Dutch short track team that won bronze in the 3000 m relay.\n* Ester Ledecká of the Czech Republic won gold in the super-G skiing event and another gold in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom, making her the first female athlete to win Olympic gold medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games.[65]\n* Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen won bronze in the women's team sprint and gold in the 30 km classical event, bringing her total Olympic medal haul to fifteen, the most won by any athlete (male or female) in Winter Olympics history.[66] The record was previously held by fellow Norwegian athlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen who has thirteen Olympic medals.\n* Germany and Canada tied for gold in the two-man bobsleigh event, only the second time in history that two countries had tied for a gold medal in this particular event, the first time being in the 1998 Winter Olympics twenty years earlier.[67]\n* Norway won a total of 39 medals, setting a new record for the highest number of medals won at a single Winter Olympics. Their 39th medal was the last gold medal won by cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen in the 30 km classical event. The record was previously held by the USA who won 37 medals in Vancouver 2010.[68]\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 25 February 2018. IOC president Thomas Bach declared the Games closed, and the cauldron was extinguished. The Olympic flag was handed to Beijing, the next host city of the Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of 2018 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nBroadcast rights to the 2018 Winter Olympics were already sold in some countries as part of long-term broadcast rights deals, including the Games' local rightsholder SBS, which in July 2011 had extended its rights to the Olympics through 2024.[69] SBS sub-licensed its rights to MBC and KBS.[70]\n\n\nOn 29 June 2015, the IOC announced that Discovery Communications (now Discovery, Inc.) had acquired exclusive rights to the Olympics across all of Europe (excluding Russia) from 2018 through 2024. Discovery's pan-European Eurosport channels were promoted as the main broadcaster of the Games, but Discovery's free-to-air channels such as DMAX in Spain,[71] Kanal 5 in Sweden, and TVNorge in Norway, were also involved in the overall broadcasting arrangements.[72] Discovery was required to sub-license at least 100 hours of coverage to free-to-air broadcasters in each market;[73][74] some of these agreements required certain sports to be exclusive to Eurosport and its affiliated networks.[75] The deal did not initially cover France due to the broadcast rights of France Télévisions, which run through to the 2020 Games.[76] In the United Kingdom, Discovery held exclusive pay television rights under licence from the BBC, in return for the BBC sub-licensing the free-to-air rights to the 2022 and 2024 Olympics from Discovery.[77]\n\n\nRussian state broadcaster Channel One, and sports channel Match TV, committed to covering the Games with a focus on Russian athletes.[76] Russia was not affected by the Eurosport deal, due to a pre-existing contract held by a marketing agency which extends to 2024.[76]\n\n\nIn the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under a long-term contract (this would be the only time that the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics will be held on NBC on the same year).[78][79] On 28 March 2017, NBC announced that it would adopt a new format for its primetime coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, with a focus on live coverage in all time zones to take advantage of Pyeongchang's 14-hour difference with U.S. Eastern Time (and 17-hour difference with U.S. Pacific Time), and to address criticism of its previous tape delay practices. As before, the primetime block began at 8:00 p.m. ET (5:00 p.m. PT), and unlike previous Olympics, was available for streaming. Figure skating events were deliberately scheduled with morning sessions so they could be aired during primetime in the Americas (and in turn, NBC's coverage; due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible; NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on 7 May 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[46] is also one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC).[47][48] Coverage took a break in the East for late local news, after which coverage continued into \"Primetime Plus\", featuring additional live coverage into the Eastern late night and Western primetime hours.\n\n\nNHK and Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) once again filmed portions of the Games in high-dynamic-range 8K resolution video, including 90 hours of footage of selected events and the opening ceremonies.[80][81] ATSC 3.0 digital terrestrial television, using 4K resolution, was introduced in South Korea in 2017 in time for the Olympics.[82][83] This footage was delivered in 4K in the U.S. by NBCUniversal parent Comcast to participating television providers, including its own Xfinity, as well as DirecTV and Dish Network. NBC's Raleigh-based affiliate WRAL-TV also held demonstration viewings as part of its ATSC 3.0 test broadcasts.[84][85][86]\n\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics were used to showcase 5G wireless technologies, as part of a collaboration between domestic wireless sponsor KT, and worldwide sponsor Intel. Several venues were outfitted with 5G networks to facilitate features such as live camera feeds from bobsleds, and multi-camera views from cross-country and figure skating events. These were offered as part of public demonstrations coordinated by the two sponsors.[87][88]\n\n\nThe winners of the Olympic Golden Rings Awards were announced in June 2019. There were 75 pieces of broadcast content from the 2018 Olympics submitted over ten categories (plus one category for the 2018 Youth Olympics). NBC won a total of eight awards, winning four of the main categories: Best Olympic Feature, Best Olympic Digital Service, Best Olympic program and Best Documentary Film; they came second in the Best On-Air Promotion and Best Social Media Content/Production categories. Discovery/Eurosport won four categories: Best On-Air Promotion, Best Production Design, Best Innovation and Best Social Media Content/Production; they also came second in the Best Olympic Digital Service category. The BBC and NHK took the other two main awards: Most Sustainable Operation and Best Athlete Profile respectively. The title of Best Feature at the Youth Olympic Games Buenos Aires 2018 was also awarded to the BBC.[89]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics marketing\n\nThe official emblem, reflecting ice crystals and derived from the hangul letters ㅍ and ㅊ—the initial sounds of \"Pyeong\" and \"Chang\"—was unveiled on 3 May 2013.[90] In all official materials, the name of the host city was stylized in CamelCase as \"PyeongChang\", in order to alleviate potential confusion with Pyongyang, the similarly named capital of neighboring North Korea.[91]\n\n\nNew international sponsorship deals also debuted in Pyeongchang: Toyota was introduced as the new \"Mobility\" sponsor of the Olympics, although the company waived its domestic sponsorship to the local competitors Hyundai and Kia due to their support of the Pyeongchang bid.[92][93][94][95][96] Alibaba Group and Intel also debuted as e-commerce/cloud services and technology sponsors respectively.[97][98]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n### North–South Korean relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: North Korea–South Korea relations, 2017–18 North Korea crisis, and North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nDue to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests. On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games.[99] The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic, the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Protesters at Gwanghwamun Plaza, criticizing the event's pro-North Korean measures\nThe next day, Austria and Germany raised similar concerns and also threatened to skip the Games. France later reaffirmed its participation.[101] In early December 2017, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told Fox News that it was an \"open question\" whether the United States was going to participate in the Games, citing security concerns in the region.[102] However, days later the White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, stated that the United States would participate.[103]\n\n\nIn his New Year's address on 1 January 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un proposed talks in Seoul over the country's participation in the Games, which would be the first high-level talks between the North and South in over two years. Because of the talks, held on 9 January, North Korea agreed to field athletes in Pyeongchang.[104][105] On 17 January 2018, it was announced that North and South Korea had agreed to field a unified Korean women's ice hockey team at the Games, and to enter together under a Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][106]\n\n\nThese moves were met with opposition in South Korea, including protests and online petitions; critics argued that the government was attempting to use the Olympics to spread pro-North Korean sentiment, and that the unified ice hockey team would fail.[107] A rap video entitled \"The Regret for Pyeongchang\" (평창유감), which echoed this criticism and called the event the \"Pyongyang Olympics\", went viral in the country.[108] Japan's foreign affairs minister Tarō Kōno warned South Korea to be wary of North Korea's \"charm offensive\", and not to ease its pressure on the country.[36][109]\n\n\nThe South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, at the start of the Olympics shook hands with Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and a prominent figure of the regime. This marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea.[110][111] In contrast, U.S. vice president Mike Pence met with Fred Warmbier (father of Otto Warmbier, who had died after being released from captivity in North Korea) and a group of North Korean defectors in Pyeongchang.[112] American officials said that North Korea cancelled a meeting with Pence at the last minute.[113]\n\n\nAt the closing ceremony, North Korea sent general Kim Yong-chol as its delegate. His presence was met with hostility from South Korean conservatives, as there were allegations that he had a role in the ROKS *Cheonan* sinking and other past attacks. The Ministry of Unification stated that \"there is a limitation in pinpointing who was responsible for the incident.\" Although he is subject to sanctions, they did not affect his ability to visit the country for the Games.[114][115]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, Oswald Commission, Russian doping scandal after the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russian doping scandal at the 2016 Summer Olympics, and Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nRussia's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics was affected by the aftermath of its state-sponsored doping program. As a result, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in December 2017, although Russian athletes whitelisted by the IOC were allowed to compete neutrally under the OAR (Olympic Athletes from Russia) designation.[116] The official sanctions imposed by the IOC included: the exclusion of Russian government officials from the Games; the use of the Olympic flag and Olympic Anthem in place of the Russian flag and anthem; and the submission of a replacement logo for the OAR uniforms.[117]\n\n\nBy early January 2018, the IOC had banned 43 Russian athletes from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics and all future Olympic Games (as part of the Oswald Commission). Of those athletes, 42 appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and 28 of the appeals were successful, but eleven of the athletes had their sanctions upheld due to the weight of evidence against them. The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. Hearings for the remaining three athletes were postponed.[118]\n\n\nThe eventual number of neutral Russian athletes that participated at the 2018 Games was 168. These were selected from an original pool of 500 athletes that was put forward for consideration and, in order to receive an invitation to the Games, they were obliged to meet a number of pre-games conditions. Two athletes, who met the conditions and were cleared by the IOC, subsequently failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin and other officials had signalled in the past that it would be a humiliation if Russian athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag.[119] However, there were never actually any official plans to boycott the 2018 Games[116] and in late 2017 the Russian government agreed to allow their athletes to compete at the Games as individuals under a neutral designation.[120][121] Despite this public show of co-operation, there were numerous misgivings voiced by leading Russian politicians, including a statement from Putin himself saying that he believed the United States had used its influence within the IOC to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\".[122] 86% of the Russian population opposed participation at the Olympics under a neutral flag,[123] and many Russian fans attended the Games wearing the Russian colors and chanting \"Russia!\" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.[124]\n\n\nThe IOC's decision was heavily criticized by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), in whose opinion the judgement was commercially and politically motivated. He argued that not only was doping rife among Russian athletes but that there was no sign of it being eradicated.[125] The CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was also fiercely criticized, by Olympic officials, IOC president Thomas Bach and whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov's lawyer.[126]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2018 Winter Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in South Korea\n\t+ 1988 Summer Olympics – Seoul\n\t+ 2018 Winter Olympics – Pyeongchang\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* Soohorang and Bandabi\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Including United Korean (COR) women's ice hockey team.\n2. **^** \"French and English are the official languages for the Olympic Games.\", [1].(..)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Who won Team Canada's 29 medals in PyeongChang?\". *olympic.ca*. 25 February 2018.

This marked the second time that South Korea had hosted the Olympic Games (having previously hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul), as well as the first time it hosted the Winter Olympics. The 2018 Games marked the third time that an Asian country had hosted the Winter Olympics, after Sapporo 1972 and Nagano 1998, both in Japan. It was also the first Winter Olympics held in mainland Asia, and the first of three consecutive Olympic Games held in East Asia, preceding the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan and the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics in China.\n\n\nThe 2018 Games featured 102 events over 15 disciplines, a record number of events for the Winter Games. This is the first edition in Winter Olympic Games history to feature more than 100 medal events, four of which made their Olympic debut in 2018: \"big air\" snowboarding, mass start speed skating, mixed doubles curling, and mixed team alpine skiing. A total of 2,914 athletes from 93[note 1] teams competed, with the national debuts of Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.\n\n\nAfter a state-sponsored doping program was exposed following the 2014 Winter Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee was suspended, but selected athletes were allowed to compete neutrally under the special IOC designation of \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR), provided they could meet certain anti-doping requirements. North Korea agreed to participate in the Games in spite of tense relations with South Korea. The two nations paraded together at the opening ceremony as a unified Korea, and fielded a unified team (COR) in the women's ice hockey.\n\n\nSouth Korea ranked seventh overall at the 2018 Winter Games, with five gold medals and 17 overall medals. South Korea has traditionally been a country that won many medals in short track speed skating, but in this competition, it also won medals in skeleton racing, curling and skiing. South Korea's Yun Sung-Bin won a gold medal in men's skeleton racing, the first Olympic gold ever won by Asia in the sledding event. Norway led the total medal tally with 39, followed by Germany at 31 and Canada at 29.[1] Germany and Norway were tied for the highest number of gold medals, both winning 14.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding and election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Pyeongchang's award card, announced by the IOC's honorary president Jacques Rogge\n![](image)Woljeongsa in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do\n![](image)Sangwonsa in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do\nPyeongchang was elected as the host city at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa, on 6 July 2011, earning the necessary majority of at least 48 votes in just one round of voting.[2] Winning 63 of the 95 votes cast in the first secret ballot, Pyeongchang received more votes than its competitors combined, overwhelmingly beating Munich in Germany, which received 25 votes, and Annecy in France, which received seven.[3][4]\n\n\nThis was South Korea's third consecutive bid for the Winter Olympics, having been defeated by Vancouver and Sochi respectively in the final rounds of voting for the 2010 and 2014 Games.[3] Earlier, PyeongChang lost to Vancouver with a difference of 3 votes in bidding the 2010 Olympics, and lost to Sochi with a difference of 4 votes in bidding the 2014 Olympics. Since then, South Korea made great progress in preparing to host the Winter Olympics and succeeded in hosting the 2018 Olympics after three challenges.[4]\n\n\nAfter winning the election, Pyeongchang became the third Asian city to host the Winter Olympics.[2][3] Also, South Korea became the second country in Asia to host both the Summer (1988 Seoul Olympics) and Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Winter Olympics bidding results[5]\n| City\n | Nation\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Pyeongchang** | **![](image) South Korea** | **63** |\n| Munich | ![](image) Germany | 25\n |\n| Annecy | ![](image) France | 7\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\n![Pyeongchang is located in South Korea](image)![Pyeongchang](image)\nPyeongchang\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Pyeongchang in South Korea\n\nOn 5 August 2011, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the formation of the Pyeongchang 2018 Coordination Commission.[6][7] On 4 October 2011, it was announced that the Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympics would be headed by Kim Jin-sun. The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues.[8] The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village.[9][10] In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul.[11]\n\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee met for an orientation with the Pyeongchang 2018 organizing committee in July 2012.[12] Then-IOC President Jacques Rogge visited Pyeongchang for the first time in February 2013.[13]\n\n\nThe Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games created Pyeongchang WINNERS in 2014 by recruiting university students living in South Korea to spread awareness of the Olympic Games through social networking services and news articles.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)2018 Olympics gold medal\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nThe design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 21 September 2017. Created by Lee Suk-woo, the design features a pattern of diagonal ridges on both sides, with the Olympic rings on the front, and the obverse showing the 2018 Olympics' emblem, the event name and the discipline. The edge of each medal is marked with extrusions of hangul alphabets, while the ribbons are made from a traditional South Korean textile.[15] Gold medals contained 99 percent of silver and 1 percent of gold, which is a traditional composition for Olympic gold medals. At 586 grams (20.7 oz) they were the heaviest medals in the Olympic history.[16][17]\n\n\n\n![](image)2018 Winter Olympics torch\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics torch relay\n\nThe torch relay started on 24 October 2017 in Greece and lasted for 101 days, ending at the start of the Olympics on 9 February 2018. The Olympic torch entered South Korea on 1 November 2017. There were 7,500 torch bearers to represent the combined Korean population of approximately 75 million people. There were also 2,018 support runners to guard the torch and act as messengers.\n\n\nThe torch and its bearers traveled by a diverse means of transportation, including by turtle ship in Hansando Island, sailboat on the Baengmagang River in Buyeo, marine cable car in Yeosu, zip-wire over Bamseom Island, steam train in the Gokseong Train Village, marine rail bike along the east coast in Samcheok, and by yacht in Busan Metropolitan City.\n\n\nThere were also robot torch relays in Jeju and Daejeon.[18]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic venues 2018\nMain article: Venues of the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Dragon Valley (Alpensia) Ski Resort\n![](image)Alpensia Resort and wind turbines in Pyeongchang\nMost of the outdoor snow events were held in the county of Pyeongchang, while some of the alpine skiing events took place in the neighboring county of Jeongseon. The indoor ice events were held in the nearby city of Gangneung.\n\n\n\n#### Pyeongchang (mountain cluster)[edit]\n\n\nThe Alpensia Sports Park in Daegwallyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang, was the focus of the 2018 Winter Olympics.[19][20] It was home to the Olympic Stadium,[21] the Olympic Village and most of the outdoor sports venues.\n\n\n\n* Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre – ski jumping, Nordic combined, snowboarding (big air)\n* Alpensia Biathlon Centre – biathlon\n* Alpensia Cross-Country Skiing Centre – cross-country skiing, Nordic combined\n* Alpensia Sliding Centre – luge, bobsleigh, skeleton\n* Yongpyong Alpine Centre – alpine skiing (slalom, giant slalom)\n\n\nAdditionally, a stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in Bongpyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang:\n\n\n\n* Phoenix Snow Park – freestyle skiing, snowboarding\n\n\nAnother stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in neighboring Jeongseon county:\n\n\n\n* Jeongseon Alpine Centre – alpine skiing (downhill, super-G, combined)\n\n\n#### Gangneung (coastal cluster)[edit]\n\n\nThe Gangneung Olympic Park, in the neighborhood of Gyo-dong in Gangneung city, includes four indoor sports venues, all in close proximity to one another.\n\n\n\n* Gangneung Hockey Centre – ice hockey (men's competition)\n* Gangneung Curling Centre – curling\n* Gangneung Oval[21] – long track speed skating\n* Gangneung Ice Arena – short track speed skating, figure skating\n\n\nIn addition, a stand-alone indoor sports venue was located in the grounds of Catholic Kwandong University.\n\n\n\n* Kwandong Hockey Centre – ice hockey (women's competition)\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nTicket prices for the 2018 Winter Olympics were announced in April 2016 and tickets went on sale in October 2016. Event tickets ranged in price from ₩20,000 South Korean won (approx. US$17) to ₩900,000 (~US$787) while tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies ranged from ₩220,000 (~US$192) to ₩1.5 million (~US$1311). The exact prices were determined through market research; around 50% of the tickets were expected to cost about ₩80,000 (~US$70) or less, and tickets in sports that are relatively unknown in the region, such as biathlon and luge, were made cheaper in order to encourage attendance. By contrast, figure skating and the men's ice hockey gold-medal game carried the most expensive tickets of the Games.[22]\n\n\nAs of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold.[23][24] However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold.[25]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Parade of Nations at 2018 Olympic opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018. The US$100 million facility was only intended to be used for the opening and closing ceremonies of these Olympics and the subsequent Paralympics; it was demolished following their conclusion.[26][27][28]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics featured 102 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports,[29] making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Six new events in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic program in Pyeongchang: men's and ladies' big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling, men's and ladies' mass start speed skating, and mixed team alpine skiing.[29][30]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Winter Olympic sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n* Bobsledding\n\t+ ![](image) Bobsleigh (3) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n* ![](image) Curling (3) (details)\n* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n | * ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n* Skating\n\t+ ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Short track speed skating (8) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Speed skating (14) (details)\n | * Skiing\n\t+ ![](image) Alpine skiing (11) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Freestyle skiing (10) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Ski jumping (4) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Snowboarding (10) (details)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.*\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record total of 93[note 1] teams qualified at least one athlete to compete in the Games. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Six nations made their Winter Olympics debuts: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.[31] Athletes from three further countries – the Cayman Islands, Dominica, and Peru – qualified to compete, but all three National Olympic Committees returned the quota spots back to the International Ski Federation (FIS).[32]\n\n\nUnder a historic agreement facilitated by the IOC, qualified athletes from North Korea were allowed to cross the Korean Demilitarized Zone into South Korea to compete in the Games.[33][34][35] The two nations marched together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][37] A unified Korean team, consisting of 12 players from North Korea and 23 from South Korea, competed in the women's ice hockey tournament under a special IOC country code designation (COR) following talks in Panmunjom on 17 January 2018.[36] The two nations also participated separately: the South Korea team competed in every sport, while the North Korea team competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and short track speed skating.[38]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended due to the Russian doping scandal and the investigation into the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Individual Russian athletes, who qualified and could demonstrate they had complied with the IOC's doping regulations, were given the option to compete at the 2018 Games as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) under the Olympic flag and with the Olympic anthem played at any ceremony.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the

Korea and South Korea formed a unified Korean women's ice hockey team.  \n\nb Russian athletes were entitled to participate as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) if individually cleared by the IOC.\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nThe IOC has allowed NBC to influence the Olympic event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible, due to the substantial fees paid by NBC for rights to the Olympics (which have been extended through 2032 with a nearly $8 billion agreement), the company being one of IOC's major sources of revenue.[46][47] As figure skating is one of the most popular Winter Olympic sports among U.S. viewers, the figure skating events were scheduled with morning start times to accommodate primetime broadcasts in the Americas. This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions.[48]\n\n\nConversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.[49]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n*All dates are KST (UTC+9)*\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

Records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n* Noriaki Kasai of Japan became the first athlete in history to participate in eight Winter Olympics when he took part in the ski jumping qualification the day before the opening of the Games.[54] The previous record of seven Winter Olympics was held by Russian luger Albert Demchenko.\n* Japanese athlete Yuzuru Hanyu became the fourth male figure skater (after Gillis Grafström, Karl Schäfer, and Dick Button) to win two consecutive Olympic gold medals.\n* American Nathan Chen became the first figure skater to land five quadruple jumps in one program.[55]\n* German figure skaters Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot set a new ISU best free skating score of 159.31 in pair skating.[56]\n* Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir became the most decorated figure skaters in Olympic history with a total of 5 medals.\n* Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir set a new ISU best short dance score of 83.67[57] and a new ISU best combined total score of 206.07[58] in ice dance. French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron set a new ISU best free dance score of 123.35.[59]\n* Russian figure skater Alina Zagitova set a new ISU best short program score of 82.92 in Ladies' single skating.[60]\n* Dutch speed skater Sven Kramer won gold in the men's 5000 m event, becoming the only male speed skater to win the same Olympic event three times. He was also the first man to win a total of eight Olympic medals in speed skating.[61]\n* Dutch speed skater Ireen Wüst won an individual gold medal for the fourth Olympics in a row, the first time this had been achieved by a Winter Olympian. She also became the first speed skater (male or female) to win ten Winter Olympic medals and the first female Winter Olympian to win nine individual medals.[62]\n* Chinese short track speed skater Wu Dajing beat the men's 500 m world record twice en route to winning a gold medal, becoming only the second person in history to skate the discipline in under 40 seconds (after American J. R. Celski), and the first to achieve this at \"sea level\".[63]\n* Dutch athlete Jorien ter Mors became the first female athlete to win Olympic medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games;[64] she won a speed skating gold medal in the 1000 m and she was also part of the Dutch short track team that won bronze in the 3000 m relay.\n* Ester Ledecká of the Czech Republic won gold in the super-G skiing event and another gold in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom, making her the first female athlete to win Olympic gold medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games.[65]\n* Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen won bronze in the women's team sprint and gold in the 30 km classical event, bringing her total Olympic medal haul to fifteen, the most won by any athlete (male or female) in Winter Olympics history.[66] The record was previously held by fellow Norwegian athlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen who has thirteen Olympic medals.\n* Germany and Canada tied for gold in the two-man bobsleigh event, only the second time in history that two countries had tied for a gold medal in this particular event, the first time being in the 1998 Winter Olympics twenty years earlier.[67]\n* Norway won a total of 39 medals, setting a new record for the highest number of medals won at a single Winter Olympics. Their 39th medal was the last gold medal won by cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen in the 30 km classical event. The record was previously held by the USA who won 37 medals in Vancouver 2010.[68]\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 25 February 2018. IOC president Thomas Bach declared the Games closed, and the cauldron was extinguished. The Olympic flag was handed to Beijing, the next host city of the Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of 2018 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nBroadcast rights to the 2018 Winter Olympics were already sold in some countries as part of long-term broadcast rights deals, including the Games' local rightsholder SBS, which in July 2011 had extended its rights to the Olympics through 2024.[69] SBS sub-licensed its rights to MBC and KBS.[70]\n\n\nOn 29 June 2015, the IOC announced that Discovery Communications (now Discovery, Inc.) had acquired exclusive rights to the Olympics across all of Europe (excluding Russia) from 2018 through 2024. Discovery's pan-European Eurosport channels were promoted as the main broadcaster of the Games, but Discovery's free-to-air channels such as DMAX in Spain,[71] Kanal 5 in Sweden, and TVNorge in Norway, were also involved in the overall broadcasting arrangements.[72] Discovery was required to sub-license at least 100 hours of coverage to free-to-air broadcasters in each market;[73][74] some of these agreements required certain sports to be exclusive to Eurosport and its affiliated networks.[75] The deal did not initially cover France due to the broadcast rights of France Télévisions, which run through to the 2020 Games.[76] In the United Kingdom, Discovery held exclusive pay television rights under licence from the BBC, in return for the BBC sub-licensing the free-to-air rights to the 2022 and 2024 Olympics from Discovery.[77]\n\n\nRussian state broadcaster Channel One, and sports channel Match TV, committed to covering the Games with a focus on Russian athletes.[76] Russia was not affected by the Eurosport deal, due to a pre-existing contract held by a marketing agency which extends to 2024.[76]\n\n\nIn the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under a long-term contract (this would be the only time that the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics will be held on NBC on the same year).[78][79] On 28 March 2017, NBC announced that it would adopt a new format for its primetime coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, with a focus on live coverage in all time zones to take advantage of Pyeongchang's 14-hour difference with U.S. Eastern Time (and 17-hour difference with U.S. Pacific Time), and to address criticism of its previous tape delay practices. As before, the primetime block began at 8:00 p.m. ET (5:00 p.m. PT), and unlike previous Olympics, was available for streaming. Figure skating events were deliberately scheduled with morning sessions so they could be aired during primetime in the Americas (and in turn, NBC's coverage; due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible; NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on 7 May 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[46] is also one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC).[47][48] Coverage took a break in the East for late local news, after which coverage continued into \"Primetime Plus\", featuring additional live coverage into the Eastern late night and Western primetime hours.\n\n\nNHK and Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) once again filmed portions of the Games in high-dynamic-range 8K resolution video, including 90 hours of footage of selected events and the opening ceremonies.[80][81] ATSC 3.0 digital terrestrial television, using 4K resolution, was introduced in South Korea in 2017 in time for the Olympics.[82][83] This footage was delivered in 4K in the U.S. by NBCUniversal parent Comcast to participating television providers, including its own Xfinity, as well as DirecTV and Dish Network. NBC's Raleigh-based affiliate WRAL-TV also held demonstration viewings as part of its ATSC 3.0 test broadcasts.[84][85][86]\n\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics were used to showcase 5G wireless technologies, as part of a collaboration between domestic wireless sponsor KT, and worldwide sponsor Intel. Several venues were outfitted with 5G networks to facilitate features such as live camera feeds from bobsleds, and multi-camera views from cross-country and figure skating events. These were offered as part of public demonstrations coordinated by the two sponsors.[87][88]\n\n\nThe winners of the Olympic Golden Rings Awards were announced in June 2019. There were 75 pieces of broadcast content from the 2018 Olympics submitted over ten categories (plus one category for the 2018 Youth Olympics). NBC won a total of eight awards, winning four of the main categories: Best Olympic Feature, Best Olympic Digital Service, Best Olympic program and Best Documentary Film; they came second in the Best On-Air Promotion and Best Social Media Content/Production categories. Discovery/Eurosport won four categories: Best On-Air Promotion, Best Production Design, Best Innovation and Best Social Media Content/Production; they also came second in the Best Olympic Digital Service category. The BBC and NHK took the other two main awards: Most Sustainable Operation and Best Athlete Profile respectively. The title of Best Feature at the Youth Olympic Games Buenos Aires 2018 was also awarded to the BBC.[89]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics marketing\n\nThe official emblem, reflecting ice crystals and derived from the hangul letters ㅍ and ㅊ—the initial sounds of \"Pyeong\" and \"Chang\"—was unveiled on 3 May 2013.[90] In all official materials, the name of the host city was stylized in CamelCase as \"PyeongChang\", in order to alleviate potential confusion with Pyongyang, the similarly named capital of neighboring North Korea.[91]\n\n\nNew international sponsorship deals also debuted in Pyeongchang: Toyota was introduced as the new \"Mobility\" sponsor of the Olympics, although the company waived its domestic sponsorship to the local competitors Hyundai and Kia due to their support of the Pyeongchang bid.[92][93][94][95][96] Alibaba Group and Intel also debuted as e-commerce/cloud services and technology sponsors respectively.[97][98]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n### North–South Korean relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: North Korea–South Korea relations, 2017–18 North Korea crisis, and North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nDue to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests. On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games.[99] The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic, the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Protesters at Gwanghwamun Plaza, criticizing the event's pro-North Korean measures\nThe next day, Austria and Germany raised similar concerns and also threatened to skip the Games. France later reaffirmed its participation.[101] In early December 2017, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told Fox News that it was an \"open question\" whether the United States was going to participate in the Games, citing security concerns in the region.[102] However, days later the White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, stated that the United States would participate.[103]\n\n\nIn his New Year's address on 1 January 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un proposed talks in Seoul over the country's participation in the Games, which would be the first high-level talks between the North and South in over two years. Because of the talks, held on 9 January, North Korea agreed to field athletes in Pyeongchang.[104][105] On 17 January 2018, it was announced that North and South Korea had agreed to field a unified Korean women's ice hockey team at the Games, and to enter together under a Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][106]\n\n\nThese moves were met with opposition in South Korea, including protests and online petitions; critics argued that the government was attempting to use the Olympics to spread pro-North Korean sentiment, and that the unified ice hockey team would fail.[107] A rap video entitled \"The Regret for Pyeongchang\" (평창유감), which echoed this criticism and called the event the \"Pyongyang Olympics\", went viral in the country.[108] Japan's foreign affairs minister Tarō Kōno warned South Korea to be wary of North Korea's \"charm offensive\", and not to ease its pressure on the country.[36][109]\n\n\nThe South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, at the start of the Olympics shook hands with Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and a prominent figure of the regime. This marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea.[110][111] In contrast, U.S. vice president Mike Pence met with Fred Warmbier (father of Otto Warmbier, who had died after being released from captivity in North Korea) and a group of North Korean defectors in Pyeongchang.[112] American officials said that North Korea cancelled a meeting with Pence at the last minute.[113]\n\n\nAt the closing ceremony, North Korea sent general Kim Yong-chol as its delegate. His presence was met with hostility from South Korean conservatives, as there were allegations that he had a role in the ROKS *Cheonan* sinking and other past attacks. The Ministry of Unification stated that \"there is a limitation in pinpointing who was responsible for the incident.\" Although he is subject to sanctions, they did not affect his ability to visit the country for the Games.[114][115]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, Oswald Commission, Russian doping scandal after the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russian doping scandal at the 2016 Summer Olympics, and Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nRussia's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics was affected by the aftermath of its state-sponsored doping program. As a result, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in December 2017, although Russian athletes whitelisted by the IOC were allowed to compete neutrally under the OAR (Olympic Athletes from Russia) designation.[116] The official sanctions imposed by the IOC included: the exclusion of Russian government officials from the Games; the use of the Olympic flag and Olympic Anthem in place of the Russian flag and anthem; and the submission of a replacement logo for the OAR uniforms.[117]\n\n\nBy early January 2018, the IOC had banned 43 Russian athletes from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics and all future Olympic Games (as part of the Oswald Commission). Of those athletes, 42 appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and 28 of the appeals were successful, but eleven of the athletes had their sanctions upheld due to the weight of evidence against them. The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. Hearings for the remaining three athletes were postponed.[118]\n\n\nThe eventual number of neutral Russian athletes that participated at the 2018 Games was 168. These were selected from an original pool of 500 athletes that was put forward for consideration and, in order to receive an invitation to the Games, they were obliged to meet a number of pre-games conditions. Two athletes, who met the conditions and were cleared by the IOC, subsequently failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin and other officials had signalled in the past that it would be a humiliation if Russian athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag.[119] However, there were never actually any official plans to boycott the 2018 Games[116] and in late 2017 the Russian government agreed to allow their athletes to compete at the Games as individuals under a neutral designation.[120][121] Despite this public show of co-operation, there were numerous misgivings voiced by leading Russian politicians, including a statement from Putin himself saying that he believed the United States had used its influence within the IOC to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\".[122] 86% of the Russian population opposed participation at the Olympics under a neutral flag,[123] and many Russian fans attended the Games wearing the Russian colors and chanting \"Russia!\" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.[124]\n\n\nThe IOC's decision was heavily criticized by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), in whose opinion the judgement was commercially and politically motivated. He argued that not only was doping rife among Russian athletes but that there was no sign of it being eradicated.[125] The CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was also fiercely criticized, by Olympic officials, IOC president Thomas Bach and whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov's lawyer.[126]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2018 Winter Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in South Korea\n\t+ 1988 Summer Olympics – Seoul\n\t+ 2018 Winter Olympics – Pyeongchang\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* Soohorang and Bandabi\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Including United Korean (COR) women's ice hockey team.\n2. **^** \"French and English are the official languages for the Olympic Games.\", [1].(..)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Who won Team Canada's 29 medals in PyeongChang?\". *olympic.ca*. 25 February 2018.

Rio de Janeiro was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009.\n\n\n11,238 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team.[2][3] With 306 sets of medals, the Games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America,[4] as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America (the second being 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina), and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5] These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.[3]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (121); the US team also won its 1,000th Summer Olympic gold medal overall. Great Britain finished second and became the first country to increase its tally of medals in the Olympiad immediately after being host nation in 2012.[6] China finished third in the medal table. Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\n![](image)A young girl adding her signature in support of Rio de Janeiro's candidacy.\n![Several people dressed in formal attire sit behind a bench. There are repeated graphics behind them.](image)The bid committee, led by Carlos Arthur Nuzman, giving a press conference.\nThe bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16 May 2007.[7] The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13 September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. Others included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time.[8]\n\n\nNawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense. It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign.\n> \n> — Jon Tibbs, a consultant on the Tokyo bid[10]\n> \n\n\nThe final voting was held in Copenhagen on 2 October 2009, with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favorites to secure the Games. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Summer Olympics bidding results[11]\n| **City** | **NOC** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** |\n|  **Rio de Janeiro** |  **![](image) Brazil** | 26\n | **46** | **66** |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | **28** | 29\n | 32\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | 22\n | 20\n | —\n |\n| Chicago | ![](image) United States | 18\n | —\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on AroundTheRings.com that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This came just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons.[12] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO.[13]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters–Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã–as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.[17]\n\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history. Fittings included about 80,000 chairs, 70,000 tables, 29,000 mattresses, 60,000 clothes hangers, 6,000 television sets and 10,000 smartphones.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Barra Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Barra Olympic Park\nThe Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca, in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The site was formerly occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepaguá Formula One circuit.[19]\n\n\nThe nine venues within the Olympic Park were:[20][21]\n\n\n\n* Carioca Arena 1 – basketball (capacity: 16,000)\n* Carioca Arena 2 – wrestling, judo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Carioca Arena 3 – fencing, taekwondo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Future Arena – handball (capacity: 12,000)\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre – diving, synchronized swimming, water polo (capacity: 5,000)\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium – swimming, water polo play-offs (capacity: 15,000)\n* Olympic Tennis Centre – tennis (capacity: 10,000 Main Court)\n* Rio Olympic Arena – gymnastics (capacity: 12,000)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome – track cycling (capacity: 5,000)\n\n\n#### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nAs well as the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and Maracanã and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília and Manaus.\n\n\n\n* ![Maracanã Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nMaracanã Stadium  \nRio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Olympic Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nOlympic Stadium   \n Rio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Arena da Amazônia Manaus, AM](image)\n\nArena da Amazônia  \nManaus, AM\n* ![Arena Corinthians São Paulo, SP](image)\n\nArena Corinthians  \nSão Paulo, SP\n* ![Arena Fonte Nova Salvador, BA](image)\n\nArena Fonte Nova  \nSalvador, BA\n* ![Estádio Nacional Brasília, DF](image)\n\nEstádio Nacional  \nBrasília, DF\n* ![Mineirão Belo Horizonte, MG](image)\n\nMineirão  \nBelo Horizonte, MG\n\n\n### Urban renovation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Rio de Janeiro\n\n![](image)Mauá Square, with the Museum of Tomorrow, designed by Santiago Calatrava, and the light rail.\nRio's historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as *Porto Maravilha*, covering 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi) in area. The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increase the city center's attractiveness, and enhance Rio's competitive position in the global economy.[22]\n\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700 km (430 mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4 km (2.5 mi) of tunnels; 70 km (43 mi) of roads; 650 km2 (250 sq mi) of sidewalks; 17 km (11 mi) of bike path; 15,000 trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.[24][25]\n\n\nIn May 2017, an Associated Press article disclosed that over 100 athletes who had won medals at the Rio Olympics reported that their medals were showing some damage, including black spots, flaking, or surface degrading. Rio officials offered to replace any defective medals and found problems with 6 to 7 percent of all those awarded.[26]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)Basketball player Anderson Varejão carrying the torch in São Paulo\n![](image)Volunteers working at the Olympic Stadium during the Games\nThe Olympic flame was lit on 21 April 2016 at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay. The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on 27 April. A brief stop-off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva.[27]\n\n\nThe torch relay began its journey around Brazil on 3 May at the capital Brasília. The flame visited more than 300 Brazilian cities, including all 26 state capitals and the Brazilian Federal District.[28] The relay ended in Rio de Janeiro on 5 August when the flame was used to light the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony.\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012. More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014. The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site.[29] Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals.[30]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in Brazilian reais (BRL). A total of 7.5 million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. About 3.8 million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Future Arena, a temporary venue designed for future reconstruction into school buildings\nAs an aspect of its bid, Rio's organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the 2016 Games, going on to dub them a \"Green Games for a Blue Planet\".[33] As legacy projects, organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio's sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay,[33][34] and plant 24 million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games. However, some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls, leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them.[33][35]\n\n\nThe focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols. To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\nThe Future Arena, the venue for the handball competitions, was designed as a temporary modular structure whose components could be reconstructed after the Games to build schools.[38] However, as of November 2017, the arena was still standing due to lack of funds to dismantle it and no allocation of funds to do so in the 2018 budget.[39] Portions of the opening ceremony were dedicated to the issue of climate change.[40]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)A scene from the opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracana Stadium on 5 August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington.[41] The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming.[40][42] The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion.[4]\n\n\nThe ceremony included the inaugural presentation of the Olympic Laurel, an honor bestowed by the IOC on those that have made \"significant achievements in education, culture, development and peace through sport\"; the trophy was awarded to Kenyan athlete Kipchoge Keino.[43] The Games were officially opened by the acting president of Brazil, Michel Temer.[44]\n\n\nThe Olympic cauldron was lit by long-distance runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima,[4] the men's marathon bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympics, who had also received the IOC's Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship after being attacked by a spectator and losing his lead in the race.[41][45] The cauldron was originally expected to be lit by Brazilian footballer Pelé, but he declined to participate due to health problems.[42][46][47]\n\n\nFollowing the opening ceremony, a public cauldron was lit in front of the Candelária Church by Jorge Gomes, a 14-year-old Brazilian athlete who had escaped from poverty to train as a runner.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Youth Arena\n![](image)Deodoro Stadium\n![](image)Olympic BMX Centre\n![](image)Olympic Golf Course\nThe 2016 Summer Olympic program featured 28 sports encompassing 306 events.

Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.[50]\n\n\nIn August, the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens—a seven-player version of rugby union—by a majority vote; baseball/softball, roller sports, and squash were removed from contention, leaving golf, karate, and rugby sevens in the running. A final vote was held on 9 October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.[51][52]\n\n\nThe 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme.[53] The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against,[54] and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26.[55] Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.\n\n\nIn May 2012, the International Sailing Federation announced that windsurfing would be replaced by kitesurfing at the 2016 Olympics,[56] but this decision was reversed in November.[57]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rio 2016 Olympic Village\nAll 205 National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete.[*citation needed*] The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games.[58]\n\n\nAs host nation, Brazil received automatic entry for some sports including in all cycling disciplines and six places for weightlifting events.[59][60]\n\n\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics were the first Games in which Kosovo and South Sudan were eligible to participate. Bulgarian and Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti-doping violations.[61][62]\n\n\nKuwait was banned in October 2015 for the second time in five years over government interference in the country's Olympic committee.[63]\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Country by team size\n![](image)Participating countries color code  \nBlue = Participated for the first time in 2016.  \n Green

crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag. During the previous Summer Olympic Games, refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs.[64] On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Independent athletes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nDue to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\nIn November 2015, Russia was provisionally suspended from all international track and field athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) following a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report into a doping program in the country.[66] The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for \"exceptional eligibility\" to participate in the Games as \"neutral\" athletes if it was independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program.[67]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2016, the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA's recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally, stating that the Olympic Charter \"does not foresee such 'neutral athletes'\" and that it was each country's National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing.[68] As a result, Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag, although they would compete under a neutral flag in the 2018 Winter Olympics following several developments concerning the doping investigation.\n\n\n\n#### National houses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Nation | Location | Name\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa House |

the 2016 Summer Olympics. The records were set in archery, athletics, canoeing, cycling track, modern pentathlon, rowing, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting.\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The public cauldron, located outside the Candelária Church\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016),[71][72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET, 9:00 p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country.[73][74][75][76]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\n![](image)2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony at Maracanã Stadium\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracanã Stadium.[77] As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games' organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.[78]\n\n\nThe creative director for the ceremony was Rosa Magalhães.[79] Amid heavy rainfall, the ceremony began with interpretive dancers representing various landmarks in the host city. Martinho da Vila then performed a rendition of \"Carinhoso [pt]\" by Pixinguinha. In another segment, introducing the athletes, singer Roberta Sá channeled Carmen Miranda, the fruit-headdress-wearing, mid-century Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved camp figure. The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of 27 children, representing the states of Brazil, sang the Brazilian national anthem.\n\n\n\n### Cost[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.[80]\n\n\nIndirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics' cost of US$4.6 billion compares with costs of US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.[80]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBarra Olympic Park\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below.

Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster.[81] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats.[82] In the United States, NBC offered 4K content downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support, to participating television providers.[83] Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics to Grupo Globo. Replacing Record, the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo, pay TV, and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with Rede Bandeirantes. IOC board member Richard Carrión described the agreement as \"unprecedented\", touting that \"by working with Brazil's leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games.\"[84]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic rings displayed in Rio de Janeiro\nIn November 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis. The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo's show *Esporte Espetacular* finished third, and CCTV from China feature *A Sequel of Love* came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature *The Most Beautiful Thing*. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam. TV Globo went one better than the previous category coming second with their profile of Isaquias Queiroz. The winner of the category again was NBC, this time for their piece on Wayde van Niekerk. The Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places. The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV/Globosat, while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium.[85]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vinicius and Tom\n\n![](image)Vinicius (left), the mascot of the Rio 2016, and Tom (right), the mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics\nOn 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by Sao Paulo-based animation company Birdo.[86] The Olympic mascot Vinicius, named after musician Vinicius de Moraes, represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats, monkeys, and birds.[86] According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\".[87]\n\n\nBrand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots were intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil's culture and people.[88] The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote whose results were announced on 14 December 2014. The names, which reference the co-writers of the song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", won over two other sets of names, tallying 44 percent of 323,327 votes.[89] At the Olympic wrestling events, coaches were given plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee's call.[90]\n\n\n\n### Emblem[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sculpture of the *Rio 2016* logo in Barra Olympic Park\nThe official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tatíl Design and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies.[91] The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet, with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain. It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics.[92]\n\n\nThe logo has been noted as evoking Henri Matisse's painting *Dance*. There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own; while also consisting of several figures linked in motion, the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures. This was not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event; in 2004, the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of Carnival celebrations in Salvador. Gelli defended the allegations, stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original, as it was \"an ancient reference\" and \"in the collective unconscious\". Gelli cited *Dance* as an influence of the logo's concept and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible.[93]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThe lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies, including: Brazil's political and economic crisis; the Zika virus epidemic; the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia, which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games. However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics,[94] and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n### Political and economic crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Brazilian economic crisis, Operation Car Wash, and Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff\n\n![](image)Suspended president Dilma Rousseff during an interview with Al Jazeera at the Alvorada Palace on 1 June 2016\nIn 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters,[98] both anti- and pro-Rousseff.[99][100] At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop. On 12 May 2016, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games.[101]\n\n\nOn 5 October 2017, Brazilian Olympic Committee head Carlos Nuzman was arrested amid a money-laundering investigation into a $2 million payment that was allegedly made to secure votes for the bid to bring the Olympics to Rio. The money was believed to have been paid to former IAAF president Lamine Diack and his son Papa Massata Diack, who was a member of the IOC at the time of the alleged payment, which was three days before the vote in 2009. All three were charged with money laundering, along with the former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral (who was already in prison for money laundering offenses at the time), Brazilian businessman Arthur Soares, and ex-Brazilian Olympic Committee chief Leonardo Gryner. All six were charged with running a criminal organization, money laundering, and violating currency laws in their own native countries.[102] On 4 July 2019, it was reported that Cabral told a judge that the money paid to Diack was used to buy as many as nine votes.[103] Rio mayor Eduardo Paes was also accused of corruption and fraud in relation to the construction of a number of venues for the Games.[104][105]\n\n\n\n### Zika virus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic\n\n![](image)Agent for endemic diseases of the city of Votuporanga, São Paulo\nAn outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues.[106] Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games.[107]\n\n\nIn May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization (WHO), calling upon them to, according to co-author Arthur Caplan, have \"an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil\". The WHO dismissed the request, stating that \"cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics [would] not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus\", and that there was \"no public health justification\" for postponing them.[108][109][110]\n\n\nSome athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic.[111][112] On 2 September 2016, however, the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the 2016 Olympics.[113]\n\n\n\n### Environmental problems[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Brazil and Water supply and sanitation in Brazil\n\n![](image)Fort Copacabana hosted the cycling road race (start and finish), marathon swimming and triathlon events.\nThe Guanabara Bay, whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue. At the Earth Summit in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay.[114][115] However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues.[34] Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated;[116] this raw sewage also leaked into the bay. Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated,[117] at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics.[118]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Crime in Brazil and Terrorism in Brazil\n\n![](image)F-5EM Tiger II fighter jet of the Brazilian Air Force during an air intercept training for Rio 2016\nRio's crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the 2016 Games; mayor Paes stated that the city was facing \"big issues\" in heightening security, but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process.[119]\n\n\nThe governor of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems, with a terrorist attack occurring just a day after it was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics. The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.[120]\n\n\nOn 21 July 2016, two weeks before the scheduled start of the Games, the Brazilian Federal Police broke up an Islamic jihadist terrorist ring by arresting 12 people.[121]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Doping in Russia and McLaren Report\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the Russian Olympic Committee in Moscow\nIn December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report, and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work, and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.[122] After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren, which found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\".[123]\n\n\nIn response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[124] The IOC rejected the recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport's international federation would make decisions on each athlete's individual basis.[125][126] A day before the opening ceremony, 278 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 111 were removed because of doping.[127] In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag for a non-doping related matter.[128][129] Unlike the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee after it found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.[130]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2016 Summer Paralympics\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The official logo of the 2016 Summer Olympics was made in 3D design, made by Brazilian design company Tàtil Design; it was inspired by Brazil's rich history of festivals and its colorful people; it also symbolizes energy, passion and unity.

Rio de Janeiro was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009.\n\n\n11,238 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team.[2][3] With 306 sets of medals, the Games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America,[4] as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America (the second being 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina), and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5] These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.[3]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (121); the US team also won its 1,000th Summer Olympic gold medal overall. Great Britain finished second and became the first country to increase its tally of medals in the Olympiad immediately after being host nation in 2012.[6] China finished third in the medal table. Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\n![](image)A young girl adding her signature in support of Rio de Janeiro's candidacy.\n![Several people dressed in formal attire sit behind a bench. There are repeated graphics behind them.](image)The bid committee, led by Carlos Arthur Nuzman, giving a press conference.\nThe bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16 May 2007.[7] The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13 September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. Others included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time.[8]\n\n\nNawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense. It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign.\n> \n> — Jon Tibbs, a consultant on the Tokyo bid[10]\n> \n\n\nThe final voting was held in Copenhagen on 2 October 2009, with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favorites to secure the Games. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Summer Olympics bidding results[11]\n| **City** | **NOC** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** |\n|  **Rio de Janeiro** |  **![](image) Brazil** | 26\n | **46** | **66** |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | **28** | 29\n | 32\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | 22\n | 20\n | —\n |\n| Chicago | ![](image) United States | 18\n | —\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on AroundTheRings.com that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This came just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons.[12] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO.[13]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters–Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã–as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.[17]\n\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history. Fittings included about 80,000 chairs, 70,000 tables, 29,000 mattresses, 60,000 clothes hangers, 6,000 television sets and 10,000 smartphones.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Barra Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Barra Olympic Park\nThe Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca, in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The site was formerly occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepaguá Formula One circuit.[19]\n\n\nThe nine venues within the Olympic Park were:[20][21]\n\n\n\n* Carioca Arena 1 – basketball (capacity: 16,000)\n* Carioca Arena 2 – wrestling, judo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Carioca Arena 3 – fencing, taekwondo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Future Arena – handball (capacity: 12,000)\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre – diving, synchronized swimming, water polo (capacity: 5,000)\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium – swimming, water polo play-offs (capacity: 15,000)\n* Olympic Tennis Centre – tennis (capacity: 10,000 Main Court)\n* Rio Olympic Arena – gymnastics (capacity: 12,000)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome – track cycling (capacity: 5,000)\n\n\n#### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nAs well as the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and Maracanã and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília and Manaus.\n\n\n\n* ![Maracanã Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nMaracanã Stadium  \nRio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Olympic Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nOlympic Stadium   \n Rio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Arena da Amazônia Manaus, AM](image)\n\nArena da Amazônia  \nManaus, AM\n* ![Arena Corinthians São Paulo, SP](image)\n\nArena Corinthians  \nSão Paulo, SP\n* ![Arena Fonte Nova Salvador, BA](image)\n\nArena Fonte Nova  \nSalvador, BA\n* ![Estádio Nacional Brasília, DF](image)\n\nEstádio Nacional  \nBrasília, DF\n* ![Mineirão Belo Horizonte, MG](image)\n\nMineirão  \nBelo Horizonte, MG\n\n\n### Urban renovation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Rio de Janeiro\n\n![](image)Mauá Square, with the Museum of Tomorrow, designed by Santiago Calatrava, and the light rail.\nRio's historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as *Porto Maravilha*, covering 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi) in area. The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increase the city center's attractiveness, and enhance Rio's competitive position in the global economy.[22]\n\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700 km (430 mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4 km (2.5 mi) of tunnels; 70 km (43 mi) of roads; 650 km2 (250 sq mi) of sidewalks; 17 km (11 mi) of bike path; 15,000 trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.[24][25]\n\n\nIn May 2017, an Associated Press article disclosed that over 100 athletes who had won medals at the Rio Olympics reported that their medals were showing some damage, including black spots, flaking, or surface degrading. Rio officials offered to replace any defective medals and found problems with 6 to 7 percent of all those awarded.[26]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)Basketball player Anderson Varejão carrying the torch in São Paulo\n![](image)Volunteers working at the Olympic Stadium during the Games\nThe Olympic flame was lit on 21 April 2016 at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay. The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on 27 April. A brief stop-off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva.[27]\n\n\nThe torch relay began its journey around Brazil on 3 May at the capital Brasília. The flame visited more than 300 Brazilian cities, including all 26 state capitals and the Brazilian Federal District.[28] The relay ended in Rio de Janeiro on 5 August when the flame was used to light the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony.\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012. More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014. The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site.[29] Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals.[30]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in Brazilian reais (BRL). A total of 7.5 million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. About 3.8 million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Future Arena, a temporary venue designed for future reconstruction into school buildings\nAs an aspect of its bid, Rio's organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the 2016 Games, going on to dub them a \"Green Games for a Blue Planet\".[33] As legacy projects, organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio's sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay,[33][34] and plant 24 million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games. However, some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls, leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them.[33][35]\n\n\nThe focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols. To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\nThe Future Arena, the venue for the handball competitions, was designed as a temporary modular structure whose components could be reconstructed after the Games to build schools.[38] However, as of November 2017, the arena was still standing due to lack of funds to dismantle it and no allocation of funds to do so in the 2018 budget.[39] Portions of the opening ceremony were dedicated to the issue of climate change.[40]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)A scene from the opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracana Stadium on 5 August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington.[41] The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming.[40][42] The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion.[4]\n\n\nThe ceremony included the inaugural presentation of the Olympic Laurel, an honor bestowed by the IOC on those that have made \"significant achievements in education, culture, development and peace through sport\"; the trophy was awarded to Kenyan athlete Kipchoge Keino.[43] The Games were officially opened by the acting president of Brazil, Michel Temer.[44]\n\n\nThe Olympic cauldron was lit by long-distance runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima,[4] the men's marathon bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympics, who had also received the IOC's Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship after being attacked by a spectator and losing his lead in the race.[41][45] The cauldron was originally expected to be lit by Brazilian footballer Pelé, but he declined to participate due to health problems.[42][46][47]\n\n\nFollowing the opening ceremony, a public cauldron was lit in front of the Candelária Church by Jorge Gomes, a 14-year-old Brazilian athlete who had escaped from poverty to train as a runner.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Youth Arena\n![](image)Deodoro Stadium\n![](image)Olympic BMX Centre\n![](image)Olympic Golf Course\nThe 2016 Summer Olympic program featured 28 sports encompassing 306 events.

Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.[50]\n\n\nIn August, the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens—a seven-player version of rugby union—by a majority vote; baseball/softball, roller sports, and squash were removed from contention, leaving golf, karate, and rugby sevens in the running. A final vote was held on 9 October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.[51][52]\n\n\nThe 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme.[53] The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against,[54] and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26.[55] Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.\n\n\nIn May 2012, the International Sailing Federation announced that windsurfing would be replaced by kitesurfing at the 2016 Olympics,[56] but this decision was reversed in November.[57]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rio 2016 Olympic Village\nAll 205 National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete.[*citation needed*] The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games.[58]\n\n\nAs host nation, Brazil received automatic entry for some sports including in all cycling disciplines and six places for weightlifting events.[59][60]\n\n\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics were the first Games in which Kosovo and South Sudan were eligible to participate. Bulgarian and Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti-doping violations.[61][62]\n\n\nKuwait was banned in October 2015 for the second time in five years over government interference in the country's Olympic committee.[63]\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Country by team size\n![](image)Participating countries color code  \nBlue = Participated for the first time in 2016.  \n Green

crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag. During the previous Summer Olympic Games, refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs.[64] On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Independent athletes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nDue to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\nIn November 2015, Russia was provisionally suspended from all international track and field athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) following a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report into a doping program in the country.[66] The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for \"exceptional eligibility\" to participate in the Games as \"neutral\" athletes if it was independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program.[67]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2016, the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA's recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally, stating that the Olympic Charter \"does not foresee such 'neutral athletes'\" and that it was each country's National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing.[68] As a result, Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag, although they would compete under a neutral flag in the 2018 Winter Olympics following several developments concerning the doping investigation.\n\n\n\n#### National houses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Nation | Location | Name\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa House |

the 2016 Summer Olympics. The records were set in archery, athletics, canoeing, cycling track, modern pentathlon, rowing, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting.\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The public cauldron, located outside the Candelária Church\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016),[71][72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET, 9:00 p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country.[73][74][75][76]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\n![](image)2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony at Maracanã Stadium\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracanã Stadium.[77] As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games' organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.[78]\n\n\nThe creative director for the ceremony was Rosa Magalhães.[79] Amid heavy rainfall, the ceremony began with interpretive dancers representing various landmarks in the host city. Martinho da Vila then performed a rendition of \"Carinhoso [pt]\" by Pixinguinha. In another segment, introducing the athletes, singer Roberta Sá channeled Carmen Miranda, the fruit-headdress-wearing, mid-century Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved camp figure. The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of 27 children, representing the states of Brazil, sang the Brazilian national anthem.\n\n\n\n### Cost[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.[80]\n\n\nIndirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics' cost of US$4.6 billion compares with costs of US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.[80]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBarra Olympic Park\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below.

Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster.[81] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats.[82] In the United States, NBC offered 4K content downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support, to participating television providers.[83] Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics to Grupo Globo. Replacing Record, the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo, pay TV, and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with Rede Bandeirantes. IOC board member Richard Carrión described the agreement as \"unprecedented\", touting that \"by working with Brazil's leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games.\"[84]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic rings displayed in Rio de Janeiro\nIn November 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis. The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo's show *Esporte Espetacular* finished third, and CCTV from China feature *A Sequel of Love* came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature *The Most Beautiful Thing*. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam. TV Globo went one better than the previous category coming second with their profile of Isaquias Queiroz. The winner of the category again was NBC, this time for their piece on Wayde van Niekerk. The Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places. The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV/Globosat, while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium.[85]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vinicius and Tom\n\n![](image)Vinicius (left), the mascot of the Rio 2016, and Tom (right), the mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics\nOn 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by Sao Paulo-based animation company Birdo.[86] The Olympic mascot Vinicius, named after musician Vinicius de Moraes, represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats, monkeys, and birds.[86] According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\".[87]\n\n\nBrand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots were intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil's culture and people.[88] The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote whose results were announced on 14 December 2014. The names, which reference the co-writers of the song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", won over two other sets of names, tallying 44 percent of 323,327 votes.[89] At the Olympic wrestling events, coaches were given plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee's call.[90]\n\n\n\n### Emblem[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sculpture of the *Rio 2016* logo in Barra Olympic Park\nThe official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tatíl Design and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies.[91] The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet, with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain. It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics.[92]\n\n\nThe logo has been noted as evoking Henri Matisse's painting *Dance*. There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own; while also consisting of several figures linked in motion, the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures. This was not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event; in 2004, the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of Carnival celebrations in Salvador. Gelli defended the allegations, stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original, as it was \"an ancient reference\" and \"in the collective unconscious\". Gelli cited *Dance* as an influence of the logo's concept and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible.[93]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThe lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies, including: Brazil's political and economic crisis; the Zika virus epidemic; the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia, which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games. However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics,[94] and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n### Political and economic crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Brazilian economic crisis, Operation Car Wash, and Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff\n\n![](image)Suspended president Dilma Rousseff during an interview with Al Jazeera at the Alvorada Palace on 1 June 2016\nIn 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters,[98] both anti- and pro-Rousseff.[99][100] At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop. On 12 May 2016, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games.[101]\n\n\nOn 5 October 2017, Brazilian Olympic Committee head Carlos Nuzman was arrested amid a money-laundering investigation into a $2 million payment that was allegedly made to secure votes for the bid to bring the Olympics to Rio. The money was believed to have been paid to former IAAF president Lamine Diack and his son Papa Massata Diack, who was a member of the IOC at the time of the alleged payment, which was three days before the vote in 2009. All three were charged with money laundering, along with the former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral (who was already in prison for money laundering offenses at the time), Brazilian businessman Arthur Soares, and ex-Brazilian Olympic Committee chief Leonardo Gryner. All six were charged with running a criminal organization, money laundering, and violating currency laws in their own native countries.[102] On 4 July 2019, it was reported that Cabral told a judge that the money paid to Diack was used to buy as many as nine votes.[103] Rio mayor Eduardo Paes was also accused of corruption and fraud in relation to the construction of a number of venues for the Games.[104][105]\n\n\n\n### Zika virus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic\n\n![](image)Agent for endemic diseases of the city of Votuporanga, São Paulo\nAn outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues.[106] Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games.[107]\n\n\nIn May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization (WHO), calling upon them to, according to co-author Arthur Caplan, have \"an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil\". The WHO dismissed the request, stating that \"cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics [would] not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus\", and that there was \"no public health justification\" for postponing them.[108][109][110]\n\n\nSome athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic.[111][112] On 2 September 2016, however, the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the 2016 Olympics.[113]\n\n\n\n### Environmental problems[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Brazil and Water supply and sanitation in Brazil\n\n![](image)Fort Copacabana hosted the cycling road race (start and finish), marathon swimming and triathlon events.\nThe Guanabara Bay, whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue. At the Earth Summit in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay.[114][115] However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues.[34] Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated;[116] this raw sewage also leaked into the bay. Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated,[117] at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics.[118]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Crime in Brazil and Terrorism in Brazil\n\n![](image)F-5EM Tiger II fighter jet of the Brazilian Air Force during an air intercept training for Rio 2016\nRio's crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the 2016 Games; mayor Paes stated that the city was facing \"big issues\" in heightening security, but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process.[119]\n\n\nThe governor of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems, with a terrorist attack occurring just a day after it was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics. The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.[120]\n\n\nOn 21 July 2016, two weeks before the scheduled start of the Games, the Brazilian Federal Police broke up an Islamic jihadist terrorist ring by arresting 12 people.[121]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Doping in Russia and McLaren Report\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the Russian Olympic Committee in Moscow\nIn December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report, and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work, and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.[122] After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren, which found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\".[123]\n\n\nIn response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[124] The IOC rejected the recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport's international federation would make decisions on each athlete's individual basis.[125][126] A day before the opening ceremony, 278 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 111 were removed because of doping.[127] In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag for a non-doping related matter.[128][129] Unlike the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee after it found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.[130]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2016 Summer Paralympics\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The official logo of the 2016 Summer Olympics was made in 3D design, made by Brazilian design company Tàtil Design; it was inspired by Brazil's rich history of festivals and its colorful people; it also symbolizes energy, passion and unity.

Opening rounds in certain events were held on 6 February 2014, the day before the opening ceremony.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach. Both the Olympics and Paralympics were organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It was the first Olympics to be held in a CIS state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was previously the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\n\nA record ninety-eight events in fifteen winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions—a total of twelve accounting for gender—were held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, women's ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochi's Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium, and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance; and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics were the most expensive Games in the history of the Olympics. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, major cost overruns caused this figure to expand to US$51 billion, more than three times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics and even surpassing the estimated cost of US$44 billion for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1 billion people worldwide.[1]\n\n\nIn 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late-2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up.[2][3][4] The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Fans celebrating Sochi's bid win\nSochi was elected on 4 July 2007 during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, defeating bids from Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea.[7] This is the first time that the Russian Federation has hosted the Winter Olympics.

This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing,[10] which hosted 3 times as many events.[11] Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.[12][13][14]\n\n\nIn its final budget published in June 2014, Olimpstroy—the state corporation that oversaw the Sochi Olympics development—reported the total allocated funds for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics of 1,524 billion rubles (US$49.5 billion).[15] However, only about a fifth of that budget ($10.8 billion) was directly related to the Olympic games, while the rest went into urban and regional regeneration and the conversion of the Sochi region into an all-year round sea and alpine resort.[15] The breakdown table below is based on a report that has analyzed the distribution of Olimpstroy's $49.5 billion budget. Estimates also suggest that additional unrecoverable operational costs (including for security) could have added another $3 billion.[15]\n\n\n\n### The breakdown of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics costs[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCosts breakdown[15]\n| Item\n | Cost\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| million RUB\n | million US$\n |\n| **Direct Olympics costs (a)+(b)+(c)** | **331,098** | **10,753** |\n| **(a) Olympic venues** | **221,592** | **7,197** |\n| ***Coastal Cluster*** | ***96,366*** | ***3,130*** |\n| Fisht Olympic Stadium\n | 18,994\n | 617\n |\n| Bolshoy Ice Dome\n | 10,102\n | 328\n |\n| Shayba Arena\n | 3,484\n | 113\n |\n| Adler Arena Skating Centre\n | 7,406\n | 241\n |\n| Iceberg Skating Palace\n | 8,127\n | 264\n |\n| Ice Cube Curling Centre\n | 735\n | 24\n |\n| Main Media Centre\n | 17,426\n | 566\n |\n| The Olympic Park\n | 9,871\n | 321\n |\n| Olympic Village (3000 places)\n | 12,217\n | 397\n |\n| A complex for Olympic partners (1285 apartments)\n | 8,003\n | 260\n |\n| ***Mountain Cluster*** | ***125,226*** | ***4,067*** |\n| Rosa Khutor Extreme Park (freestyle skiing, snowboarding)\n | 3,393\n | 110\n |\n| Rosa Khutor Alpine Skiing Centre\n | 11,911\n | 387\n |\n| Sanki Sliding Centre (bobsleigh, luge, skeleton)\n | 7,487\n | 243\n |\n| RusSki Gorki Jumping Centre (ski jumps, Nordic combined)\n | 9,889\n | 321\n |\n| Laura Centre (biathlon and cross-country) and Olympic Village (1100 places)\n | 74,525\n | 2,420\n |\n| Main Alpine Olympic Village (2600 places) at Rosa Khutor\n | 18,021\n | 585\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(b) Site preparation and supporting infrastructure** | **85,370** | **2,773** |\n| Key infrastructure for Olympic venues (roads, energy, water, waste, security), planning and other works\n | 81,413\n | 2,644\n |\n| SOCOG office building\n | 3,957\n | 129\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(c) Operational costs (part of)** | **24,135** | **784** |\n| Opening/closing ceremonies (equipment and organisation)\n | 3,444\n | 112\n |\n| Broadcasting and photo equipment\n | 13,330\n | 433\n |\n| Vehicles for visitors and logistics\n | 6,958\n | 226\n |\n| Live Sites city programme\n | 403\n | 13\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **INDIRECT COSTS (d)+(e)** | **1,193,348** | **38,758** |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(d) Skiing and tourist resorts** | **189,937** | **6,169** |\n| Gazprom Alpine Tourist Centre\n | 60,723\n | 1,972\n |\n| Rosa Khutor\n | 35,078\n | 1,139\n |\n| Gornaya Karusel/Gorky Gorod\n | 72,728\n | 2,362\n |\n| Alpika Service\n | 21,408\n | 695\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(e) Other projects** | **1,003,411** | **32,589** |\n| Hotels and health resorts\n | 130,755\n | 4,247\n |\n| Formula One racing\n | 11,982\n | 389\n |\n| Olympic University\n | 12,946\n | 420\n |\n| Combined road and railroad linking the two clusters\n | 317,224\n | 10,303\n |\n| Railways and rail terminals\n | 38,015\n | 1,235\n |\n| Road infrastructure\n | 189,532\n | 6,156\n |\n| Sochi Airport\n | 22,895\n | 744\n |\n| Sochi Seaport\n | 27,673\n | 899\n |\n| Housing projects\n | 11,379\n | 370\n |\n| Power generation and grids\n | 74,305\n | 2,413\n |\n| Gasification projects\n | 46,048\n | 1,496\n |\n| Other engineering, water, waste, telecommunications and other infrastructure\n | 104,912\n | 3,407\n |\n| Nature and culture parks\n | 11,346\n | 369\n |\n| Two hospitals\n | 4,399\n | 143\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **Total (a)+(b)+(c)+(d)+(e)** | **1,524,445** | **49,511** |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)\nSochi\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Sochi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in Europe.\n\n![](image)Sochi from space, showing locations of Olympic park and ski venues\nWith an average February temperature of 8.3 °C (46.9 °F) and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games.[16] Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games.[17] It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sochi Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the Sochi Olympic Park\n![](image)Panoramic view of the Sochi Olympic Park\nThe Sochi Olympic Park was built by the Black Sea coast in the Imeretinsky Valley, about 4 km (2.5 miles) from Russia's border with Abkhazia/Georgia.[18][19] The venues were clustered around a central water basin on which the Medals Plaza is built, allowing all indoor venues to be within walking distance. It also features \"The Waters of the Olympic Park\" (designed by California-based company WET), a choreographed fountain which served as the backdrop in the medals awards and the opening and closing ceremonies of the event.[20][21] The new venues include:[22]\n\n\n\n* Fisht Olympic Stadium – ceremonies (opening/closing) 40,000 spectators\n* Bolshoy Ice Dome – ice hockey (final), 12,000 spectators\n* Shayba Arena – ice hockey, 7,000 spectators\n* Adler Arena Skating Center – speed skating, 8,000 spectators\n* Iceberg Skating Palace – figure skating, short track speed skating, 12,000 spectators\n* Ice Cube Curling Center – curling, 3,000 spectators\n* Main Olympic village\n* International broadcasting centre and main press room\n\n\n![](image)\nA sketch of the layout of Sochi Olympic Park.\n\n### Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai\n\n![](image)Chairlift in Krasnaya Polyana\n* Laura Biathlon & Ski Complex – biathlon, cross-country skiing\n* Rosa Khutor Extreme Park – freestyle skiing and snowboarding\n* Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort – alpine skiing\n* Sliding Center Sanki – bobsleigh, luge and skeleton\n* RusSki Gorki Jumping Center – ski jumping and Nordic combined (both ski jumping and cross-country skiing on a 2 km route around the arena)\n* Roza Khutor plateau Olympic Village\n\n\n![](image)\n2014 Winter Olympics Mountain Cluster Venues (interactive map)\n\n### Post-Olympic usage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fisht Olympic Stadium under re-construction in 2015.\nA street circuit known as the Sochi Autodrom was constructed in and around Olympic Park. Its primary use is to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix, which held its inaugural edition in October 2014.[23][24]\n\n\nIn January 2015, work began on adapting Fisht Olympic Stadium into an open-air football stadium to host matches during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[25][26]\n\n\nA new ice hockey team in the Kontinental Hockey League, HC Sochi Leopards, now plays in Bolshoy Arena.\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics marketing\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vladimir Putin with George W. Bush and Laura Bush examining the models of the Olympic facilities for Sochi, April 2008\n![](image)100 Russian ruble banknote issued in 2013 by the Central Bank of Russia\nThe Olympic infrastructure was constructed according to a Federal Target Program (FTP). In June 2009, the Games' organizers reported they were one year ahead in building the main Olympic facilities as compared to recent Olympic Games.[27] In November 2011, IOC President Jacques Rogge was in Sochi and concluded that the city had made significant progress since he last visited eighteen months earlier.[28]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications in Russia\n\nAccording to the FTP, US$580 million would be spent on construction and modernization of telecommunications in the region. Avaya was named by the Sochi Organizing Committee as the official supplier of telecommunications equipment. Avaya provided the data network equipment, including switches, routers, security, telephones and contact-center systems. It provided engineers and technicians to design and test the systems, and worked with other technology partners to provide athletes, dignitaries and fans information about the Games.[29][30]\n\n\nThe 2014 Olympics is the first \"fabric-enabled\" Games using Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology.[31] The network is capable of handling up to 54 Tbit/s of traffic.[32]\n\n\nInfrastructure built for the games included:\n\n\n\n* A network of TETRA mobile radio communications for 100 user groups (with capacity of 10,000 subscribers);\n* 712 km (442 mi) of fiber-optic cables along the Anapa-Dzhubga-Sochi highways and Dzhubga–Krasnodar branch;\n* Digital broadcasting infrastructure, including radio and television broadcasting stations (building and communications towers) with coverage from Grushevaya Polyana (*Pear Glade*) to Sochi and Anapa cities. The project also included construction of infocommunications centre for broadcasting abroad via three HDTV satellites.\n\n\nDuring the Games, the core networks of Rostelecom and Transtelekom were used.[33]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the newest equipment for the television coverage of the Games arrived in the port of Adler. Prepared specifically for the Games, a team of regional specialists and the latest technology provide a qualitatively new level of television production in the region.[34]\n\n\nThe fiber-optic channel links Sochi between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana. The 46-kilometre-long (29 mi) channel enables videoconferencing and news reporting from the Olympics.[35]\n\n\nIn November 2013, it was reported that the fiber-optic cable that was built by the Federal Communications Agency, Rossvyaz, had no operator. With Rostelecom and Megafon both refusing to operate it, the line was transferred to the ownership of the state enterprise Center for Monitoring & Development of Infocommunication Technologies (Russian: Центр МИР ИТ).[36]\n\n\nRussian mobile phone operator Megafon expanded and improved Sochi's telecom infrastructure with over 700 new 2G/3G/4G cell towers. Sochi was the first Games to offer 4G connectivity at a speed of 10 MB/sec.\n\n\nIn January 2014, Rostelecom reported that it had connected the Olympic media center in Sochi to the Internet and organized channels of communication with the main media center of the Olympic Games in the coastal cluster and press center in Moscow. The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Power infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Night view of Sochi during the Olympics, taken by Expedition 38 members from the International Space Station\nA five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the Russian Ministry of Regional Development, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.[39]\n\n\nAccording to the strategy, the capacity of the regional energy network would increase by two and a half times by 2014, guaranteeing a stable power supply during and after the Games.\n\n\nThe power demand of Sochi at the end of May 2009 was 424 MW. The power demand of the Olympic infrastructure was expected to be about 340 MW.\n\n\n\n* Poselkovaya electrical substation became operational in early 2009.\n* Sochi thermal power station reconstructed (expected power output was 160 MW)\n* Laura and Rosa Khutor electrical substations were completed in November 2010\n* Mzymta electrical substation was completed in March 2011\n* Krasnopolyanskaya hydroelectric power station was completed in 2010\n* Adler CHP station design and construction was completed in 2012. Expected power output was 360 MW[40]\n* Bytkha substation, under construction[*when?*] with two transformers 25 MW each, includes dependable microprocessor-based protection\n\n\nEarlier plans also include building combined cycle (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of Tuapse and Novorossiysk and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the Black Sea.[41]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in Russia\n\nThe transport infrastructure prepared to support the Olympics includes many roads, tunnels, bridges, interchanges, railroads and stations in and around Sochi. Among others, 8 flyovers, 102 bridges, tens of tunnels and a bypass route for heavy trucks – 367 km (228 mi) of roads were paved.[42]\n\n\nThe Sochi Light Metro is located between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana connecting the Olympic Park, Sochi International Airport, and the venues in Krasnaya Polyana.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Park railway station\nThe existing 102 km (63-mile), Tuapse-to-Adler railroad was renovated to provide double track throughout, increasing capacity and enabling a reliable regional service to be provided and extending to the airport. In December 2009, Russian Railways ordered 38 Siemens Mobility Desiro trains for delivery in 2013 for use during the Olympics, with an option for a further 16 partly built in Russia.[44]\n\n\nAt Sochi International Airport, a new terminal was built along a 3.5 km (2.2-mile) runway extension, overlapping the Mzymta River.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sochi seaport\nAt the Port of Sochi, a new offshore terminal 1.5 km (0.93 mi) from the shore allows docking for cruise ships with capacities of 3,000 passengers.[46] The cargo terminal of the seaport would be moved from the centre of Sochi.\n\n\nRoadways were detoured, some going around the construction site and others being cut off.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)A \"Lastochka\" (Siemens Desiro) train, which serves the Tuapse–Sochi route\nIn May 2009, Russian Railways started the construction of tunnel complex No. 1 (the final total is six) on the combined road (automobile and railway) from Adler to Alpica Service Mountain Resort in the Krasnaya Polyana region. The tunnel complex No. 1 is located near Akhshtyr in Adlersky City District, and includes:[48]\n\n\n\n* Escape tunnel, 2.25 kilometres (1.40 mi), completed in 2010\n* Road tunnel, 2,153 metres (7,064 ft), completed in 2013\n* One-track railway tunnel, 2,473 metres (8,114 ft), completed in 2013\n\n\nRussian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin stated the road construction costed more than 200 billion rubles.[49]\n\n\nIn addition, Sochi's railway stations were renovated. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta, Khosta, Lazarevskaya, and Loo railway stations. In Adler, a new railway station was built while the original building was preserved, and in the Olympic park cluster, a new station was built from scratch, the Olympic Park railway station. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\n\n### Other infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sochi at night from space[50]\nFunds were spent on the construction of hotels for 10,300 guests.[51] The first of the Olympic hotels, Zvezdny (*Stellar*), was rebuilt anew.[52] Significant funds were spent on the construction of an advanced sewage treatment system in Sochi, designed by Olimpstroy. The system meets BREF standards and employs top available technologies for environment protection, including tertiary treatment with microfiltration.[53]\n\n\nSix post offices were opened at competition venues, two of them in the main media centre in Olympic Park and in the mountain village of Estosadok. In addition to standard services, customers had access to unique services including two new products, Fotomarka and Retropismo. Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylized sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one's own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and wax seal affixing. All the new sites and post offices in Sochi were opened during the Olympics until late night 7 days a week, and employees were trained to speak English.[54]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics torch relay\nTorch relay in Moscow\nOn 29 September 2013, the Olympic torch was lit in Ancient Olympia, beginning a seven-day journey across Greece and on to Russia, then the torch relay started at Moscow on 7 October 2013 before passing 83 Russian cities and arriving at Sochi on the day of the opening ceremony, 7 February 2014.[55] It is the longest torch relay in Olympic history, a 60,000-kilometre (40,000 mi) route that passes through all regions of the country, from Kaliningrad in the west to Chukotka in the east.\n\n\nThe Olympic torch reached the North Pole for first time via a nuclear-powered icebreaker *(50 Let Pobedy)*. The torch was also passed for the first time in space, though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed livery including the Games' emblem. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky waved the torch on a spacewalk outside the ISS. The torch returned to Earth five days later on board Soyuz TMA-09M.[56][57] The torch also reached Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and Siberia's Lake Baikal.[58]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony and 2014 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks over Fisht Olympic Stadium following the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron.\n![](image)The Olympic Rings at Sochi Olympic Park\nThe opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium, an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak, who exited the stadium to jointly light the Olympic cauldron located near the center of Olympic Park.[59][60][61][62]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record 88 nations qualified to compete,[63] which beat the previous record of 82 set at the previous Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Seven nations made their Winter Olympics debut: Dominica, Malta, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe.[64] The Winter debut of Malta meant that for the first time ever, all of the current members of the European Olympic Committees participated at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\nKristina Krone qualified to compete in her second consecutive games for Puerto Rico, but the island's Olympic Committee once again chose not to send her to compete.[65] Similarly, South Africa decided not to send alpine skier Sive Speelman to Sochi.[66] Algeria also did not enter its only qualified athlete, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi.[67]\n\n\nIndia's athletes originally competed as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony, as India was originally suspended in December 2012 over the election process of the Indian Olympic Association.[68] On 11 February, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward.[69] Although Shiva Keshavan competed as an Independent athlete and is recorded as such, he was permitted to walk under the flag of India at the Closing Ceremony.\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the Winter Olympics\nYellow circle is host city (Sochi)\n\n![](image)Number of participating

sports. A total of twelve new events were contested, making it the largest Winter Olympics to date.[83]\n\n\n\n1. **Biathlon**\n\t* ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n2. **Bobsleigh**\n\t* ![](image) Bobsleigh (3) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n3. **Curling**\n\t* ![](image) Curling (2) (details)\n4. **Ice hockey**\n\t* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n5. **Luge**\n\t* ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n6. **Skating**\n\t* ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Short track speed skating (8) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Speed skating (12) (details)\n7. **Skiing**\n\t* ![](image) Alpine skiing (10) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Freestyle skiing (10) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Ski jumping (4) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Snowboarding (10) (details)\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.*\n\n\n\n#### New events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Postage stamps of Transnistria, Sochi Olympic Games (2014)\nOn 6 April 2011, the IOC accepted a number of events that were submitted by their respective sports federations to be considered for inclusion into the official program of these Olympic Games.[84]\nThe events included a Figure skating team event, Women's ski jumping, Mixed relay biathlon, Ski half-pipe, and Team relay luge.\n\n\nOn 4 July 2011, the IOC announced that three events would be added to the program.[85] These events, which were officially declared by Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge on 4 July 2011, were: Ski slopestyle, Snowboard slopestyle, Snowboard parallel special slalom.[86]\n\n\nTeam alpine skiing was also presented as a candidate for inclusion in the Olympic program but the Executive board of the IOC rejected this proposal. The International Ski Federation persisted with the nomination and this was considered.[87] There were reports of bandy possibly being added to the sports program,[88][89][90] but the IOC rejected this request. Subsequently, the international governing body, Federation of International Bandy, decided that Irkutsk and Shelekhov in Russia would host the 2014 Bandy World Championship just before the Olympics.\n\n\nOn 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include ski mountaineering,[91] ski-orienteering,[92] or winter triathlon[93] in the review process of the program.[93]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 23 February 2014 between 20:14 MSK (UTC+4) and 22:25 MSK (UTC+4) at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.[94]\nThe ceremony was dedicated to Russian culture featuring world-renowned Russian stars like conductor and violinist Yuri Bashmet, conductor Valery Gergiev, pianist Denis Matsuev, singer Hibla Gerzmava and violinist Tatiana Samouil. These artists were joined by performers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theaters.\n\n\n\n## Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2014 Winter Olympics\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics medal winners\n\nSochi's medal design was unveiled in May 2013. The design is intended to resemble Sochi's landscape, with a semi-translucent section containing a \"patchwork quilt\" of diamonds representing mountains; the diamonds themselves contain designs that reflect Russia's regions.[95] Those who won gold medals on 15 February received special medals with fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor, marking the one-year anniversary of the event where pieces of the cosmic body fell into the Chebarkul Lake in the Ural Mountains in central Russia.[96]\n\n\n\n### Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics medal table\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below.

To enter controlled areas, visitors were required to pass through security checkpoints with X-ray machines, metal detectors and explosive material scanners.[101] Several areas were designated as \"forbidden\", including Sochi National Park and the border with Abkhazia.[100][102] An unmanned aerial vehicle squadron, along with S-400 and Pantsir-S1 air defense rockets were used to protect Olympic airspace. Four gunboats were also deployed on the Black Sea to protect the coastline.[103]\n\n\nA number of security organizations and forces began stationing in and around Sochi in January 2014; Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) was stationed in Sochi for the Games beginning on 7 January 2014.[104][105] A group of 10,000 Internal Troops of the Ministry of Interior also provided security services during the Games.[106] In mid-January, 1,500 Siberian Regional Command troops were stationed in a military town near Krasnaya Polyana.[107] A group of 400 Cossacks in traditional uniforms were also present to accompany police patrols.[108][109] The 58th Army unit of the Russian Armed Forces were defending the Georgia–Russia border.[110] The United States also supplied Navy ships and other assets for security purposes.[111]\n\n\nAll communication and Internet traffic by Sochi residents was captured and filtered through deep packet inspection systems at all mobile networks using the SORM system.[112][113]\n\n\nFormer professional speed skater and current deputy of the Russian State Duma Svetlana Zhurova has stated that the 2014 Sochi Olympics were Vladimir Putin's personal project to showcase Russia to the world.[114]\n\n\n\n### Incidents and threats[edit]\n\n\nOrganizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged \"on the bones of many, many Muslims killed ... and buried on our lands extending to the Red Sea\".[115]\n\n\nThreats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or \"blow up\" athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters \"[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public\", the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games.[110][116][117]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nIn most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters: Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.[118]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.[119]\n\n\nIn Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and Réseau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group's TVA Sports.[120][121][122][123]\n\n\nIn Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.[124][125][126]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSeveral broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing. Olympic sponsor Panasonic filmed the opening ceremony in 4K.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia's policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government's denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors.[131][132][133][134][135] Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history, with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials,[136] and Allison Stewart of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms.[137] It was reported that Putin's annexation of Crimea may have been intended to distract local Russians from corruption stories related to the Games.[138][139]\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. broadcaster NBC largely avoided broadcasting material critical of Russia, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some commentators.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the closing ceremony, commentators evaluated the Games to have been successful overall.[141][142]\n\n\n\n### Circassian genocide[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Circassians in Turkey commemorate the Circassian genocide in Taksim, Istanbul\nSome Circassian organizations objected to the Games being held on land their ancestors held until 1864,[143][144] when most of them were vanquished at the end of the Russian-Circassian War (1763–1864), in the Circassian genocide[145][146] The use of Krasnaya Polyana (\"Red Hill\" or \"Red Glade\") as an event site was considered insensitive, as it was named for a group of Circassians who were defeated in a bloody battle with Russians while attempting to return home over it in 1864.[147][148] Some Circassian groups demanded that the Games be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for their actions.[149] Other groups did not outright object to the Games, but suggested that symbols of Circassian history and culture be incorporated into the Games, as Australia, the United States and Canada did for their indigenous cultures in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.[150]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, and Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nFollowing the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD,[151] and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by *The New York Times*—which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.[152][153] Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.[152][153][154][155]\n\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commissioned an independent report by Richard McLaren, which corroborated claims that Russian authorities had been discreetly swapping out urine samples that tested positive for performance-enhancing substances. The report concluded that the program had been operating from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\", and had covered up 643 positive samples across Olympic and non-Olympic sports.[156][157][158] As a result, WADA considered the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[159]\n\n\nRussia was not banned from the 2016 Olympics by the IOC, a decision that was widely criticized by both athletes[160][161][162] and writers;[163][164][165] the IOC only required Russia's athletes to be cleared by an internal panel and their respective sports federations.[166] The IAAF had suspended Russia from international track and field events due to the scandal, but did allow Darya Klishina to participate in the Olympics because she was confirmed not to be a part of a doping program, despite claims that surfaced in her appeal that a sample of Klishina's that had been collected on 26 February 2014 had yielded an illegal testosterone/epitestosterone ratio of 8.5 had been subject\nto a \"SAVE\" order by the Ministry of Sport on 3 March 2014.[167][168][169] The International Paralympic Committee suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee and banned the team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics.[170]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, thus banning it from sending athletes under the Russian flag to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cleared Russian athletes were allowed to participate as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR).[5][6] Two of them – curler Alexander Krushelnitskiy, who won a bronze medal, and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva – failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nThe IOC's Oswald Commission disqualified and banned 43 Russian athletes, and stripped thirteen medals they earned in Sochi.[171] In December 2017, 42 of the 43 punished athletes appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On 1 February 2018, the CAS found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence and cleared 28 athletes from IOC sanctions. In total, Russian athletes won back 9 of the 13 medals collected. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics.[172] The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC found it important to note that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent” and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision.[173][174] Later that month, the Russian Olympic Committee was reinstated by the IOC, despite failed doping tests during the 2018 Olympics,[175] and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was re-certified in September, despite the Russian officials not accepting the McLaren report.[176]\n\n\n\n### Subsequent events[edit]\n\n\nJust 4 days after the closing of the Games, Russian troops entered Ukrainian Crimea and started the formal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Russia formally incorporated Crimea into its territory on 14th March 2014.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n* ![flag](image)Russia portal\n* ![icon](image)2010s portal\n\n\n* 2014 Winter Paralympics\n* 2014 Summer Youth Olympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Sochi 2014 Facts & figures\" (PDF).

Opening rounds in certain events were held on 6 February 2014, the day before the opening ceremony.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach. Both the Olympics and Paralympics were organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It was the first Olympics to be held in a CIS state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was previously the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\n\nA record ninety-eight events in fifteen winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions—a total of twelve accounting for gender—were held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, women's ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochi's Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium, and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance; and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics were the most expensive Games in the history of the Olympics. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, major cost overruns caused this figure to expand to US$51 billion, more than three times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics and even surpassing the estimated cost of US$44 billion for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1 billion people worldwide.[1]\n\n\nIn 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late-2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up.[2][3][4] The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Fans celebrating Sochi's bid win\nSochi was elected on 4 July 2007 during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, defeating bids from Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea.[7] This is the first time that the Russian Federation has hosted the Winter Olympics.

This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing,[10] which hosted 3 times as many events.[11] Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.[12][13][14]\n\n\nIn its final budget published in June 2014, Olimpstroy—the state corporation that oversaw the Sochi Olympics development—reported the total allocated funds for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics of 1,524 billion rubles (US$49.5 billion).[15] However, only about a fifth of that budget ($10.8 billion) was directly related to the Olympic games, while the rest went into urban and regional regeneration and the conversion of the Sochi region into an all-year round sea and alpine resort.[15] The breakdown table below is based on a report that has analyzed the distribution of Olimpstroy's $49.5 billion budget. Estimates also suggest that additional unrecoverable operational costs (including for security) could have added another $3 billion.[15]\n\n\n\n### The breakdown of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics costs[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCosts breakdown[15]\n| Item\n | Cost\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| million RUB\n | million US$\n |\n| **Direct Olympics costs (a)+(b)+(c)** | **331,098** | **10,753** |\n| **(a) Olympic venues** | **221,592** | **7,197** |\n| ***Coastal Cluster*** | ***96,366*** | ***3,130*** |\n| Fisht Olympic Stadium\n | 18,994\n | 617\n |\n| Bolshoy Ice Dome\n | 10,102\n | 328\n |\n| Shayba Arena\n | 3,484\n | 113\n |\n| Adler Arena Skating Centre\n | 7,406\n | 241\n |\n| Iceberg Skating Palace\n | 8,127\n | 264\n |\n| Ice Cube Curling Centre\n | 735\n | 24\n |\n| Main Media Centre\n | 17,426\n | 566\n |\n| The Olympic Park\n | 9,871\n | 321\n |\n| Olympic Village (3000 places)\n | 12,217\n | 397\n |\n| A complex for Olympic partners (1285 apartments)\n | 8,003\n | 260\n |\n| ***Mountain Cluster*** | ***125,226*** | ***4,067*** |\n| Rosa Khutor Extreme Park (freestyle skiing, snowboarding)\n | 3,393\n | 110\n |\n| Rosa Khutor Alpine Skiing Centre\n | 11,911\n | 387\n |\n| Sanki Sliding Centre (bobsleigh, luge, skeleton)\n | 7,487\n | 243\n |\n| RusSki Gorki Jumping Centre (ski jumps, Nordic combined)\n | 9,889\n | 321\n |\n| Laura Centre (biathlon and cross-country) and Olympic Village (1100 places)\n | 74,525\n | 2,420\n |\n| Main Alpine Olympic Village (2600 places) at Rosa Khutor\n | 18,021\n | 585\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(b) Site preparation and supporting infrastructure** | **85,370** | **2,773** |\n| Key infrastructure for Olympic venues (roads, energy, water, waste, security), planning and other works\n | 81,413\n | 2,644\n |\n| SOCOG office building\n | 3,957\n | 129\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(c) Operational costs (part of)** | **24,135** | **784** |\n| Opening/closing ceremonies (equipment and organisation)\n | 3,444\n | 112\n |\n| Broadcasting and photo equipment\n | 13,330\n | 433\n |\n| Vehicles for visitors and logistics\n | 6,958\n | 226\n |\n| Live Sites city programme\n | 403\n | 13\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **INDIRECT COSTS (d)+(e)** | **1,193,348** | **38,758** |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(d) Skiing and tourist resorts** | **189,937** | **6,169** |\n| Gazprom Alpine Tourist Centre\n | 60,723\n | 1,972\n |\n| Rosa Khutor\n | 35,078\n | 1,139\n |\n| Gornaya Karusel/Gorky Gorod\n | 72,728\n | 2,362\n |\n| Alpika Service\n | 21,408\n | 695\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(e) Other projects** | **1,003,411** | **32,589** |\n| Hotels and health resorts\n | 130,755\n | 4,247\n |\n| Formula One racing\n | 11,982\n | 389\n |\n| Olympic University\n | 12,946\n | 420\n |\n| Combined road and railroad linking the two clusters\n | 317,224\n | 10,303\n |\n| Railways and rail terminals\n | 38,015\n | 1,235\n |\n| Road infrastructure\n | 189,532\n | 6,156\n |\n| Sochi Airport\n | 22,895\n | 744\n |\n| Sochi Seaport\n | 27,673\n | 899\n |\n| Housing projects\n | 11,379\n | 370\n |\n| Power generation and grids\n | 74,305\n | 2,413\n |\n| Gasification projects\n | 46,048\n | 1,496\n |\n| Other engineering, water, waste, telecommunications and other infrastructure\n | 104,912\n | 3,407\n |\n| Nature and culture parks\n | 11,346\n | 369\n |\n| Two hospitals\n | 4,399\n | 143\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **Total (a)+(b)+(c)+(d)+(e)** | **1,524,445** | **49,511** |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)\nSochi\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Sochi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in Europe.\n\n![](image)Sochi from space, showing locations of Olympic park and ski venues\nWith an average February temperature of 8.3 °C (46.9 °F) and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games.[16] Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games.[17] It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sochi Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the Sochi Olympic Park\n![](image)Panoramic view of the Sochi Olympic Park\nThe Sochi Olympic Park was built by the Black Sea coast in the Imeretinsky Valley, about 4 km (2.5 miles) from Russia's border with Abkhazia/Georgia.[18][19] The venues were clustered around a central water basin on which the Medals Plaza is built, allowing all indoor venues to be within walking distance. It also features \"The Waters of the Olympic Park\" (designed by California-based company WET), a choreographed fountain which served as the backdrop in the medals awards and the opening and closing ceremonies of the event.[20][21] The new venues include:[22]\n\n\n\n* Fisht Olympic Stadium – ceremonies (opening/closing) 40,000 spectators\n* Bolshoy Ice Dome – ice hockey (final), 12,000 spectators\n* Shayba Arena – ice hockey, 7,000 spectators\n* Adler Arena Skating Center – speed skating, 8,000 spectators\n* Iceberg Skating Palace – figure skating, short track speed skating, 12,000 spectators\n* Ice Cube Curling Center – curling, 3,000 spectators\n* Main Olympic village\n* International broadcasting centre and main press room\n\n\n![](image)\nA sketch of the layout of Sochi Olympic Park.\n\n### Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai\n\n![](image)Chairlift in Krasnaya Polyana\n* Laura Biathlon & Ski Complex – biathlon, cross-country skiing\n* Rosa Khutor Extreme Park – freestyle skiing and snowboarding\n* Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort – alpine skiing\n* Sliding Center Sanki – bobsleigh, luge and skeleton\n* RusSki Gorki Jumping Center – ski jumping and Nordic combined (both ski jumping and cross-country skiing on a 2 km route around the arena)\n* Roza Khutor plateau Olympic Village\n\n\n![](image)\n2014 Winter Olympics Mountain Cluster Venues (interactive map)\n\n### Post-Olympic usage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fisht Olympic Stadium under re-construction in 2015.\nA street circuit known as the Sochi Autodrom was constructed in and around Olympic Park. Its primary use is to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix, which held its inaugural edition in October 2014.[23][24]\n\n\nIn January 2015, work began on adapting Fisht Olympic Stadium into an open-air football stadium to host matches during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[25][26]\n\n\nA new ice hockey team in the Kontinental Hockey League, HC Sochi Leopards, now plays in Bolshoy Arena.\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics marketing\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vladimir Putin with George W. Bush and Laura Bush examining the models of the Olympic facilities for Sochi, April 2008\n![](image)100 Russian ruble banknote issued in 2013 by the Central Bank of Russia\nThe Olympic infrastructure was constructed according to a Federal Target Program (FTP). In June 2009, the Games' organizers reported they were one year ahead in building the main Olympic facilities as compared to recent Olympic Games.[27] In November 2011, IOC President Jacques Rogge was in Sochi and concluded that the city had made significant progress since he last visited eighteen months earlier.[28]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications in Russia\n\nAccording to the FTP, US$580 million would be spent on construction and modernization of telecommunications in the region. Avaya was named by the Sochi Organizing Committee as the official supplier of telecommunications equipment. Avaya provided the data network equipment, including switches, routers, security, telephones and contact-center systems. It provided engineers and technicians to design and test the systems, and worked with other technology partners to provide athletes, dignitaries and fans information about the Games.[29][30]\n\n\nThe 2014 Olympics is the first \"fabric-enabled\" Games using Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology.[31] The network is capable of handling up to 54 Tbit/s of traffic.[32]\n\n\nInfrastructure built for the games included:\n\n\n\n* A network of TETRA mobile radio communications for 100 user groups (with capacity of 10,000 subscribers);\n* 712 km (442 mi) of fiber-optic cables along the Anapa-Dzhubga-Sochi highways and Dzhubga–Krasnodar branch;\n* Digital broadcasting infrastructure, including radio and television broadcasting stations (building and communications towers) with coverage from Grushevaya Polyana (*Pear Glade*) to Sochi and Anapa cities. The project also included construction of infocommunications centre for broadcasting abroad via three HDTV satellites.\n\n\nDuring the Games, the core networks of Rostelecom and Transtelekom were used.[33]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the newest equipment for the television coverage of the Games arrived in the port of Adler. Prepared specifically for the Games, a team of regional specialists and the latest technology provide a qualitatively new level of television production in the region.[34]\n\n\nThe fiber-optic channel links Sochi between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana. The 46-kilometre-long (29 mi) channel enables videoconferencing and news reporting from the Olympics.[35]\n\n\nIn November 2013, it was reported that the fiber-optic cable that was built by the Federal Communications Agency, Rossvyaz, had no operator. With Rostelecom and Megafon both refusing to operate it, the line was transferred to the ownership of the state enterprise Center for Monitoring & Development of Infocommunication Technologies (Russian: Центр МИР ИТ).[36]\n\n\nRussian mobile phone operator Megafon expanded and improved Sochi's telecom infrastructure with over 700 new 2G/3G/4G cell towers. Sochi was the first Games to offer 4G connectivity at a speed of 10 MB/sec.\n\n\nIn January 2014, Rostelecom reported that it had connected the Olympic media center in Sochi to the Internet and organized channels of communication with the main media center of the Olympic Games in the coastal cluster and press center in Moscow. The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Power infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Night view of Sochi during the Olympics, taken by Expedition 38 members from the International Space Station\nA five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the Russian Ministry of Regional Development, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.[39]\n\n\nAccording to the strategy, the capacity of the regional energy network would increase by two and a half times by 2014, guaranteeing a stable power supply during and after the Games.\n\n\nThe power demand of Sochi at the end of May 2009 was 424 MW. The power demand of the Olympic infrastructure was expected to be about 340 MW.\n\n\n\n* Poselkovaya electrical substation became operational in early 2009.\n* Sochi thermal power station reconstructed (expected power output was 160 MW)\n* Laura and Rosa Khutor electrical substations were completed in November 2010\n* Mzymta electrical substation was completed in March 2011\n* Krasnopolyanskaya hydroelectric power station was completed in 2010\n* Adler CHP station design and construction was completed in 2012. Expected power output was 360 MW[40]\n* Bytkha substation, under construction[*when?*] with two transformers 25 MW each, includes dependable microprocessor-based protection\n\n\nEarlier plans also include building combined cycle (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of Tuapse and Novorossiysk and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the Black Sea.[41]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in Russia\n\nThe transport infrastructure prepared to support the Olympics includes many roads, tunnels, bridges, interchanges, railroads and stations in and around Sochi. Among others, 8 flyovers, 102 bridges, tens of tunnels and a bypass route for heavy trucks – 367 km (228 mi) of roads were paved.[42]\n\n\nThe Sochi Light Metro is located between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana connecting the Olympic Park, Sochi International Airport, and the venues in Krasnaya Polyana.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Park railway station\nThe existing 102 km (63-mile), Tuapse-to-Adler railroad was renovated to provide double track throughout, increasing capacity and enabling a reliable regional service to be provided and extending to the airport. In December 2009, Russian Railways ordered 38 Siemens Mobility Desiro trains for delivery in 2013 for use during the Olympics, with an option for a further 16 partly built in Russia.[44]\n\n\nAt Sochi International Airport, a new terminal was built along a 3.5 km (2.2-mile) runway extension, overlapping the Mzymta River.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sochi seaport\nAt the Port of Sochi, a new offshore terminal 1.5 km (0.93 mi) from the shore allows docking for cruise ships with capacities of 3,000 passengers.[46] The cargo terminal of the seaport would be moved from the centre of Sochi.\n\n\nRoadways were detoured, some going around the construction site and others being cut off.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)A \"Lastochka\" (Siemens Desiro) train, which serves the Tuapse–Sochi route\nIn May 2009, Russian Railways started the construction of tunnel complex No. 1 (the final total is six) on the combined road (automobile and railway) from Adler to Alpica Service Mountain Resort in the Krasnaya Polyana region. The tunnel complex No. 1 is located near Akhshtyr in Adlersky City District, and includes:[48]\n\n\n\n* Escape tunnel, 2.25 kilometres (1.40 mi), completed in 2010\n* Road tunnel, 2,153 metres (7,064 ft), completed in 2013\n* One-track railway tunnel, 2,473 metres (8,114 ft), completed in 2013\n\n\nRussian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin stated the road construction costed more than 200 billion rubles.[49]\n\n\nIn addition, Sochi's railway stations were renovated. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta, Khosta, Lazarevskaya, and Loo railway stations. In Adler, a new railway station was built while the original building was preserved, and in the Olympic park cluster, a new station was built from scratch, the Olympic Park railway station. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\n\n### Other infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sochi at night from space[50]\nFunds were spent on the construction of hotels for 10,300 guests.[51] The first of the Olympic hotels, Zvezdny (*Stellar*), was rebuilt anew.[52] Significant funds were spent on the construction of an advanced sewage treatment system in Sochi, designed by Olimpstroy. The system meets BREF standards and employs top available technologies for environment protection, including tertiary treatment with microfiltration.[53]\n\n\nSix post offices were opened at competition venues, two of them in the main media centre in Olympic Park and in the mountain village of Estosadok. In addition to standard services, customers had access to unique services including two new products, Fotomarka and Retropismo. Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylized sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one's own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and wax seal affixing. All the new sites and post offices in Sochi were opened during the Olympics until late night 7 days a week, and employees were trained to speak English.[54]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics torch relay\nTorch relay in Moscow\nOn 29 September 2013, the Olympic torch was lit in Ancient Olympia, beginning a seven-day journey across Greece and on to Russia, then the torch relay started at Moscow on 7 October 2013 before passing 83 Russian cities and arriving at Sochi on the day of the opening ceremony, 7 February 2014.[55] It is the longest torch relay in Olympic history, a 60,000-kilometre (40,000 mi) route that passes through all regions of the country, from Kaliningrad in the west to Chukotka in the east.\n\n\nThe Olympic torch reached the North Pole for first time via a nuclear-powered icebreaker *(50 Let Pobedy)*. The torch was also passed for the first time in space, though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed livery including the Games' emblem. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky waved the torch on a spacewalk outside the ISS. The torch returned to Earth five days later on board Soyuz TMA-09M.[56][57] The torch also reached Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and Siberia's Lake Baikal.[58]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony and 2014 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks over Fisht Olympic Stadium following the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron.\n![](image)The Olympic Rings at Sochi Olympic Park\nThe opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium, an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak, who exited the stadium to jointly light the Olympic cauldron located near the center of Olympic Park.[59][60][61][62]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record 88 nations qualified to compete,[63] which beat the previous record of 82 set at the previous Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Seven nations made their Winter Olympics debut: Dominica, Malta, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe.[64] The Winter debut of Malta meant that for the first time ever, all of the current members of the European Olympic Committees participated at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\nKristina Krone qualified to compete in her second consecutive games for Puerto Rico, but the island's Olympic Committee once again chose not to send her to compete.[65] Similarly, South Africa decided not to send alpine skier Sive Speelman to Sochi.[66] Algeria also did not enter its only qualified athlete, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi.[67]\n\n\nIndia's athletes originally competed as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony, as India was originally suspended in December 2012 over the election process of the Indian Olympic Association.[68] On 11 February, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward.[69] Although Shiva Keshavan competed as an Independent athlete and is recorded as such, he was permitted to walk under the flag of India at the Closing Ceremony.\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the Winter Olympics\nYellow circle is host city (Sochi)\n\n![](image)Number of participating

sports. A total of twelve new events were contested, making it the largest Winter Olympics to date.[83]\n\n\n\n1. **Biathlon**\n\t* ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n2. **Bobsleigh**\n\t* ![](image) Bobsleigh (3) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n3. **Curling**\n\t* ![](image) Curling (2) (details)\n4. **Ice hockey**\n\t* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n5. **Luge**\n\t* ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n6. **Skating**\n\t* ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Short track speed skating (8) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Speed skating (12) (details)\n7. **Skiing**\n\t* ![](image) Alpine skiing (10) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Freestyle skiing (10) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Ski jumping (4) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Snowboarding (10) (details)\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.*\n\n\n\n#### New events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Postage stamps of Transnistria, Sochi Olympic Games (2014)\nOn 6 April 2011, the IOC accepted a number of events that were submitted by their respective sports federations to be considered for inclusion into the official program of these Olympic Games.[84]\nThe events included a Figure skating team event, Women's ski jumping, Mixed relay biathlon, Ski half-pipe, and Team relay luge.\n\n\nOn 4 July 2011, the IOC announced that three events would be added to the program.[85] These events, which were officially declared by Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge on 4 July 2011, were: Ski slopestyle, Snowboard slopestyle, Snowboard parallel special slalom.[86]\n\n\nTeam alpine skiing was also presented as a candidate for inclusion in the Olympic program but the Executive board of the IOC rejected this proposal. The International Ski Federation persisted with the nomination and this was considered.[87] There were reports of bandy possibly being added to the sports program,[88][89][90] but the IOC rejected this request. Subsequently, the international governing body, Federation of International Bandy, decided that Irkutsk and Shelekhov in Russia would host the 2014 Bandy World Championship just before the Olympics.\n\n\nOn 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include ski mountaineering,[91] ski-orienteering,[92] or winter triathlon[93] in the review process of the program.[93]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 23 February 2014 between 20:14 MSK (UTC+4) and 22:25 MSK (UTC+4) at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.[94]\nThe ceremony was dedicated to Russian culture featuring world-renowned Russian stars like conductor and violinist Yuri Bashmet, conductor Valery Gergiev, pianist Denis Matsuev, singer Hibla Gerzmava and violinist Tatiana Samouil. These artists were joined by performers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theaters.\n\n\n\n## Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2014 Winter Olympics\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics medal winners\n\nSochi's medal design was unveiled in May 2013. The design is intended to resemble Sochi's landscape, with a semi-translucent section containing a \"patchwork quilt\" of diamonds representing mountains; the diamonds themselves contain designs that reflect Russia's regions.[95] Those who won gold medals on 15 February received special medals with fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor, marking the one-year anniversary of the event where pieces of the cosmic body fell into the Chebarkul Lake in the Ural Mountains in central Russia.[96]\n\n\n\n### Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics medal table\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below.

To enter controlled areas, visitors were required to pass through security checkpoints with X-ray machines, metal detectors and explosive material scanners.[101] Several areas were designated as \"forbidden\", including Sochi National Park and the border with Abkhazia.[100][102] An unmanned aerial vehicle squadron, along with S-400 and Pantsir-S1 air defense rockets were used to protect Olympic airspace. Four gunboats were also deployed on the Black Sea to protect the coastline.[103]\n\n\nA number of security organizations and forces began stationing in and around Sochi in January 2014; Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) was stationed in Sochi for the Games beginning on 7 January 2014.[104][105] A group of 10,000 Internal Troops of the Ministry of Interior also provided security services during the Games.[106] In mid-January, 1,500 Siberian Regional Command troops were stationed in a military town near Krasnaya Polyana.[107] A group of 400 Cossacks in traditional uniforms were also present to accompany police patrols.[108][109] The 58th Army unit of the Russian Armed Forces were defending the Georgia–Russia border.[110] The United States also supplied Navy ships and other assets for security purposes.[111]\n\n\nAll communication and Internet traffic by Sochi residents was captured and filtered through deep packet inspection systems at all mobile networks using the SORM system.[112][113]\n\n\nFormer professional speed skater and current deputy of the Russian State Duma Svetlana Zhurova has stated that the 2014 Sochi Olympics were Vladimir Putin's personal project to showcase Russia to the world.[114]\n\n\n\n### Incidents and threats[edit]\n\n\nOrganizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged \"on the bones of many, many Muslims killed ... and buried on our lands extending to the Red Sea\".[115]\n\n\nThreats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or \"blow up\" athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters \"[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public\", the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games.[110][116][117]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nIn most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters: Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.[118]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.[119]\n\n\nIn Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and Réseau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group's TVA Sports.[120][121][122][123]\n\n\nIn Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.[124][125][126]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSeveral broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing. Olympic sponsor Panasonic filmed the opening ceremony in 4K.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia's policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government's denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors.[131][132][133][134][135] Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history, with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials,[136] and Allison Stewart of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms.[137] It was reported that Putin's annexation of Crimea may have been intended to distract local Russians from corruption stories related to the Games.[138][139]\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. broadcaster NBC largely avoided broadcasting material critical of Russia, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some commentators.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the closing ceremony, commentators evaluated the Games to have been successful overall.[141][142]\n\n\n\n### Circassian genocide[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Circassians in Turkey commemorate the Circassian genocide in Taksim, Istanbul\nSome Circassian organizations objected to the Games being held on land their ancestors held until 1864,[143][144] when most of them were vanquished at the end of the Russian-Circassian War (1763–1864), in the Circassian genocide[145][146] The use of Krasnaya Polyana (\"Red Hill\" or \"Red Glade\") as an event site was considered insensitive, as it was named for a group of Circassians who were defeated in a bloody battle with Russians while attempting to return home over it in 1864.[147][148] Some Circassian groups demanded that the Games be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for their actions.[149] Other groups did not outright object to the Games, but suggested that symbols of Circassian history and culture be incorporated into the Games, as Australia, the United States and Canada did for their indigenous cultures in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.[150]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, and Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nFollowing the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD,[151] and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by *The New York Times*—which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.[152][153] Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.[152][153][154][155]\n\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commissioned an independent report by Richard McLaren, which corroborated claims that Russian authorities had been discreetly swapping out urine samples that tested positive for performance-enhancing substances. The report concluded that the program had been operating from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\", and had covered up 643 positive samples across Olympic and non-Olympic sports.[156][157][158] As a result, WADA considered the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[159]\n\n\nRussia was not banned from the 2016 Olympics by the IOC, a decision that was widely criticized by both athletes[160][161][162] and writers;[163][164][165] the IOC only required Russia's athletes to be cleared by an internal panel and their respective sports federations.[166] The IAAF had suspended Russia from international track and field events due to the scandal, but did allow Darya Klishina to participate in the Olympics because she was confirmed not to be a part of a doping program, despite claims that surfaced in her appeal that a sample of Klishina's that had been collected on 26 February 2014 had yielded an illegal testosterone/epitestosterone ratio of 8.5 had been subject\nto a \"SAVE\" order by the Ministry of Sport on 3 March 2014.[167][168][169] The International Paralympic Committee suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee and banned the team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics.[170]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, thus banning it from sending athletes under the Russian flag to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cleared Russian athletes were allowed to participate as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR).[5][6] Two of them – curler Alexander Krushelnitskiy, who won a bronze medal, and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva – failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nThe IOC's Oswald Commission disqualified and banned 43 Russian athletes, and stripped thirteen medals they earned in Sochi.[171] In December 2017, 42 of the 43 punished athletes appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On 1 February 2018, the CAS found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence and cleared 28 athletes from IOC sanctions. In total, Russian athletes won back 9 of the 13 medals collected. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics.[172] The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC found it important to note that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent” and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision.[173][174] Later that month, the Russian Olympic Committee was reinstated by the IOC, despite failed doping tests during the 2018 Olympics,[175] and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was re-certified in September, despite the Russian officials not accepting the McLaren report.[176]\n\n\n\n### Subsequent events[edit]\n\n\nJust 4 days after the closing of the Games, Russian troops entered Ukrainian Crimea and started the formal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Russia formally incorporated Crimea into its territory on 14th March 2014.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n* ![flag](image)Russia portal\n* ![icon](image)2010s portal\n\n\n* 2014 Winter Paralympics\n* 2014 Summer Youth Olympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Sochi 2014 Facts & figures\" (PDF).

The first event, the group stage in women's football, began on 25 July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, followed by the opening ceremony on 27 July.[3][4] There were 10,518 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) who participated in the 2012 Olympics.[5]\n\n\nFollowing a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and the then-London mayor Ken Livingstone, London was selected as the host city at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore on 6 July 2005, defeating bids from Moscow, New York City, Madrid, and Paris.[6] London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times,[7][b] having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and 1948.[8][9] Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability.[10] The main focus was a new 200-hectare (490-acre) Olympic Park, constructed on a former industrial site in Stratford, East London.[11] The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid.[12]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (104). China finished second with a total of 91 medals (38 gold) and Great Britain came third with 65 medals overall (29 gold). Michael Phelps of the United States became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, winning his 22nd medal.[13] Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time, meaning that every currently eligible country has now sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games.[14] Women's boxing was included for the first time, and the 2012 Games became the first at which every sport had female competitors.[15][16][17]\n\n\nThe Games received considerable praise for their organisation, with the volunteers, the British military and public enthusiasm commended particularly highly.[18][19][20] The Games were described as \"happy and glorious\".[21] The opening ceremony, directed by Academy Award winner Danny Boyle, received widespread acclaim.[22][23] These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Belgian Jacques Rogge, who was succeeded by German Thomas Bach the next year.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nLondon was chosen over Birmingham to represent Great Britain's bid by the British Olympic Association.\n\n\nBy 15 July 2003—the deadline for interested cities to submit bids to the International Olympic Committee (IOC)—nine cities had submitted bids to host the 2012 Summer Olympics: Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig, London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro.[24] On 18 May 2004, as a result of a scored technical evaluation, the IOC reduced the number of cities to five: London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris.[25] All five submitted their candidate files by 19 November 2004 and were visited by the IOC inspection team during February and March 2005. The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits, and a report that a key member of the bid team, Guy Drut, would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.[26]\n\n\nThroughout the process, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as this was its third bid in recent years. London was initially seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin.[27] Its position began to improve after the appointment of Lord Coe as the new chair of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) on 19 May 2004.[28] In late August 2004, reports predicted a tie between London and Paris.[29]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2005, the IOC released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations.[30] On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, \"I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less.\"[31]\n\n\nOn 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore. Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two contenders were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes to 50.[32]\n\n\nThe celebrations in London were short-lived, being overshadowed by bombings on London's transport system less than 24 hours after the announcement.[33]\n\n\n\n\n\n**2012 host city election – ballot results**\n| City\n | NOC\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** |\n| London | ![](image) Great Britain | **22** | 27 | **39** | **54** |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 21 | 25 | 33 | 50\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | 20 | **32** | 31 | —\n |\n| New York City | ![](image) United States | 19 | 17 | — | —\n |\n| Moscow | ![](image) Russia | 15 | — | — | —\n |\n|  | **Total ballots** | 97\n | 101\n | 103\n | 104\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympic development\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) was created to oversee the staging of the Games, and held its first board meeting on 3 October 2005.[34] The committee, chaired by Lord Coe, was in charge of implementing and staging the Games, while the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), established in April 2006, was in charge of construction of the venues and infrastructure.[34][35]\n\n\nThe Government Olympic Executive (GOE), a unit within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), was the lead government body for coordinating the London 2012 Olympics. It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme management, and the London 2012 Olympic Legacy before and after the Games that would benefit London and the wider United Kingdom. The organisation was also responsible for the supervision of the £9.3 billion of public sector funding.[36]\n\n\nIn August 2011, security concerns arose surrounding the hosting of the Olympic Games in London, following the 2011 England riots.[37] Some countries expressed safety concerns,[38] despite the IOC's assurance that the riots would not affect the Games.[39] The IOC's Coordination Commission for the 2012 Games completed its tenth and final visit to London in March 2012. Its members concluded that \"London is ready to host the world this summer\".[40]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\nThe 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade. After the Games, some of the new facilities would be reused in their Olympic form, while others will be resized or relocated.[41]\n\n\nThe majority of venues were divided into three zones within Greater London: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. In addition there were a few venues that, by necessity, were outside the boundaries of Greater London, such as the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy some 125 mi (201 km) southwest of London, which hosted the sailing events. The football tournament was staged at several grounds around the UK.[42] Work began on the Park in December 2006, when a sports hall in Eton Manor was pulled down.[43] The athletes' village in Portland was completed in September 2011.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)London Olympic Stadium\nIn November 2004, the 200-hectare (500-acre) Olympic Park plans were revealed.[45] The plans for the site were approved in September 2004 by Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Waltham Forest.[46] The redevelopment of the area to build the Olympic Park required compulsory purchase orders of property. The London Development Agency was in dispute with London and Continental Railways about the orders in November 2005. By May 2006, 86% of the land had been bought as businesses fought eviction.[47] Residents who opposed the eviction tried to find ways to stop it by setting up campaigns, but they had to leave as 94% of land was bought and the other 6% bought as a £9 billion regeneration project started.[48]\n\n\nThere were some issues with the original venues not being challenging enough or being financially unviable. Both the Olympic road races and the mountain bike event were initially considered to be too easy, so they were eventually scheduled on new locations.[49][50] The Olympic marathon course, which was set to finish in the Olympic stadium, was moved to The Mall, since closing Tower Bridge was deemed to cause traffic problems in central London.[51] North Greenwich Arena 2 was scrapped in a cost-cutting exercise, Wembley Arena being used for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics events instead.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of *London Prepares*.[56] Team GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Designed by architects Gebler Tooth on the top floor of an office building in Westfield Stratford City, it combined the team HQ, athletes' \"Friends and Family\" lounge, Press Centre, and VIP lounge.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Olympic Javelin high-speed service ran between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet, via Stratford.\nIOC's initial evaluation felt that, if transport improvements were delivered in time for the Games, London would cope.[57] Transport for London (TfL) carried out numerous improvements in preparation for 2012, including the expansion of the London Overground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the introduction of a new \"Javelin\" high-speed rail service.[58] According to Network Rail, an additional 4,000 train services operated during the Games, and train operators ran longer trains during the day.[59] During the Games, Stratford International station was not served by any international services (just as it had not been before the Games),[60] westbound trains did not stop at Hackney Wick railway station,[61] and Pudding Mill Lane DLR station closed entirely during the Games.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Emirates Air Line crosses the River Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks.\nTfL also built a £25 million cable car across the River Thames, called the Emirates Air Line, to link 2012 Olympics venues.[63] It was inaugurated in June 2012 and crosses the Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks, carrying up to 2,500 passengers an hour, cutting journey times between the O2 arena and the ExCeL exhibition centre and providing a crossing every 30 seconds.[64]\n\n\nThe plan was to have 80% of athletes travel less than 20 minutes to their event[65] and 93% of them within 30 minutes of their event.[66] The Olympic Park would be served by ten separate railway lines with a combined capacity of 240,000 passengers per hour.[67] In addition, LOCOG planned for 90% of the venues to be served by three or more types of public transport.[66] Two park-and-ride sites off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars were 25 minutes away from the Olympic Park. Another park-and-ride site was planned in Ebbsfleet with a capacity for 9,000 cars where spectators could board a 10-minute shuttle train service.[66] To get spectators to Eton Dorney, four park-and-ride schemes were set up.[68] These Park and Ride services were operated by First Games Transport.[69]\n\n\nTfL defined a network of roads leading between venues as the Olympic Route Network; roads connecting all of the Olympic venues located within London. Many of these roads also contained special \"Olympic lanes\" marked with the Olympic rings—reserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of £130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes.[70][71][72] Concerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the sailing events at Portland had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer.[73] However, a £77 million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.[74][75] Some £16 million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.[76]\n\n\nTfL created a promotional campaign and website, *Get Ahead of the Games*, to help provide information related to transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. Through the campaign, TfL also encouraged the use of cycling as a mode of transport.[77] A temporary terminal was created at Heathrow Airport to be used by 10,100 departing athletes after the Games. Up to 35% more bags than normal were expected on 13 August, which was predicted to be the busiest day in the airport's history, according to Nick Cole, head of Olympic and Paralympic planning at Heathrow.\n\n\n\n### Cost and financing[edit]\n\n\nA study from Oxford University found that the sports-related costs of London 2012 amounted to US$15 billion, compared with $4.6 billion for Rio 2016, $40–44 billion for Beijing 2008, and $51 billion for Sochi 2014 (the most expensive Olympics in history). London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion. Cost per athlete was $1.4 million.[78] This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often equal or exceed the sports-related costs.\n\n\nThe costs of staging the Games were separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park. While the Games were privately funded, the venues and infrastructure were largely financed using public money.\n\n\nAccording to *The Wall Street Journal*, the original budget for the Games was increased to about £9.3 billion (US$15.28 billion) in 2007.[79] The revised figures were announced to the House of Commons on 15 March 2007 by Tessa Jowell. Along with East End regeneration costs, the breakdown was:\n\n\n\n* Building the venues and infrastructure – £5.3 billion\n* Elite sport and Paralympic funding – £400 million\n* Security and policing – £600 million\n* Regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley – £1.7 billion\n* Contingency fund – £2.7 billion\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers known as Games Makers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games.[80] A target of 70,000 volunteers was set as early as 2004.[81] When recruitment took place in 2010, more than 240,000 applications were received.[82] Sebastian Coe said in February 2012, \"Our Games Makers will contribute a total of around eight million volunteer hours during the Games and the Games simply wouldn't happen without them\".[83] The volunteers wore clothing that included purple and red polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, grey socks and grey-and-white trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges that were also worn by officials, athletes, family members and media, which gained them access to specific venues and buildings around the site.\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nOrganisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games,[84] and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games.[84] LOCOG aimed to raise £375–£400 million in ticket sales. There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling,[85] although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed.[86] Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold.[87] Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence. European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country.[88]\n\n\nIn Great Britain, ticket prices ranged from £20 for many events to £2,012 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. Some free tickets were given to military personnel as part of the Tickets For Troops scheme,[89] as well as to survivors and families of those who died during 7 July 2005 London bombings.[90] Initially, people were able to apply for tickets via a website from 15 March until 26 April 2011. There was a huge demand for tickets, with a demand of more than three times the number of tickets available.[91][92] On 11 May 2012 a round of nearly one million \"second chance\" tickets went on sale over a 10-day period between 23 June and 3 July 2011.[93] About 1.7 million tickets were available for football and 600,000 for other sports, including archery, field hockey, football, judo, boxing and volleyball. Ten sports had sold out by 8 am of the first day.[94]\n\n\n\n### Countdown[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Countdown Clock in Trafalgar Square\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, the Olympic Flag was formally handed over from the Mayor of Beijing to the Mayor of London. This was followed by a section highlighting London,[95] One month later, the Olympic and Paralympic flags were raised outside the London City Hall.[96]\n\n\nA countdown clock in Trafalgar Square was unveiled, 500 days before the Games.[97][98] It was a two-sided clock with the Paralympic countdown on the other side. The countdown to the start of the Olympics began with a ceremony for the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece.[99]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Security for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Controversies surrounding G4S\n\nThe police led the security operation (named **Operation Olympics** by the Ministry of Defence), with 10,000 officers available, supported by 13,500 members of the British Armed Forces. Naval and air assets were deployed as part of the security operation, including ships situated in the Thames, Typhoon fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles;[100] it was the biggest security operation Britain had faced in decades. The cost of security increased from £282 million to £553 million, and the figure of 13,500 armed forces personnel was greater than the number deployed at the time in Afghanistan.[101] The Metropolitan Police and the Royal Marines carried out security exercises in preparation for the Olympics on 19 January 2012, with 50 marine police officers in rigid inflatables and fast response boats, joined by up to 100 military personnel and a Royal Navy Lynx helicopter.[102]\n\n\nThe Ministry of Defence distributed leaflets to residents of the Lexington building in Bow, announcing that a missile system was to be stationed on top of the water tower.[103][104] This caused concern to some residents.[103][104] The Ministry said it probably would use Starstreak missiles and that site evaluations had taken place, but that no final decision had taken place.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front of the Silver Medal won by the USA.\nApproximately 4,700[105] Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant.[106] They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics).[107] 99% of the gold, silver and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S.[108] The remaining 1% came from a Mongolian mine.[109] Each medal weighs 375–400 g (13.2–14.1 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 7 mm (0.28 in) thick, with the sport and discipline engraved on the rim.[110] The obverse, as is traditional, features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, stepping from the Panathinaiko Stadium that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, with Parthenon in the background; the reverse features the Games logo, the River Thames and a series of lines representing \"the energy of athletes and a sense of pulling together\".[111] The medals were transferred to the Tower of London vaults on 2 July 2012 for storage.[110]\n\n\nEach gold medal is 92.5 percent silver and 1.34 percent gold, with the remainder copper. The silver medal is 92.5 percent silver, with the remainder copper. The bronze medal is made up of 97 percent copper, 2.5 percent zinc, and 0.5 per cent tin.[112] The value of the materials in the gold medal was about £410 (US$644), the silver about £210 (US$330), and the bronze about £3 (US$4.71) as of 30 July 2012.[113]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe Olympics torch relay ran from 19 May to 27 July 2012, before the Games. Plans for the relay were developed in 2010–11, with the torch-bearer selection process announced on 18 May 2011.[114] The torch was designed by Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby.\n\n\nOn 18 May 2012 the Olympic flame arrived at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall from Greece[115] on flight BA2012, operated by a British Airways Airbus A319 named \"Firefly\". The relay lasted 70 days, with 66 evening celebrations and six island visits, and involved some 8,000 people carrying the torch about 8,000 mi (12,875 km), starting from Land's End in Cornwall.[116] The torch had three days outside the United Kingdom when it visited the Isle of Man on 2 June, Dublin in Ireland, on 6 June,[117] and both Guernsey and Jersey on 15 July.\n\n\nThe relay focused on National Heritage Sites, locations with sporting significance, key sporting events, schools registered with the Get Set School Network, green spaces and biodiversity, Live Sites (city locations with large screens), and festivals and other events.[118] Dumfries and Galloway was the only Region in the whole of the United Kingdom that had the Olympic Torch pass through it twice. A group of young athletes, nominated by retired Olympic athletes, ran the torch around the stadium. These torchbearers were Callum Airlie, Jordan Duckitt, Desiree Henry, Katie Kirk, Cameron MacRitchie, Aidan Reynolds, and Adelle Tracey. Together the torchbearers each lit a petal that spread the fire to the 204 petals of the cauldron, representing the countries that participated in the Games.[119] The cauldron was designed by Thomas Heatherwick.\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nThe Olympic Park was planned to incorporate 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, with a total of 525 bird boxes and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process.[120] Renewable energy also featured at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, only 9% of it was achieved.[121] Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames. These plans were scrapped for safety reasons.[122] The focus subsequently moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste. Where it could not be reused or recycled, food packaging for use at the Olympics—including fast-food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons—was made from compostable materials like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics. After use, many of these materials were suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.[123]\n\n\nPost-Games, buildings like the Water Polo Arena were relocated elsewhere. Building parts like roofing covers and membranes of different temporary venues were recycled via VinyLoop. This allowed organisers to meet the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection.\n\n\nLondon 2012 inaugurated Olympic Games guidelines that included the recycling of PVC, which was used for temporary buildings such as the Basketball Arena and for the temporary parts of permanent venues such as the Olympic Stadium.[124] In the Water Polo Arena, PVC roofing was made from recycled cushions to provide insulation.[125] Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy was fulfilled; the policy states:[126]\n\n\n\nWhere London 2012 procures PVC for temporary usage or where permanent usage is not assured, London 2012 is required to ensure that there is a take-back scheme that offers a closed-loop reuse system or mechanical recycling system for post-consumer waste.\nAccording to Kirsten Henson, Materials Manager for the London 2012 Olympic Park: \"The majority of temporary facilities created for the Olympic Games including the Aquatic centre temporary stands, basketball arena, Water Polo Arena, and the shooting facilities at the Royal Artillery Barracks, are essentially big tents. Basically, PVC stretched over lightweight steel frame. This design solution makes them efficient to install, reduces the need for any significant foundations and are, of course, reusable. We were challenged by the public around the use of PVC; but we considered it to be the right material for certain functions. We therefore challenged the PVC supply chain to have certain environmental performance criteria in place, including a take back and recycle scheme.\"[127]\n\n\n\n### Cultural Olympiad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Cultural Olympiad\n\n![](image)Tower Bridge was illuminated with the Olympic Rings in the week leading up to the opening ceremony.\nThe Olympic Charter, the set of rules and guidelines for the organization of the Olympic Games and for governing the Olympic Movement, states that\n\n\n\n\n> LOCOG shall organise a programme of cultural events which must cover at least the entire period during which the Olympic Village is open.[128]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Cultural Olympiad comprised many programmes, with more than 500 events spread over four years across the whole of the United Kingdom, and culminating in the London 2012 Festival.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks at the opening ceremony\nTitled \"The Isles of Wonder\", the opening ceremony began at 21:00 British Summer Time (UTC+1) on 27 July in the Olympic Stadium.[131] Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle was artistic director and Rick Smith of Underworld was musical director.[132] The opening ceremony was immediately seen as a tremendous success, widely praised as a \"masterpiece\" and \"a love letter to Britain\".[133][134] The principal sections of the artistic display represented Britain's Industrial Revolution, National Health Service, literary heritage, popular music and culture, and were noted for their vibrant storytelling and use of music.\n\n\nThe Games were officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[135] This was the second Olympic Games opened personally by the Queen, the first being in 1976 in Montreal, Canada. The ceremony featured a short comic film starring Daniel Craig as secret agent James Bond and the Queen as herself.[136] There was also a musical comedy item starring Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean playing along with the London Symphony Orchestra.[137] These were widely ascribed to Britain's sense of humour.[138]\n\n\nLive musical performers included Frank Turner, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Mike Oldfield, Dizzee Rascal, Arctic Monkeys, and Sir Paul McCartney who performed \"Hey Jude\" as the closing act.[139][140] Broadcast live on BBC One, the ceremony attracted a peak viewing audience of over 27 million in the UK.[141]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 12 August. It featured a flashback fiesta to British music with The Who closing the performance. The ceremony also included a handover of the Olympic flag by Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the host city of the 2016 Summer Olympics.[142] In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"happy and glorious\".[21]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Number of participating

acquired at least one medal: gold, silver or bronze)[143] surpassing the 1948 Summer Olympics in London and the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester as the largest multi-sport event ever to be held in the United Kingdom.[144]\n\n\nThree athletes from the Netherlands Antilles, which whose territory was dissolved in 2010 and lost its recognition during 123rd IOC session held during July 2011, and one athlete from South Sudan, which their NOC was recognized in 2015, participated as two independent athletes teams under the Olympic flag.[145]\n\n\n\n| Participating National Olympic Committees

countries and continents had a \"national house\". These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout London.[147][148]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Nation | Location | Name\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| African nations | Kensington Gardens |\n| Austria | Trinity House |\n| Belgium | Inner Temple |\n| Brazil | Somerset House | Casa Brasil\n |\n| Canada | Canada House |\n| China | The Waldorf Hilton |\n| Croatia | Pelham Hotel, South Kensington |\n| Czech Republic | Business Design Centre, Islington |\n| Denmark | St Katherine Docks |\n| France | Old Billingsgate | Club France\n |\n| Georgia | Chelsea College of Art and Design (45 Millbank)\n |\n| Germany | Museum of London Docklands | Deutsches Haus\n |\n| Great Britain | Westfield Stratford City |\n| Ireland | The Big Chill House, Kings Cross |\n| Italy | Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre | Casa Italia\n |\n| Japan | Royal Aeronautical Society |\n| Jamaica | The O2 |\n| Kenya | East Thames Community Centre, Stratford |\n| Korea | Royal Thames Yacht Club |\n| Monaco | Haymarket |\n| Netherlands | Alexandra Palace | Holland Heineken House |\n| New Zealand | Granary Square, Kings Cross | Kiwi House\n |\n| Nigeria | Theatre Royal Stratford East |\n| Poland | Polish Social and Cultural Centre |\n| Qatar | Institution of Engineering and Technology, Savoy Place |\n| Romania | 30 Pavilion Road, Knightsbridge |\n| Russia | Perks Field, Kensington Palace |\n| Slovakia | Institute of Directors |\n| South Africa | Queen Elizabeth Hall |\n| South Pacific | St Katharine Docks |\n| Switzerland | Glazier's Hall |\n| Trinidad & Tobago | Tricycle Theatre |\n| USA | Royal College of Art |\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2012 Summer Olympics featured 26 different sports encompassing 39 disciplines and 302 events. In the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics Sports Programme\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (34)\n\t+ ![](image) Synchronized swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (4)\n* ![](image) Athletics (47)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* ![](image) Basketball (2)\n* ![](image) Boxing (13)\n | * ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n* ![](image) Cycling (competitors)\n\t+ BMX (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road (4)\n\t+ Track (10)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n | * ![](image) Fencing (10)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n* ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (14)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (4)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (11)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (7)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\nWomen's boxing was included in the programme for the first time, and 36 women competed in three weight classes. There was a special dispensation for the shooting events, which would otherwise have been illegal under UK gun law.[149][150] In tennis, mixed doubles returned to the Olympic programme for the first time since 1924.[151]\n\n\nLondon's bid featured the same 28 sports that had been included in other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop baseball and softball from the 2012 Games just two days after London had been selected as the host city. There was an appeal, but the IOC voted to uphold the decision, and the two sports were scheduled to be discontinued after their last appearance at the 2008 Olympics.[152] The IOC then voted on whether or not to replace them; karate, squash, golf, roller sports and rugby sevens were considered. Karate and squash were the two final nominees, but neither received enough votes to reach the required two-thirds majority.[152]\n\n\nAlthough formal demonstration sports were eliminated after the 1992 Summer Olympics,[153] special tournaments for non-Olympic sports can be run during the Games, such as the Wushu tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[154] There were attempts to run Twenty20 cricket[154] and netball[155] tournaments alongside the 2012 Games, but neither campaign was successful.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nThe final official schedule was released on 15 February 2011.[156]\n\n\n\n*All times and dates use British Summer Time (UTC+1)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Records[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mo Farah (left) with Usain Bolt (right), demonstrating one another's famous gestures (the \"Lightning Bolt\" and \"Mobot\")\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nThese Olympic Games resulted in 32 world records in eight sports. The largest number of records were set in swimming, at eight. China, Great Britain and the United States set the most records, at five each.\n\n\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2012 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nA total of 85 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) won medals, 54 of those countries winning at least one gold medal. Seven NOCs won their first ever Olympic medal: Bahrain (gold),[157] Botswana (silver),[158] Cyprus (silver),[159] Gabon (silver),[160] Grenada (gold),[161] Guatemala (silver),[162] and Montenegro (silver).[163] The United States finished at the top of the table, winning 47 gold medals and a total of 104 medals. China finished second with 38 gold medals and 91 medals overall, and hosts Great Britain came in third place, winning 29 gold medals and 65 medals overall in their best performance since London hosted its first Summer Olympics in 1908, pushing Russia—who won 18 gold medals and 66 medals in total, after doping redistributions (initially 24 gold and 82 total)—into fourth place.\n\n\n\nKey\n  ‡   Changes in medal standings (see subpage)\n\n\n\n  \\*   Host nation (Great Britain)\n\n\n\n2012 Summer Olympics medal table[164]| Rank | NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States‡ | 48 | 26 | 30 | 104 |\n| 2 | ![](image) China‡ | 39 | 31 | 22 | 92 |\n| 3 | ![](image) Great Britain\\*‡ | 29 | 18 | 18 | 65 |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia‡ | 18 | 21 | 26 | 65 |\n| 5 | ![](image) South Korea‡ | 13 | 9 | 9 | 31 |\n| 6 | ![](image) Germany‡ | 11 | 20 | 13 | 44 |\n| 7 | ![](image) France‡ | 11 | 11 | 13 | 35 |\n| 8 | ![](image) Australia‡ | 8 | 15 | 12 | 35 |\n| 9 | ![](image) Italy | 8 | 9 | 11 | 28 |\n| 10 | ![](image) Hungary‡ | 8 | 4 | 6 | 18 |\n| 11–86 | Remaining NOCs | 110 | 141 | 193 | 444 |\n| Totals (86 entries) | 303 | 305 | 353 | 961 |\n\n\n### Podium sweeps[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Sport\n | Event\n | NOC\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 28 July\n | Fencing | Women's foil | ![](image) Italy | Elisa Di Francisca | Arianna Errigo | Valentina Vezzali |\n| 9 August\n | Athletics | Men's 200 metres | ![](image) Jamaica | Usain Bolt | Yohan Blake | Warren Weir |\n| 11 August\n | Athletics | Women's 20 kilometres walk[165] | ![](image) China | Qieyang Shenjie | Liu Hong | Lü Xiuzhi |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2012 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\n![](image)Here East, the former London Olympics Media Centre. It now accommodates campuses for Staffordshire University, Loughborough University and University College London an is a location for start-up businesses.[166]\nThe host broadcaster was Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS), an agency of the IOC. The OBS used its own cameras and crews subcontracted from other Olympic broadcasters to cover the events. The base video and audio were sold to other broadcasters, who added their own commentary and presentation.\n\n\nThe official recording format of the 2012 Summer Olympics used Panasonic's digital technologies. The official video was produced and distributed from the International Broadcast Centre in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format. Panasonic announced that DVCPRO HD would be the official recording format. OBS London used P2 HD shoulder-mount camcorders.[167]\n\n\nThe IOC wanted television coverage to reach as broad a worldwide audience as possible, and several national and regional broadcasters covered London 2012. In the UK, the BBC carried the Olympics and Channel 4 the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games.[168] BBC Parliament's Freeview channel was suspended, BBC Three's on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.\n\n\nThe US television rights, owned by NBC, accounted for more than half the rights revenue for the IOC. Despite high viewership, many viewers were disappointed with NBC's coverage.[169] The operations of broadcasters granted rights to the Games were hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park. YouTube planned to stream the Games in 64 territories in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where there were no official broadcasters.[170]\n\n\nIn Sri Lanka a dispute occurred between Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) and MBC Networks (MTV/MBC) as to who was the official broadcaster of the Games. This problem was caused as Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) had offered the official broadcasting rights to both networks, as both of the networks were ABU members. So SLRC filed a case against MBC Networks for broadcasting rights at the Colombo Magistrate's Court. Considering the case, the court issued a special court order preventing MBC Networks' Olympic broadcast and stated that SLRC should be the sole broadcaster.[171] However, when the Games started, both networks broadcast most of the events simultaneously. Another dispute had previously occurred between Carlton Sports Network (CSN) and SLRC, but the Sports Minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, had stated that SLRC had the exclusive rights.[172]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2012, the IOC announced the winners of the Golden Ring Awards for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to the sailing, produced by Christopher Lincoln, Gary Milkis, and Ursula Romero. The production for the canoe/kayak slalom and the rowing/canoe sprint came second and third respectively. The award for Best On Air Promotion went to NBC with Foxtel and ZDF finishing second and third. NBC Olympics also won the Best Olympic Feature category, as Sky Italia came second and ZDF third. The Best Athlete Profile award went to TV Record's profile of Sarah Menezes, NBC came second with their profile of David Rudisha, and ESPN Latin America took third place with a profile of Miguel Correa and Ruben Rezola. The award for Best Olympic Programme went to NBC, host broadcasters the BBC took second place for Super Saturday (the middle Saturday of the Games), and third place was claimed by the Nine Network for their live coverage of Day 16 of the Games.[173]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n\"Survival\" by Muse was announced as the official song of the Olympics,[174] to be played by international broadcasters reporting on the Games.[175] The track was noted to express a sense of conviction and determination to win.[176] In August 2009, the Royal Mail commissioned artists and illustrators to design 30 stamps, which were released in batches of 10 between 2009 and 2011.[177] The last ones were released on 22 July 2011.[178] Two £5 coins designed by Saiman Miah have been made to commemorate the Olympics.[179] As with other Olympics since 1952, the Royal Mint will strike a set of commemorative one-kilogram gold and silver coins.[180]\n\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nThe official motto for the 2012 Summer Olympics is \"Inspire a generation\". It was chosen to highlight the organisers' commitment to inspire the world, including younger generations, to get involved in sporting events through the Games' legacy.[181]\n\n\n\n### Logo and graphics[edit]\n\n\nThere have been two London 2012 logos: one used for the bidding process, and the other used in the branding for the Games themselves. The bid logo, created by Kino Design, was a ribbon with blue, yellow, black, green, and red stripes winding through the text \"LONDON 2012\", making the shape of the River Thames in East London. The main logo, designed by Wolff Olins and published on 4 June 2007, is a representation of the number 2012, with the Olympic Rings embedded within the zero.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Paralympics logo (far left) and the different official colour combinations for the Wolff Olins main logo design\n\nPublic reaction to the main logo in a June 2007 BBC poll was largely mixed; more than 80% of votes gave it the lowest possible rating.[183] Several newspapers ran their own logo competitions, displaying alternative submissions from their readers,[184] and several writers from news agencies criticised the logo.[184][185][186] It was suggested that the logo resembled the American cartoon characters Lisa Simpson and Bart Simpson performing fellatio.[187][188] In February 2011, Iran threatened to boycott the Olympics, complaining that the logo appeared to spell out the word \"Zion\". However, this boycott did not occur.[189]\n\n\n\n### Colours[edit]\n\n\n     The four main colours used in the branding of the Games were pink, blue, green, and orange. These colours were chosen to showcase the spirit of the Games: energetic, spirited, youthful, and bright.\n\n\n    The auxiliary colours used in the branding were dark purple, grey, and gold. These were mostly used in symbols and graphics to offset the brightness of the main colours.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wenlock and Mandeville\n\n![](image)The Olympic Mascots, Mandeville (left) and Wenlock (right)\nThe official mascots for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games were unveiled on 19 May 2010, targeted for children.[190] Wenlock and Mandeville are animations depicting two drops of steel from a steelworks in Bolton.[190]\n\n\nThey are named after Much Wenlock, a town in Shropshire that holds a forerunner of the current Olympic Games, and Stoke Mandeville, a village in Buckinghamshire where a forerunner of the Paralympic Games was first held.[190] The writer Michael Morpurgo wrote the story concept for the mascots, and an animation was produced.[191] Two stories have been created about the mascots: *Out Of A Rainbow* and *Adventures On A Rainbow*.[192]\n\n\n*Creative Review* magazine liked the mascots,[193] but elsewhere their design was greeted with some disdain. However, the mascots' creators claim that young people find the duo appealing.[194]\n\n\n\n### *Chariots of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nThe 1981 Best Picture Oscar–winning film *Chariots of Fire*, which tells the story of two British athletes in the 1924 Olympics, was a recurring theme in promotions for the 2012 Olympics.[195] A digitally re-mastered version of *Chariots of Fire* was released on 13 July 2012 and screened in over 100 UK cinemas as part of the celebrations,[196] and a 2012 stage adaptation ran in London theatres from 9 May 2012 to 5 January 2013.[197] The film's theme tune was performed during the opening ceremony by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Simon Rattle. The performance was accompanied by a comedic skit by Rowan Atkinson, which included the opening beach-running footage from the film.[198] A new orchestration of the film's theme tune was played during each medal presentation of the Games.[199]\n\n\n\n### Sponsors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics marketing § Sponsors\n\nLOCOG and the IOC agreed sponsorship deals with several companies, each assigned to one of four categories; worldwide, tier one, tier two and tier three.[200] The worldwide partners were: Acer, Atos, Coca-Cola, Dow, General Electric, McDonald's, Omega SA, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble, Samsung and Visa.[200] Tier one partners were: Adidas, BMW, BP, British Airways, BT Group, EDF Energy and Lloyds TSB.[201] The tier two partners were: Adecco, ArcelorMittal, Cadbury, Deloitte, Thomas Cook Group, Cisco Systems and United Parcel Service.[201] Tier three partners were: Aggreko, Airwave, Atkins, The Boston Consulting Group, CBS Outdoor, Crystal CG, Eurostar, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, G4S, GlaxoSmithKline, Gymnova, Heathrow Airport, Heineken, Holiday Inn, John Lewis & Partners, McCann Worldgroup, Mondo, Nature Valley, Next, Nielsen Company, Populous (company), Rapiscan Systems, Rio Tinto (corporation), Technogym, Thames Water, Ticketmaster, Trebor and Westfield Group.[201] The companies provided £1.4 billion of funding altogether, allocated evenly between the IOC and LOCOG.[201]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nDuring the lead-up to the Games, there were controversies over sponsorship,[202] the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues. After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the Games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.[87]\n\n\nDuring the Games, eight competitors in the badminton women's doubles were disqualified for \"not using best efforts\", when they tried to lose matches in the group stage to obtain more favourable fixtures in the knockout rounds.[203][204] A number of results in boxing, gymnastics and judo were overturned by officials after initial decisions were appealed against.[205][206][207]\n\n\nYe Shiwen faced doping allegations after her gold medal in the women's 400m Individual Medley as she came from being behind the world record in the final 50m to beating it by 1.02 seconds. Furthermore, she swam her last 50m 0.17 seconds quicker than the men's winner of the corresponding race. All charges were later dropped.[208]\n\n\nJust before the start of the Men's 100m Final, a spectator threw a plastic bottle into Tyson Gay's lane, intended to hit Usain Bolt who was three lanes outside in Lane 7. The race was unaffected, and Bolt would go on to become the second man in history to defend a 100m Olympic title. The spectator, later identified as Ashley Gill-Webb, was soon arrested after he was struck on the head by Dutch judoka and bronze medalist Edith Bosch, whom he happened to be sitting next to.[209][210] LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe later stated: \"I'm not suggesting vigilantism, but it was actually poetic justice that they happened to be sitting next to a judo player\".[210] Gill-Webb later pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress at Stratford Magistrates' Court.[211] He was later found guilty.[212]\n\n\nIran lodged a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee after they claimed that the logo spelt the word 'Zion'.[213] The complaint was dismissed by the president of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, who said that the complaint \"can't be serious.\"[214]\n\n\n\n## Drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games § 2012 London\n\nIt was announced before the Summer Games that half of all the competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the Games and the end of the Paralympic Games.[215] Every competitor who won a medal was also tested. The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.[215] As of late 2022, 40 medals have been stripped due to doping violations, 17 of which were originally awarded to Russian athletes. Testing for drugs was completed by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline).[216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2012 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Great Britain\n\t+ 1908 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 1948 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 2012 Summer Olympics – London\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* 2012 Olympic hunger summit\n* *Twenty Twelve*, a comedy mockumentary featuring a fictional London Olympics committee\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The IOC numbers the Olympiads using Roman numerals.\n2. **^** Athens has also hosted three IOC-organised events, in 1896, 2004 and the Intercalated Games in 1906.

The first event, the group stage in women's football, began on 25 July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, followed by the opening ceremony on 27 July.[3][4] There were 10,518 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) who participated in the 2012 Olympics.[5]\n\n\nFollowing a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and the then-London mayor Ken Livingstone, London was selected as the host city at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore on 6 July 2005, defeating bids from Moscow, New York City, Madrid, and Paris.[6] London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times,[7][b] having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and 1948.[8][9] Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability.[10] The main focus was a new 200-hectare (490-acre) Olympic Park, constructed on a former industrial site in Stratford, East London.[11] The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid.[12]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (104). China finished second with a total of 91 medals (38 gold) and Great Britain came third with 65 medals overall (29 gold). Michael Phelps of the United States became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, winning his 22nd medal.[13] Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time, meaning that every currently eligible country has now sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games.[14] Women's boxing was included for the first time, and the 2012 Games became the first at which every sport had female competitors.[15][16][17]\n\n\nThe Games received considerable praise for their organisation, with the volunteers, the British military and public enthusiasm commended particularly highly.[18][19][20] The Games were described as \"happy and glorious\".[21] The opening ceremony, directed by Academy Award winner Danny Boyle, received widespread acclaim.[22][23] These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Belgian Jacques Rogge, who was succeeded by German Thomas Bach the next year.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nLondon was chosen over Birmingham to represent Great Britain's bid by the British Olympic Association.\n\n\nBy 15 July 2003—the deadline for interested cities to submit bids to the International Olympic Committee (IOC)—nine cities had submitted bids to host the 2012 Summer Olympics: Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig, London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro.[24] On 18 May 2004, as a result of a scored technical evaluation, the IOC reduced the number of cities to five: London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris.[25] All five submitted their candidate files by 19 November 2004 and were visited by the IOC inspection team during February and March 2005. The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits, and a report that a key member of the bid team, Guy Drut, would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.[26]\n\n\nThroughout the process, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as this was its third bid in recent years. London was initially seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin.[27] Its position began to improve after the appointment of Lord Coe as the new chair of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) on 19 May 2004.[28] In late August 2004, reports predicted a tie between London and Paris.[29]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2005, the IOC released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations.[30] On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, \"I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less.\"[31]\n\n\nOn 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore. Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two contenders were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes to 50.[32]\n\n\nThe celebrations in London were short-lived, being overshadowed by bombings on London's transport system less than 24 hours after the announcement.[33]\n\n\n\n\n\n**2012 host city election – ballot results**\n| City\n | NOC\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** |\n| London | ![](image) Great Britain | **22** | 27 | **39** | **54** |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 21 | 25 | 33 | 50\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | 20 | **32** | 31 | —\n |\n| New York City | ![](image) United States | 19 | 17 | — | —\n |\n| Moscow | ![](image) Russia | 15 | — | — | —\n |\n|  | **Total ballots** | 97\n | 101\n | 103\n | 104\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympic development\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) was created to oversee the staging of the Games, and held its first board meeting on 3 October 2005.[34] The committee, chaired by Lord Coe, was in charge of implementing and staging the Games, while the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), established in April 2006, was in charge of construction of the venues and infrastructure.[34][35]\n\n\nThe Government Olympic Executive (GOE), a unit within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), was the lead government body for coordinating the London 2012 Olympics. It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme management, and the London 2012 Olympic Legacy before and after the Games that would benefit London and the wider United Kingdom. The organisation was also responsible for the supervision of the £9.3 billion of public sector funding.[36]\n\n\nIn August 2011, security concerns arose surrounding the hosting of the Olympic Games in London, following the 2011 England riots.[37] Some countries expressed safety concerns,[38] despite the IOC's assurance that the riots would not affect the Games.[39] The IOC's Coordination Commission for the 2012 Games completed its tenth and final visit to London in March 2012. Its members concluded that \"London is ready to host the world this summer\".[40]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\nThe 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade. After the Games, some of the new facilities would be reused in their Olympic form, while others will be resized or relocated.[41]\n\n\nThe majority of venues were divided into three zones within Greater London: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. In addition there were a few venues that, by necessity, were outside the boundaries of Greater London, such as the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy some 125 mi (201 km) southwest of London, which hosted the sailing events. The football tournament was staged at several grounds around the UK.[42] Work began on the Park in December 2006, when a sports hall in Eton Manor was pulled down.[43] The athletes' village in Portland was completed in September 2011.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)London Olympic Stadium\nIn November 2004, the 200-hectare (500-acre) Olympic Park plans were revealed.[45] The plans for the site were approved in September 2004 by Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Waltham Forest.[46] The redevelopment of the area to build the Olympic Park required compulsory purchase orders of property. The London Development Agency was in dispute with London and Continental Railways about the orders in November 2005. By May 2006, 86% of the land had been bought as businesses fought eviction.[47] Residents who opposed the eviction tried to find ways to stop it by setting up campaigns, but they had to leave as 94% of land was bought and the other 6% bought as a £9 billion regeneration project started.[48]\n\n\nThere were some issues with the original venues not being challenging enough or being financially unviable. Both the Olympic road races and the mountain bike event were initially considered to be too easy, so they were eventually scheduled on new locations.[49][50] The Olympic marathon course, which was set to finish in the Olympic stadium, was moved to The Mall, since closing Tower Bridge was deemed to cause traffic problems in central London.[51] North Greenwich Arena 2 was scrapped in a cost-cutting exercise, Wembley Arena being used for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics events instead.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of *London Prepares*.[56] Team GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Designed by architects Gebler Tooth on the top floor of an office building in Westfield Stratford City, it combined the team HQ, athletes' \"Friends and Family\" lounge, Press Centre, and VIP lounge.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Olympic Javelin high-speed service ran between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet, via Stratford.\nIOC's initial evaluation felt that, if transport improvements were delivered in time for the Games, London would cope.[57] Transport for London (TfL) carried out numerous improvements in preparation for 2012, including the expansion of the London Overground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the introduction of a new \"Javelin\" high-speed rail service.[58] According to Network Rail, an additional 4,000 train services operated during the Games, and train operators ran longer trains during the day.[59] During the Games, Stratford International station was not served by any international services (just as it had not been before the Games),[60] westbound trains did not stop at Hackney Wick railway station,[61] and Pudding Mill Lane DLR station closed entirely during the Games.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Emirates Air Line crosses the River Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks.\nTfL also built a £25 million cable car across the River Thames, called the Emirates Air Line, to link 2012 Olympics venues.[63] It was inaugurated in June 2012 and crosses the Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks, carrying up to 2,500 passengers an hour, cutting journey times between the O2 arena and the ExCeL exhibition centre and providing a crossing every 30 seconds.[64]\n\n\nThe plan was to have 80% of athletes travel less than 20 minutes to their event[65] and 93% of them within 30 minutes of their event.[66] The Olympic Park would be served by ten separate railway lines with a combined capacity of 240,000 passengers per hour.[67] In addition, LOCOG planned for 90% of the venues to be served by three or more types of public transport.[66] Two park-and-ride sites off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars were 25 minutes away from the Olympic Park. Another park-and-ride site was planned in Ebbsfleet with a capacity for 9,000 cars where spectators could board a 10-minute shuttle train service.[66] To get spectators to Eton Dorney, four park-and-ride schemes were set up.[68] These Park and Ride services were operated by First Games Transport.[69]\n\n\nTfL defined a network of roads leading between venues as the Olympic Route Network; roads connecting all of the Olympic venues located within London. Many of these roads also contained special \"Olympic lanes\" marked with the Olympic rings—reserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of £130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes.[70][71][72] Concerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the sailing events at Portland had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer.[73] However, a £77 million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.[74][75] Some £16 million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.[76]\n\n\nTfL created a promotional campaign and website, *Get Ahead of the Games*, to help provide information related to transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. Through the campaign, TfL also encouraged the use of cycling as a mode of transport.[77] A temporary terminal was created at Heathrow Airport to be used by 10,100 departing athletes after the Games. Up to 35% more bags than normal were expected on 13 August, which was predicted to be the busiest day in the airport's history, according to Nick Cole, head of Olympic and Paralympic planning at Heathrow.\n\n\n\n### Cost and financing[edit]\n\n\nA study from Oxford University found that the sports-related costs of London 2012 amounted to US$15 billion, compared with $4.6 billion for Rio 2016, $40–44 billion for Beijing 2008, and $51 billion for Sochi 2014 (the most expensive Olympics in history). London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion. Cost per athlete was $1.4 million.[78] This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often equal or exceed the sports-related costs.\n\n\nThe costs of staging the Games were separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park. While the Games were privately funded, the venues and infrastructure were largely financed using public money.\n\n\nAccording to *The Wall Street Journal*, the original budget for the Games was increased to about £9.3 billion (US$15.28 billion) in 2007.[79] The revised figures were announced to the House of Commons on 15 March 2007 by Tessa Jowell. Along with East End regeneration costs, the breakdown was:\n\n\n\n* Building the venues and infrastructure – £5.3 billion\n* Elite sport and Paralympic funding – £400 million\n* Security and policing – £600 million\n* Regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley – £1.7 billion\n* Contingency fund – £2.7 billion\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers known as Games Makers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games.[80] A target of 70,000 volunteers was set as early as 2004.[81] When recruitment took place in 2010, more than 240,000 applications were received.[82] Sebastian Coe said in February 2012, \"Our Games Makers will contribute a total of around eight million volunteer hours during the Games and the Games simply wouldn't happen without them\".[83] The volunteers wore clothing that included purple and red polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, grey socks and grey-and-white trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges that were also worn by officials, athletes, family members and media, which gained them access to specific venues and buildings around the site.\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nOrganisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games,[84] and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games.[84] LOCOG aimed to raise £375–£400 million in ticket sales. There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling,[85] although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed.[86] Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold.[87] Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence. European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country.[88]\n\n\nIn Great Britain, ticket prices ranged from £20 for many events to £2,012 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. Some free tickets were given to military personnel as part of the Tickets For Troops scheme,[89] as well as to survivors and families of those who died during 7 July 2005 London bombings.[90] Initially, people were able to apply for tickets via a website from 15 March until 26 April 2011. There was a huge demand for tickets, with a demand of more than three times the number of tickets available.[91][92] On 11 May 2012 a round of nearly one million \"second chance\" tickets went on sale over a 10-day period between 23 June and 3 July 2011.[93] About 1.7 million tickets were available for football and 600,000 for other sports, including archery, field hockey, football, judo, boxing and volleyball. Ten sports had sold out by 8 am of the first day.[94]\n\n\n\n### Countdown[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Countdown Clock in Trafalgar Square\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, the Olympic Flag was formally handed over from the Mayor of Beijing to the Mayor of London. This was followed by a section highlighting London,[95] One month later, the Olympic and Paralympic flags were raised outside the London City Hall.[96]\n\n\nA countdown clock in Trafalgar Square was unveiled, 500 days before the Games.[97][98] It was a two-sided clock with the Paralympic countdown on the other side. The countdown to the start of the Olympics began with a ceremony for the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece.[99]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Security for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Controversies surrounding G4S\n\nThe police led the security operation (named **Operation Olympics** by the Ministry of Defence), with 10,000 officers available, supported by 13,500 members of the British Armed Forces. Naval and air assets were deployed as part of the security operation, including ships situated in the Thames, Typhoon fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles;[100] it was the biggest security operation Britain had faced in decades. The cost of security increased from £282 million to £553 million, and the figure of 13,500 armed forces personnel was greater than the number deployed at the time in Afghanistan.[101] The Metropolitan Police and the Royal Marines carried out security exercises in preparation for the Olympics on 19 January 2012, with 50 marine police officers in rigid inflatables and fast response boats, joined by up to 100 military personnel and a Royal Navy Lynx helicopter.[102]\n\n\nThe Ministry of Defence distributed leaflets to residents of the Lexington building in Bow, announcing that a missile system was to be stationed on top of the water tower.[103][104] This caused concern to some residents.[103][104] The Ministry said it probably would use Starstreak missiles and that site evaluations had taken place, but that no final decision had taken place.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front of the Silver Medal won by the USA.\nApproximately 4,700[105] Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant.[106] They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics).[107] 99% of the gold, silver and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S.[108] The remaining 1% came from a Mongolian mine.[109] Each medal weighs 375–400 g (13.2–14.1 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 7 mm (0.28 in) thick, with the sport and discipline engraved on the rim.[110] The obverse, as is traditional, features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, stepping from the Panathinaiko Stadium that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, with Parthenon in the background; the reverse features the Games logo, the River Thames and a series of lines representing \"the energy of athletes and a sense of pulling together\".[111] The medals were transferred to the Tower of London vaults on 2 July 2012 for storage.[110]\n\n\nEach gold medal is 92.5 percent silver and 1.34 percent gold, with the remainder copper. The silver medal is 92.5 percent silver, with the remainder copper. The bronze medal is made up of 97 percent copper, 2.5 percent zinc, and 0.5 per cent tin.[112] The value of the materials in the gold medal was about £410 (US$644), the silver about £210 (US$330), and the bronze about £3 (US$4.71) as of 30 July 2012.[113]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe Olympics torch relay ran from 19 May to 27 July 2012, before the Games. Plans for the relay were developed in 2010–11, with the torch-bearer selection process announced on 18 May 2011.[114] The torch was designed by Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby.\n\n\nOn 18 May 2012 the Olympic flame arrived at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall from Greece[115] on flight BA2012, operated by a British Airways Airbus A319 named \"Firefly\". The relay lasted 70 days, with 66 evening celebrations and six island visits, and involved some 8,000 people carrying the torch about 8,000 mi (12,875 km), starting from Land's End in Cornwall.[116] The torch had three days outside the United Kingdom when it visited the Isle of Man on 2 June, Dublin in Ireland, on 6 June,[117] and both Guernsey and Jersey on 15 July.\n\n\nThe relay focused on National Heritage Sites, locations with sporting significance, key sporting events, schools registered with the Get Set School Network, green spaces and biodiversity, Live Sites (city locations with large screens), and festivals and other events.[118] Dumfries and Galloway was the only Region in the whole of the United Kingdom that had the Olympic Torch pass through it twice. A group of young athletes, nominated by retired Olympic athletes, ran the torch around the stadium. These torchbearers were Callum Airlie, Jordan Duckitt, Desiree Henry, Katie Kirk, Cameron MacRitchie, Aidan Reynolds, and Adelle Tracey. Together the torchbearers each lit a petal that spread the fire to the 204 petals of the cauldron, representing the countries that participated in the Games.[119] The cauldron was designed by Thomas Heatherwick.\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nThe Olympic Park was planned to incorporate 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, with a total of 525 bird boxes and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process.[120] Renewable energy also featured at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, only 9% of it was achieved.[121] Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames. These plans were scrapped for safety reasons.[122] The focus subsequently moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste. Where it could not be reused or recycled, food packaging for use at the Olympics—including fast-food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons—was made from compostable materials like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics. After use, many of these materials were suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.[123]\n\n\nPost-Games, buildings like the Water Polo Arena were relocated elsewhere. Building parts like roofing covers and membranes of different temporary venues were recycled via VinyLoop. This allowed organisers to meet the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection.\n\n\nLondon 2012 inaugurated Olympic Games guidelines that included the recycling of PVC, which was used for temporary buildings such as the Basketball Arena and for the temporary parts of permanent venues such as the Olympic Stadium.[124] In the Water Polo Arena, PVC roofing was made from recycled cushions to provide insulation.[125] Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy was fulfilled; the policy states:[126]\n\n\n\nWhere London 2012 procures PVC for temporary usage or where permanent usage is not assured, London 2012 is required to ensure that there is a take-back scheme that offers a closed-loop reuse system or mechanical recycling system for post-consumer waste.\nAccording to Kirsten Henson, Materials Manager for the London 2012 Olympic Park: \"The majority of temporary facilities created for the Olympic Games including the Aquatic centre temporary stands, basketball arena, Water Polo Arena, and the shooting facilities at the Royal Artillery Barracks, are essentially big tents. Basically, PVC stretched over lightweight steel frame. This design solution makes them efficient to install, reduces the need for any significant foundations and are, of course, reusable. We were challenged by the public around the use of PVC; but we considered it to be the right material for certain functions. We therefore challenged the PVC supply chain to have certain environmental performance criteria in place, including a take back and recycle scheme.\"[127]\n\n\n\n### Cultural Olympiad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Cultural Olympiad\n\n![](image)Tower Bridge was illuminated with the Olympic Rings in the week leading up to the opening ceremony.\nThe Olympic Charter, the set of rules and guidelines for the organization of the Olympic Games and for governing the Olympic Movement, states that\n\n\n\n\n> LOCOG shall organise a programme of cultural events which must cover at least the entire period during which the Olympic Village is open.[128]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Cultural Olympiad comprised many programmes, with more than 500 events spread over four years across the whole of the United Kingdom, and culminating in the London 2012 Festival.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks at the opening ceremony\nTitled \"The Isles of Wonder\", the opening ceremony began at 21:00 British Summer Time (UTC+1) on 27 July in the Olympic Stadium.[131] Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle was artistic director and Rick Smith of Underworld was musical director.[132] The opening ceremony was immediately seen as a tremendous success, widely praised as a \"masterpiece\" and \"a love letter to Britain\".[133][134] The principal sections of the artistic display represented Britain's Industrial Revolution, National Health Service, literary heritage, popular music and culture, and were noted for their vibrant storytelling and use of music.\n\n\nThe Games were officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[135] This was the second Olympic Games opened personally by the Queen, the first being in 1976 in Montreal, Canada. The ceremony featured a short comic film starring Daniel Craig as secret agent James Bond and the Queen as herself.[136] There was also a musical comedy item starring Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean playing along with the London Symphony Orchestra.[137] These were widely ascribed to Britain's sense of humour.[138]\n\n\nLive musical performers included Frank Turner, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Mike Oldfield, Dizzee Rascal, Arctic Monkeys, and Sir Paul McCartney who performed \"Hey Jude\" as the closing act.[139][140] Broadcast live on BBC One, the ceremony attracted a peak viewing audience of over 27 million in the UK.[141]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 12 August. It featured a flashback fiesta to British music with The Who closing the performance. The ceremony also included a handover of the Olympic flag by Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the host city of the 2016 Summer Olympics.[142] In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"happy and glorious\".[21]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Number of participating

countries and continents had a \"national house\". These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout London.[147][148]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Nation | Location | Name\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| African nations | Kensington Gardens |\n| Austria | Trinity House |\n| Belgium | Inner Temple |\n| Brazil | Somerset House | Casa Brasil\n |\n| Canada | Canada House |\n| China | The Waldorf Hilton |\n| Croatia | Pelham Hotel, South Kensington |\n| Czech Republic | Business Design Centre, Islington |\n| Denmark | St Katherine Docks |\n| France | Old Billingsgate | Club France\n |\n| Georgia | Chelsea College of Art and Design (45 Millbank)\n |\n| Germany | Museum of London Docklands | Deutsches Haus\n |\n| Great Britain | Westfield Stratford City |\n| Ireland | The Big Chill House, Kings Cross |\n| Italy | Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre | Casa Italia\n |\n| Japan | Royal Aeronautical Society |\n| Jamaica | The O2 |\n| Kenya | East Thames Community Centre, Stratford |\n| Korea | Royal Thames Yacht Club |\n| Monaco | Haymarket |\n| Netherlands | Alexandra Palace | Holland Heineken House |\n| New Zealand | Granary Square, Kings Cross | Kiwi House\n |\n| Nigeria | Theatre Royal Stratford East |\n| Poland | Polish Social and Cultural Centre |\n| Qatar | Institution of Engineering and Technology, Savoy Place |\n| Romania | 30 Pavilion Road, Knightsbridge |\n| Russia | Perks Field, Kensington Palace |\n| Slovakia | Institute of Directors |\n| South Africa | Queen Elizabeth Hall |\n| South Pacific | St Katharine Docks |\n| Switzerland | Glazier's Hall |\n| Trinidad & Tobago | Tricycle Theatre |\n| USA | Royal College of Art |\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2012 Summer Olympics featured 26 different sports encompassing 39 disciplines and 302 events. In the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics Sports Programme\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (34)\n\t+ ![](image) Synchronized swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (4)\n* ![](image) Athletics (47)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* ![](image) Basketball (2)\n* ![](image) Boxing (13)\n | * ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n* ![](image) Cycling (competitors)\n\t+ BMX (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road (4)\n\t+ Track (10)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n | * ![](image) Fencing (10)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n* ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (14)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (4)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (11)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (7)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\nWomen's boxing was included in the programme for the first time, and 36 women competed in three weight classes. There was a special dispensation for the shooting events, which would otherwise have been illegal under UK gun law.[149][150] In tennis, mixed doubles returned to the Olympic programme for the first time since 1924.[151]\n\n\nLondon's bid featured the same 28 sports that had been included in other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop baseball and softball from the 2012 Games just two days after London had been selected as the host city. There was an appeal, but the IOC voted to uphold the decision, and the two sports were scheduled to be discontinued after their last appearance at the 2008 Olympics.[152] The IOC then voted on whether or not to replace them; karate, squash, golf, roller sports and rugby sevens were considered. Karate and squash were the two final nominees, but neither received enough votes to reach the required two-thirds majority.[152]\n\n\nAlthough formal demonstration sports were eliminated after the 1992 Summer Olympics,[153] special tournaments for non-Olympic sports can be run during the Games, such as the Wushu tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[154] There were attempts to run Twenty20 cricket[154] and netball[155] tournaments alongside the 2012 Games, but neither campaign was successful.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2012 Summer

Records[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mo Farah (left) with Usain Bolt (right), demonstrating one another's famous gestures (the \"Lightning Bolt\" and \"Mobot\")\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nThese Olympic Games resulted in 32 world records in eight sports. The largest number of records were set in swimming, at eight. China, Great Britain and the United States set the most records, at five each.\n\n\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2012 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nA total of 85 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) won medals, 54 of those countries winning at least one gold medal. Seven NOCs won their first ever Olympic medal: Bahrain (gold),[157] Botswana (silver),[158] Cyprus (silver),[159] Gabon (silver),[160] Grenada (gold),[161] Guatemala (silver),[162] and Montenegro (silver).[163] The United States finished at the top of the table, winning 47 gold medals and a total of 104 medals. China finished second with 38 gold medals and 91 medals overall, and hosts Great Britain came in third place, winning 29 gold medals and 65 medals overall in their best performance since London hosted its first Summer Olympics in 1908, pushing Russia—who won 18 gold medals and 66 medals in total, after doping redistributions (initially 24 gold and 82 total)—into fourth place.\n\n\n\nKey\n  ‡   Changes in medal standings (see subpage)\n\n\n\n  \\*   Host nation (Great Britain)\n\n\n\n2012 Summer Olympics medal table[164]| Rank | NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States‡ | 48 | 26 | 30 | 104 |\n| 2 | ![](image) China‡ | 39 | 31 | 22 | 92 |\n| 3 | ![](image) Great Britain\\*‡ | 29 | 18 | 18 | 65 |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia‡ | 18 | 21 | 26 | 65 |\n| 5 | ![](image) South Korea‡ | 13 | 9 | 9 | 31 |\n| 6 | ![](image) Germany‡ | 11 | 20 | 13 | 44 |\n| 7 | ![](image) France‡ | 11 | 11 | 13 | 35 |\n| 8 | ![](image) Australia‡ | 8 | 15 | 12 | 35 |\n| 9 | ![](image) Italy | 8 | 9 | 11 | 28 |\n| 10 | ![](image) Hungary‡ | 8 | 4 | 6 | 18 |\n| 11–86 | Remaining NOCs | 110 | 141 | 193 | 444 |\n| Totals (86 entries) | 303 | 305 | 353 | 961 |\n\n\n### Podium sweeps[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Sport\n | Event\n | NOC\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 28 July\n | Fencing | Women's foil | ![](image) Italy | Elisa Di Francisca | Arianna Errigo | Valentina Vezzali |\n| 9 August\n | Athletics | Men's 200 metres | ![](image) Jamaica | Usain Bolt | Yohan Blake | Warren Weir |\n| 11 August\n | Athletics | Women's 20 kilometres walk[165] | ![](image) China | Qieyang Shenjie | Liu Hong | Lü Xiuzhi |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2012 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\n![](image)Here East, the former London Olympics Media Centre. It now accommodates campuses for Staffordshire University, Loughborough University and University College London an is a location for start-up businesses.[166]\nThe host broadcaster was Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS), an agency of the IOC. The OBS used its own cameras and crews subcontracted from other Olympic broadcasters to cover the events. The base video and audio were sold to other broadcasters, who added their own commentary and presentation.\n\n\nThe official recording format of the 2012 Summer Olympics used Panasonic's digital technologies. The official video was produced and distributed from the International Broadcast Centre in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format. Panasonic announced that DVCPRO HD would be the official recording format. OBS London used P2 HD shoulder-mount camcorders.[167]\n\n\nThe IOC wanted television coverage to reach as broad a worldwide audience as possible, and several national and regional broadcasters covered London 2012. In the UK, the BBC carried the Olympics and Channel 4 the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games.[168] BBC Parliament's Freeview channel was suspended, BBC Three's on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.\n\n\nThe US television rights, owned by NBC, accounted for more than half the rights revenue for the IOC. Despite high viewership, many viewers were disappointed with NBC's coverage.[169] The operations of broadcasters granted rights to the Games were hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park. YouTube planned to stream the Games in 64 territories in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where there were no official broadcasters.[170]\n\n\nIn Sri Lanka a dispute occurred between Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) and MBC Networks (MTV/MBC) as to who was the official broadcaster of the Games. This problem was caused as Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) had offered the official broadcasting rights to both networks, as both of the networks were ABU members. So SLRC filed a case against MBC Networks for broadcasting rights at the Colombo Magistrate's Court. Considering the case, the court issued a special court order preventing MBC Networks' Olympic broadcast and stated that SLRC should be the sole broadcaster.[171] However, when the Games started, both networks broadcast most of the events simultaneously. Another dispute had previously occurred between Carlton Sports Network (CSN) and SLRC, but the Sports Minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, had stated that SLRC had the exclusive rights.[172]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2012, the IOC announced the winners of the Golden Ring Awards for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to the sailing, produced by Christopher Lincoln, Gary Milkis, and Ursula Romero. The production for the canoe/kayak slalom and the rowing/canoe sprint came second and third respectively. The award for Best On Air Promotion went to NBC with Foxtel and ZDF finishing second and third. NBC Olympics also won the Best Olympic Feature category, as Sky Italia came second and ZDF third. The Best Athlete Profile award went to TV Record's profile of Sarah Menezes, NBC came second with their profile of David Rudisha, and ESPN Latin America took third place with a profile of Miguel Correa and Ruben Rezola. The award for Best Olympic Programme went to NBC, host broadcasters the BBC took second place for Super Saturday (the middle Saturday of the Games), and third place was claimed by the Nine Network for their live coverage of Day 16 of the Games.[173]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n\"Survival\" by Muse was announced as the official song of the Olympics,[174] to be played by international broadcasters reporting on the Games.[175] The track was noted to express a sense of conviction and determination to win.[176] In August 2009, the Royal Mail commissioned artists and illustrators to design 30 stamps, which were released in batches of 10 between 2009 and 2011.[177] The last ones were released on 22 July 2011.[178] Two £5 coins designed by Saiman Miah have been made to commemorate the Olympics.[179] As with other Olympics since 1952, the Royal Mint will strike a set of commemorative one-kilogram gold and silver coins.[180]\n\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nThe official motto for the 2012 Summer Olympics is \"Inspire a generation\". It was chosen to highlight the organisers' commitment to inspire the world, including younger generations, to get involved in sporting events through the Games' legacy.[181]\n\n\n\n### Logo and graphics[edit]\n\n\nThere have been two London 2012 logos: one used for the bidding process, and the other used in the branding for the Games themselves. The bid logo, created by Kino Design, was a ribbon with blue, yellow, black, green, and red stripes winding through the text \"LONDON 2012\", making the shape of the River Thames in East London. The main logo, designed by Wolff Olins and published on 4 June 2007, is a representation of the number 2012, with the Olympic Rings embedded within the zero.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Paralympics logo (far left) and the different official colour combinations for the Wolff Olins main logo design\n\nPublic reaction to the main logo in a June 2007 BBC poll was largely mixed; more than 80% of votes gave it the lowest possible rating.[183] Several newspapers ran their own logo competitions, displaying alternative submissions from their readers,[184] and several writers from news agencies criticised the logo.[184][185][186] It was suggested that the logo resembled the American cartoon characters Lisa Simpson and Bart Simpson performing fellatio.[187][188] In February 2011, Iran threatened to boycott the Olympics, complaining that the logo appeared to spell out the word \"Zion\". However, this boycott did not occur.[189]\n\n\n\n### Colours[edit]\n\n\n     The four main colours used in the branding of the Games were pink, blue, green, and orange. These colours were chosen to showcase the spirit of the Games: energetic, spirited, youthful, and bright.\n\n\n    The auxiliary colours used in the branding were dark purple, grey, and gold. These were mostly used in symbols and graphics to offset the brightness of the main colours.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wenlock and Mandeville\n\n![](image)The Olympic Mascots, Mandeville (left) and Wenlock (right)\nThe official mascots for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games were unveiled on 19 May 2010, targeted for children.[190] Wenlock and Mandeville are animations depicting two drops of steel from a steelworks in Bolton.[190]\n\n\nThey are named after Much Wenlock, a town in Shropshire that holds a forerunner of the current Olympic Games, and Stoke Mandeville, a village in Buckinghamshire where a forerunner of the Paralympic Games was first held.[190] The writer Michael Morpurgo wrote the story concept for the mascots, and an animation was produced.[191] Two stories have been created about the mascots: *Out Of A Rainbow* and *Adventures On A Rainbow*.[192]\n\n\n*Creative Review* magazine liked the mascots,[193] but elsewhere their design was greeted with some disdain. However, the mascots' creators claim that young people find the duo appealing.[194]\n\n\n\n### *Chariots of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nThe 1981 Best Picture Oscar–winning film *Chariots of Fire*, which tells the story of two British athletes in the 1924 Olympics, was a recurring theme in promotions for the 2012 Olympics.[195] A digitally re-mastered version of *Chariots of Fire* was released on 13 July 2012 and screened in over 100 UK cinemas as part of the celebrations,[196] and a 2012 stage adaptation ran in London theatres from 9 May 2012 to 5 January 2013.[197] The film's theme tune was performed during the opening ceremony by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Simon Rattle. The performance was accompanied by a comedic skit by Rowan Atkinson, which included the opening beach-running footage from the film.[198] A new orchestration of the film's theme tune was played during each medal presentation of the Games.[199]\n\n\n\n### Sponsors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics marketing § Sponsors\n\nLOCOG and the IOC agreed sponsorship deals with several companies, each assigned to one of four categories; worldwide, tier one, tier two and tier three.[200] The worldwide partners were: Acer, Atos, Coca-Cola, Dow, General Electric, McDonald's, Omega SA, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble, Samsung and Visa.[200] Tier one partners were: Adidas, BMW, BP, British Airways, BT Group, EDF Energy and Lloyds TSB.[201] The tier two partners were: Adecco, ArcelorMittal, Cadbury, Deloitte, Thomas Cook Group, Cisco Systems and United Parcel Service.[201] Tier three partners were: Aggreko, Airwave, Atkins, The Boston Consulting Group, CBS Outdoor, Crystal CG, Eurostar, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, G4S, GlaxoSmithKline, Gymnova, Heathrow Airport, Heineken, Holiday Inn, John Lewis & Partners, McCann Worldgroup, Mondo, Nature Valley, Next, Nielsen Company, Populous (company), Rapiscan Systems, Rio Tinto (corporation), Technogym, Thames Water, Ticketmaster, Trebor and Westfield Group.[201] The companies provided £1.4 billion of funding altogether, allocated evenly between the IOC and LOCOG.[201]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nDuring the lead-up to the Games, there were controversies over sponsorship,[202] the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues. After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the Games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.[87]\n\n\nDuring the Games, eight competitors in the badminton women's doubles were disqualified for \"not using best efforts\", when they tried to lose matches in the group stage to obtain more favourable fixtures in the knockout rounds.[203][204] A number of results in boxing, gymnastics and judo were overturned by officials after initial decisions were appealed against.[205][206][207]\n\n\nYe Shiwen faced doping allegations after her gold medal in the women's 400m Individual Medley as she came from being behind the world record in the final 50m to beating it by 1.02 seconds. Furthermore, she swam her last 50m 0.17 seconds quicker than the men's winner of the corresponding race. All charges were later dropped.[208]\n\n\nJust before the start of the Men's 100m Final, a spectator threw a plastic bottle into Tyson Gay's lane, intended to hit Usain Bolt who was three lanes outside in Lane 7. The race was unaffected, and Bolt would go on to become the second man in history to defend a 100m Olympic title. The spectator, later identified as Ashley Gill-Webb, was soon arrested after he was struck on the head by Dutch judoka and bronze medalist Edith Bosch, whom he happened to be sitting next to.[209][210] LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe later stated: \"I'm not suggesting vigilantism, but it was actually poetic justice that they happened to be sitting next to a judo player\".[210] Gill-Webb later pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress at Stratford Magistrates' Court.[211] He was later found guilty.[212]\n\n\nIran lodged a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee after they claimed that the logo spelt the word 'Zion'.[213] The complaint was dismissed by the president of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, who said that the complaint \"can't be serious.\"[214]\n\n\n\n## Drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games § 2012 London\n\nIt was announced before the Summer Games that half of all the competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the Games and the end of the Paralympic Games.[215] Every competitor who won a medal was also tested. The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.[215] As of late 2022, 40 medals have been stripped due to doping violations, 17 of which were originally awarded to Russian athletes. Testing for drugs was completed by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline).[216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2012 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Great Britain\n\t+ 1908 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 1948 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 2012 Summer Olympics – London\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* 2012 Olympic hunger summit\n* *Twenty Twelve*, a comedy mockumentary featuring a fictional London Olympics committee\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The IOC numbers the Olympiads using Roman numerals.\n2. **^** Athens has also hosted three IOC-organised events, in 1896, 2004 and the Intercalated Games in 1906.
