She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with her 2006 self-titled album. Her next, *Fearless* (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to prominence. *Speak Now* (2010) infused rock influences, while *Red* (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with *1989* (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\".

Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[381][382][383] Swift is known for her ability to command large audiences, such as in a stadium,[384][385][386] without having to rely fully on dance like her contemporaries do.[387] According to *V* magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whethere she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[388]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[362][11][363] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[364][365][366] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; *Rolling Stone* described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[367][368] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[324] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[368] Despite the positive reception, *The New Yorker* stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[11] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[369][370][371] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[372]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Nc3H9O4drU3oUycWptG7iayW","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with her 2006 self-titled album. Her next, *Fearless* (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to prominence. *Speak Now* (2010) infused rock influences, while *Red* (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with *1989* (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\".

Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[381][382][383] Swift is known for her ability to command large audiences, such as in a stadium,[384][385][386] without having to rely fully on dance like her contemporaries do.[387] According to *V* magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whethere she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[388]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[362][11][363] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[364][365][366] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; *Rolling Stone* described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[367][368] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[324] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[368] Despite the positive reception, *The New Yorker* stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[11] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[369][370][371] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[372]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Nc3H9O4drU3oUycWptG7iayW","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Two years later, he co-founded the XO record label and released the mixtapes *House of Balloons*, *Thursday* and *Echoes of Silence*, which gained recognition for his style of contemporary and alternative R&B and the mystique surrounding his identity.[6] In 2012, he signed with Republic Records and rereleased the mixtapes in the compilation album *Trilogy*. He explored dark wave in his debut studio album *Kiss Land* (2013), which debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200. After its release, Tesfaye began contributing to film soundtracks, with his acclaimed single \"Earned It\" from *Fifty Shades of Grey* (2015) winning the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance, while also being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[7]\n\n\nTesfaye earned critical and commercial success with his pop-leaning second album *Beauty Behind the Madness* (2015), which reached number one in the US, contained the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart-topping singles \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills\", and won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album and was nominated for Album of the Year.[8] His trap-infused third album *Starboy* (2016) saw similar commercial success and included the US number-one single of the same name and \"Die for You\", and won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Tesfaye explored new wave and dream pop with his critically-acclaimed fourth studio album *After Hours* (2020), which featured the chart record-setting single \"Blinding Lights\" and the US number-one singles \"Heartless\" and \"Save Your Tears\".[9] Dance-pop inspired his fifth album *Dawn FM* (2022), which included the US top-ten single \"Take My Breath\". In 2023, he co-created and starred in the drama series *The Idol*, which was critically panned.\n\n\nAmong the world's best-selling music artists with over 75 million records sold,[10] Tesfaye holds several streaming and *Billboard* chart records.[11][12] He is the first Canadian artist to earn four diamond-certified singles from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), as well as the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three spots on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[13][14] \"Blinding Lights\" became the most-streamed song in Spotify history and the best-performing song in the *Billboard* Hot 100's history, as well as the longest charting song by a solo artist on the Billboard Hot 100.[15][16] Tesfaye was listed by *Time* as one of the world's most influential people in 2020, and was dubbed the \"world's most popular artist\" by *Guinness World Records* in 2023.[17][18] An advocate for racial equality and food security, he was appointed a World Food Programme Goodwill Ambassador in 2021.[19][20]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAbel Makkonen Tesfaye[a] was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario.[21] He is the only child of Ethiopian immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu,[b] who separated shortly after his birth.[23][24] He was brought up in the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother.[21][25] He has an estranged relationship with his father, telling *Rolling Stone* in 2015 that \"I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived — I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there.\"[24]\n\n\nTesfaye was raised as an Ethiopian Orthodox.[24][26] When asked whether or not he was still religious, he stated to *Variety* in 2020, \"I dunno...everything is a test, and if you are religious or spiritual, you have to go through things.\"[27] His native language is Amharic, which he learned through his grandmother.[28] He later became fluent in French by attending a French-immersion school.[29] He was further educated at West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute.[30]\n\n\nWhen he was 17, Tesfaye dropped out of school and moved to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with two friends; including his best friend and now creative director La Mar Taylor.[31] He has described this period as being like the 1995 film *Kids* \"without the AIDS\", as they lived a hedonistic lifestyle.[21][32] He has also experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to \"smarten up, to focus.\"[33][34]\n\n\nTesfaye often used drugs and abused illegal substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and cough syrup.[35] In December 2016, he stated that drugs were a \"crutch\" for him when it came to writing music.[36] In August 2021, during a cover story with *GQ*, he described himself as being \"sober lite\", meaning that he has stopped using drugs with the exception of marijuana. He also noted that he drinks alcohol occasionally, stating: \"I'm not a heavy drinker, as much as I used to be. The romance of drinking isn't there.\"[37]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2009–2011: Early beginnings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: House of Balloons, Thursday (album), and Echoes of Silence\n\nIn August 2009, Tesfaye began anonymously releasing music on YouTube.[38][39] The following year, he met Jeremy Rose, a producer who had an idea for a dark contemporary R&B project. After initially trying to pitch the idea to musician Curtis Santiago, Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who freestyle rapped over it. Rose produced three songs – \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\" and \"The Party & The After Party\" – and others that Tesfaye had sung on, which were ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would be credited for them.[40] In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\" and \"The Morning\" to YouTube under the username \"xoxxxoooxo\".[41][42] His identity was initially unknown. The songs drew some attention online, and were later included in a blog post from rapper Drake.[40][43] The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including *Pitchfork* and *The New York Times*.[44]\n\n\nBefore adopting the stage name the Weeknd, Tesfaye released music under the aliases the Noise and Kin Kane.[24] His current stage name was chosen in tribute to when he dropped out of school, took his mattress, \"left one weekend and never came home.\" However, Rose claims the name was his idea.[26][45] The last 'e' was excluded to avoid trademark problems with pop rock band the Weekend.[46] In the beginning of his career, Tesfaye worked at American Apparel. Due to his anonymity, his co-workers listened to his music without knowing it was him.[47][48][49]\n\n\nIn 2011, Tesfaye met music executives Wassim \"Sal\" Slaiby and Amir \"Cash\" Esmailian, with whom, along with Taylor, he founded the XO record label.[50] On March 21, Tesfaye released his debut mixtape *House of Balloons*.[51][52][53] The mixtape included production from producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, and included the tracks produced by Rose, although he did not receive production credits.[40] *House of Balloons* was named as one of ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.[54] On August 18, Tesfaye released his second mixtape *Thursday*, which received generally positive reviews.[55] His third mixtape, *Echoes of Silence*, was released on December 21. It was a longlisted nominee for the 2012 Polaris Music Prize.[56][57]\n\n\nIn July 2011, Tesfaye held his first live performance at the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto.[58] After the performance, Drake met with Tesfaye to discuss collaborations, which led to Tesfaye earning an appearance at his OVO Festival.[59] He also participated in concerts hosted by the Black Student Association at the University of Toronto.[49] Tesfaye contributed to four songs on Drake's second studio album *Take Care*, which was released on November 15, as a songwriter, producer and a featured artist on the album's seventh single \"Crew Love\".[60]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2014: *Trilogy* and *Kiss Land*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Trilogy (The Weeknd album) and Kiss Land\n\n![](image)Tesfaye performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2012\nBetween January and March 2012, Tesfaye performed at several Ontario universities, including Waterloo's Laurier University, Hamilton's Mohawk College and McMaster University.[61] In April, he began his first international tour; which included performances at Coachella,[62] sold-out shows at such venues as the Bowery Ballroom in New York City, which were positively reviewed by *Rolling Stone*,[62][63] and various European festivals, including Primavera Sound in Spain and Portugal,[64] and the Wireless Festival in the United Kingdom.[65][66][67] In September, Tesfaye signed with Republic Records and XO was assumed as a subsidiary label.[68] That same month, he began his first official concert tour: The Fall Tour, during which he opened for Florence and the Machine on their Ceremonials Tour in 5 cities, which included 2 shows at the iconic Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.\n\n\nOn November 13, 2012, Tesfaye released *Trilogy*, a compilation album consisting of re-mixed and remastered versions of his 2011 mixtapes and three additional tracks.[69][70][71] The album officially credited Rose as a producer and writer on the three songs from *House of Balloons* for which he did not initially receive credit.[72] *Trilogy* debuted at number four on the US *Billboard* 200 with first-week sales of 86,000 copies.

The remix marked their fourth collaboration.[238][239] In the *Billboard* Hot 100 issue dated March 11, 2023, the remix reached the top of the chart, becoming both artists' seventh number one hit.[240] On February 27, 2023, in the wake of the remix's success, the Weeknd became the first artist to surpass 100 million monthly listeners on Spotify.[241]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2023, the Weeknd released his first live album, titled *Live at SoFi Stadium.*[242] It featured recordings from his HBO concert film of the same name, showcasing the last concert of the North American leg of his After Hours til Dawn Tour at SoFi Stadium. He subsequently featured on four songs — \"Artificial Intelligence,\" \"Defame Moi,\" \"More Coke!!,\" and \"Emotionless\" — from Mike Dean's album *4:23*, released on April 29, 2023. In May 2023, the Weeknd stated that he was intending to retire the moniker of \"the Weeknd\" in favor of performing under his birth name, or adopting a new pseudonym altogether. He explained that his upcoming album would most likely serve as his \"final hurrah\" under the name.[243]\n\n\nThe Weeknd co-created the HBO drama series *The Idol* with Sam Levinson, and stars in the show alongside Lily-Rose Depp. The series premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival out of competition, where it received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of onscreen nudity and sexual content. The series debuted to widespread negative reviews from critics. *The Hollywood Reporter* stated that the series confirms the allegations that \"Instead of subtly skewering the misogynistic and predatory nature of the business, *The Idol* became a forbidden love story — the stuff of a toxic man’s fantasy\", and called it \"regressive rather than transgressive\".[244] He received negative reviews for his acting, with critic Robert Daniels of *The Playlist* writing, \"Tesfaye is also a terrible actor. He lacks the comfortability, the gravitas, charisma, and charm to increase the viability of Jocelyn being attracted to him. In most scenes, Tesfaye either hides under the cover of dim lighting, obtrusive coverage, or re-recorded dialogue dubbed into several scenes.\"[245] On August 28, 2023, HBO announced it had cancelled *The Idol* after one season.[246]\n\n\nOn June 8, 2023, the Weeknd announced an upcoming series of EPs featuring music from *The Idol.* Originally intended as a soundtrack album, each EP will be released following the premiere of each episode of the show.

Kelly as his main musical inspirations\n\nTesfaye cites Michael Jackson, Prince, and R. Kelly as his main musical inspirations.[249] He has attributed Jackson's music as key in spurring him to be a singer, referencing the lyrics to \"Dirty Diana\" as an example.[24] His high-flying vocal style was influenced by Ethiopian singers such as Aster Aweke.[24] He grew up listening to a variety of music genres, including soul, hip hop, funk, indie rock, and post-punk.[250] Tesfaye is heavily influenced by 1980s music, and credits the video game *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City* (2002) for \"opening my eyes\" to the music of that era.[251] \"I've always had an admiration for the era before I was born\", he said in an interview for *Billboard*. \"You can hear it as far back as my first mixtape that the '80s – Siouxsie and the Banshees, Cocteau Twins – play such a huge role in my sound.\"[252]\n\n\nTesfaye has named Deftones as one of his influences during the making of *House of Balloons*, *Thursday* and *Echoes of Silence*.[253] He has also cited Lana Del Rey,[254] David Bowie,[255] the Smiths, Bad Brains, Talking Heads, DeBarge,[256] 50 Cent, Wu-Tang Clan,[257][258] and Eminem as influences and inspirations.[259][260] When Daft Punk announced their split in 2021, Tesfaye praised them during an interview with *Variety*, saying: \"Those guys are one of the reasons I make music, so I can't even compare them to other people...\"[261]\n\n\n\n### Production and songwriting[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye's songs are \"built around a fogged, crepuscular production\",[262] and feature slow tempos,[263] rumbling bass, and forlorn echoes.[23] His music incorporates samples that are unconventional in R&B production, including punk, shoegaze, dream pop and alternative rock.[264] Marc Hogan of *Spin* says that Tesfaye's samples tend \"to draw from rock critic-approved sources, though generally ones that already share elements of his sexual menace\", sampling artists such as Beach House, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Aaliyah.[265] Tesfaye worked mostly with producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, whom Ian Cohen of *Pitchfork* credits with developing \"a state-of-the-art R&B template\" with the artist.[263] In concert, Tesfaye reappropriates his digitized productions with a suite-like arena rock aesthetic.[23]\n\n\nHis emotional, plaintive lyrics often express feelings of hurt and deal with subject matter such as sex,[262] drugs, and partying; this is seen especially in *After Hours* and *House of Balloons*.[23] Hermione Hoby of *The Guardian* characterizes Tesfaye's songs as \"narcotised-slow jams\" and delineates their message as \"partying is an existential experience, sex is fraught with alienation, and everything registers as unreal and unsettling.\"[262] Paul MacInnes of *The Guardian* stated that he views Tesfaye's three mixtapes as \"a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover.\"[266] Anupa Mistry of the *Toronto Standard* observes throughout his mixtapes a \"cast of supine, stoned zombie-women... whose legs willingly part after being plied with substances and who morph into threats only when [he is] coming down and feeling vulnerable.\"[23] Tesfaye has stated that by singing vulgar, ignorant lyrics in an elegant, sexy way, he is \"paying homage to R Kelly, and even Prince to a certain extent.\"[267]\n\n\n\n### Voice and music style[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye often sings in a falsetto register,[268] exhibiting an enticing tone. J. D. Considine finds his singing's \"tremulous quality\" similar to Michael Jackson, but writes that he eschews Jackson's \"strong basis in the blues\" for a more Arabic-influenced melisma.[264] Tesfaye possesses a wide light-lyric tenor vocal range, which spans over three octaves. His vocal range reaches its extreme low at the bass F (F2), and its peak high at the tenor G♯ (G♯5), with a natural tessitura within the upper fourth octave.[269][270] Tesfaye often makes use of his head voice to build resonance to belt out strong high notes within the fifth octave.[270] Tesfaye's vocals have a recognizable Ethiopian characteristic. Hannah Giogis of *Pitchfork* notes that \"his trademark vibrato, the characteristically pained whine that pervades much of Tesfaye's music, draws from a long Ethiopian musical legacy of tortured pining. Imbuing our voices with the shaky pain of loss—romantic or otherwise—is a hallmark of Ethiopian musical tradition. Tesfaye, with his staccato wails and aching nostalgia, is a young, North American addition to a dynasty of melodramatic Ethiopian singers.\"[271] In 2023, *Rolling Stone* ranked the Weeknd at number 110 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[272]\n\n\nTesfaye's discography spans pop, R&B, hip hop, dance, alternative, and new wave genres.[273] His work is generally categorized as alternative R&B, due to his contributions in broadening the genre's musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles.[274][69] Mistry writes that he \"will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&B music—because Tesfaye is a black singer, not because he's making quantifiable, canonical R&B.\"[23] Tesfaye shared his thoughts on the primary label during an interview with *Time* in 2015, stating: \"Alternative R&B is in my soul. It's not going anywhere. When I put out songs from *House of Balloons* in 2010, people said I made R&B cool again. I'm assuming that's when the label was created. I feel honored that a good part of today's music is inspired by it, consciously or subconsciously. The only way I could have done that was to be ambitious and grand.\"[275] Tesfaye's first three mixtapes; *House of Balloons*, *Thursday* and *Echoes of Silence*, are alternative R&B projects that draw on dream pop, post-punk and trip hop, amongst others.[276][277] His debut studio album *Kiss Land* is categorized as R&B and dark wave.[278] His next three albums, *Beauty Behind the Madness*, *Starboy* and *After Hours*, are considered R&B and pop; with *Starboy* utilizing heavy trap influences,[279][280] and *After Hours* drawing on new wave and dream pop influences.[281][282] Tesfaye's fifth studio album *Dawn FM* explores dance-pop and synth-pop genres.[283][284]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Plagiarism allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2015, Tesfaye was sued by Cutting Edge Music, which alleged that the bassline for \"The Hills\" had been taken from a composition featured in the score for the 2013 science fiction film *The Machine*.[285] One of the producers of the song was alleged to have sent a private Twitter message to Tom Raybould, the composer of the film's score, to tell him about the sample.[286] In September 2018, Tesfaye and Daft Punk were sued for allegedly stealing the rhythm for \"Starboy\" from Ethiopian poet and singer-songwriter Yasminah.[287] Tesfaye denied the allegations.[288]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Tesfaye was sued by British trio William Smith, Brian Clover, and Scott McCulloch, who accused Tesfaye of copyright infringement from plagiarising their song \"I Need to Love\" in order to create his song \"A Lonely Night\". They sought $150,000 from Tesfaye and Belly. In August 2019, the lawsuit was dismissed via summary judgment with the option to amend, with the court ruling that they had failed to show that Tesfaye or anyone else involved in making \"A Lonely Night\" had access to their song or that the works were substantially similar.[289] In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended claim based on secondary infringement, which is still in litigation.[290][291]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Tesfaye and Kendrick Lamar were sued by the now-defunct indie band Yeasayer, claiming that \"Pray for Me\" includes an unauthorized sample of their song \"Sunrise\".[292] Later that year, Yeasayer voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit.[293] In September 2021, Tesfaye, Nicolás Jaar, and Frank Dukes were sued for copyright infringement by producers Suniel Fox and Henry Strange, protesting that \"Call Out My Name\" is \"strikingly [or] substantially similar, if not identical\" to their 2015 track \"Vibeking\".[294][295]\n\n\n\n### Allegations of homophobic lyrics[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Tesfaye was criticized for some of the lyrics in his and Gesaffelstein's single \"Lost in the Fire\". The second verse of the song, with the lines \"You said you might be into girls, said you're going through a phase / Keeping your heart safe / Well, baby, you can bring a friend / She can ride on top your face / While I fuck you straight\", were accused of being homophobic, fetishizing bisexuality, and perpetuating the falsehood that a person who identifies as being part of the LGBTQ+ community can be \"turned straight\".[296][297] Tesfaye subtly addressed the controversy in the song \"Snowchild\" from *After Hours*, with the lines \"Every month another accusation / Only thing I'm phobic of is failing\".[298][299]\n\n\n\n### *The Idol* allegations[edit]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2023, *Rolling Stone* released a lengthy exposé on the working conditions and set life of the HBO drama series *The Idol*, a series in which Tesfaye stars, co-created and co-wrote alongside Sam Levinson. The series received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of sexual content which critics labeled \"torture porn\". The series was originally directed by Amy Seimetz who suddenly \"exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished\". The series then overwent a major creative overhaul. It was reported that Tesfaye felt the show had too much of a \"female perspective\". Over 14 crew members alleged a toxic work environment with one adding \"What I signed up for was a dark satire of fame and the fame model in the 21st century...\" however, \"It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing.\" Sources alleged that Seimetz’s approach to the story was scrapped and the show became \"like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show — and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better\".[300]\n\n\nIn response to the allegations, Tesfaye mocked the reporting on his Twitter account, posting a clip of the characters in the show discussing the magazine saying, \"*Rolling Stone*? Aren't they a little irrelevant?\". Tesfaye posted the comment in the caption: \"@*Rolling Stone* did we upset you?\".[301][302] Tesfaye's response received widespread criticism.[303] In an interview with *Vanity Fair*, he continued to dismiss the reporting, saying that logistical difficulties with Seimetz's schedule and production timelines, as well as a desire not to rush his first show, propelled the overhaul.[304]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye is a cinephile, and has made numerous movie references in his music videos and teasers.[305][306] On August 30, 2019, during the Telluride Film Festival, he made his acting debut in the film *Uncut Gems*.[307]\n\n\nOn March 7, 2020, during his third appearance as a musical guest on *Saturday Night Live*, he starred in the skit \"On The Couch\" with actors Kenan Thompson and Chris Redd.[308] On May 4, he co-wrote and starred in an episode of *American Dad!.*[309] In July, he voiced three characters during the 200th episode of *Robot Chicken*.[310]\n\n\nOn June 29, 2021, Tesfaye announced that he would be co-creating, co-writing, executive producing and starring in the HBO television drama series *The Idol*, alongside his producing partner Reza Fahim and *Euphoria* creator Sam Levinson.[311] On March 20, 2022, Tesfaye voiced two characters during an episode of *The Simpsons*.[312]\n\n\nIn 2023, it was announced that Tesfaye is co-writing a film with Trey Edward Shults, who is attached to direct; Tesfaye is also set to star in the film, alongside Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan.[313][314]\n\n\n\n### Business[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Tesfaye collaborated with condom company ONE to give away limited-edition condoms at his shows during the Kiss Land Fall Tour.[315][316] In November 2015, he partnered with electronic vaporizer company Pax Labs to release a limited edition vaporizer.[317][318] He also collaborated with fashion designer Alexander Wang for an apparel collection.[319] In 2016, Tesfaye became a creative collaborator and global brand ambassador for the clothing brand Puma.[320] With the partnership, he released numerous capsule collections and hosted several pop-up retail stores.[321][322]\n\n\nIn 2017, Tesfaye partnered with retail company H&M for their men's collection.[323] He cut ties with the company in 2018, following a racist incident within the company.[324] In July 2018, Tesfaye collaborated with Marvel Comics to release a comic book inspired by his third studio album *Starboy*.[325] In August, he released an apparel collection in collaboration with A Bathing Ape.[326][327] A second collection was released in January 2020.[328]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Tesfaye became an owner and global ambassador of the esports company OverActive Media, who owns the Splyce and Overwatch League team Toronto Defiant.[329]\n\n\nOn August 31, 2020, Tesfaye partnered with TD Bank to launch Black HXOUSE, an entrepreneurial initiative within the incubator HXOUSE, where he serves as a sleeping partner.[330] On September 9, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a CA$221,000,000 joint venture with HXOUSE for Black Canadian entrepreneurs.[331]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Tesfaye auctioned a collection of visual artwork and an unreleased song in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) on Nifty Gateway.[332][333] In October, he joined football player Tom Brady's NFT platform Autograph as a member of their board of directors.[334]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nAfter being presented with a Bikila Award for Professional Excellence in 2014, Tesfaye donated CA$50,000 to the University of Toronto to fund a new course on Ge'ez, the classic language of Ethiopia.[335] In May 2016, during Orthodox Easter, Tesfaye donated CA$50,000 to the St. Mary Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in Toronto, Canada, a church he attended growing up.[336][337] In August 2016, he funded a new Ethiopian studies program at the University of Toronto.[338]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Tesfaye donated US$100,000 to the Suubi Health Center, a maternity and children's medical facility in Budondo, Uganda. He was inspired to support the center after learning of French Montana's work with Global Citizen and Mama Hope to help raise awareness for Suubi and the people of Uganda.[339]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Tesfaye launched a line of non-medical face masks with all of the proceeds going to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund, a campaign launched by the Recording Academy to help musicians affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[340] In addition, Tesfaye donated US$500,000 to MusiCares and CA$500,000 to the Scarborough Health Network.[341]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Tesfaye donated US$250,000 to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation following numerous reports of police brutality in the United States.[342][338][343] In May 2020, in response to the murder of George Floyd and the protests that followed, Tesfaye donated US$500,000 to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp, and the National Bail Out.[344] He then urged other music executives, major record labels, and streaming services to donate to the cause as well.[345][346]\n\n\nOn August 7, 2020, Tesfaye held the \"Weeknd Experience\", an interactive virtual concert on the social media platform TikTok that drew two million total viewers, including 275,000 concurrent viewers.

Through the fund, Tesfaye was to donate US$1 from every ticket sold at his After Hours til Dawn Tour, in addition to a US$500,000 donation, to the WFP.[357]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye is known to be very private, and prefers to keep his personal life out of the public eye.[358][359] In the beginning of his career, he refrained from participating in interviews and instead chose to communicate via Twitter, which he attributed to shyness and insecurities.[360] To this day, he is still adamant about not participating in interviews, only agreeing to be interviewed in rare situations.[361]\n\n\nFrom April 2015 to August 2019, Tesfaye was in an on-again, off-again relationship with American model Bella Hadid.[362][363] She starred in the music video for his single \"In the Night\" in December 2015.[364] He dated American singer-actress Selena Gomez from January to October 2017.[365][366] Both of the relationships received widespread media attention, and were the topic of tabloid speculation.[367][368][369] Since February 2022, Tesfaye has been in a relationship with Palestinian model Simi Khadra.[370]\n\n\nTesfaye's hairstyle, which has been described as one of his most recognizable traits, has been claimed to be partly inspired by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.[24][371] He began growing it out in 2011 and remarked at how easy it was to maintain with \"a hard shampoo every once in a while\".[24] He cut his hair in 2016, prior to the release of *Starboy*.[372] On social media, Tesfaye typically suffixed his first name with \"xo\",[373] which is often used as an emoticon for hugs and kisses.[373] According to *The Guardian*'s Hermione Hoby, this was his intention, though others believe it was a reference to his recreational use of ecstasy and oxycodone.[374][375] He later altered the handles on his social media to reflect his stage name in preparation for the release of *Starboy*.[376]\n\n\nIn January 2015, Tesfaye was arrested for allegedly punching a police officer in Las Vegas after being taken into an elevator to break up a fight.[377][378] He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to complete fifty hours of community service.[379]\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Tesfaye was residing in Bel Air, Los Angeles.[380][381] In 2017, he purchased a home in Hidden Hills, California for $18.5 million, which he sold to Madonna in 2021 for $19.3 million.[382] Tesfaye previously lived in penthouses in Westwood, Los Angeles[383][384] and New York City.[385][386]\n\n\nIn April 2023, Tesfaye revealed in an interview with Interview Magazine that he has attention deficit disorder.[387]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by the Weeknd\n\nTesfaye has won four Grammy Awards, a Latin Grammy Award, twenty *Billboard* Music Awards, six American Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards and twenty-two Juno Awards.[388] He has also received nominations for an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award.[389]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Tesfaye was awarded the Allan Slaight Honour by Canada's Walk of Fame for \"making a positive impact in the fields of music, film, literature, visual or performing arts, sports, innovation or philanthropy\".[390]\n\n\nThe Mayor of Toronto, John Tory, announced that the city would observe February 7, 2021 as \"The Weeknd Day\" to commemorate Tesfaye's Super Bowl halftime performance.[391][392]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: The Weeknd discography and List of songs recorded by the Weeknd\n\n**Studio albums**\n\n\n\n* *Kiss Land* (2013)\n* *Beauty Behind the Madness* (2015)\n* *Starboy* (2016)\n* *After Hours* (2020)\n* *Dawn FM* (2022)\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Weeknd videography\n\n* *Michael Jackson's Journey from Motown to Off the Wall* (2016)\n* *Uncut Gems* (2019)\n* *The Show* (2021)\n* *Live at SoFi Stadium* (2023)\n* *The Idol* (2023)\n* *Untitled Trey Edward Shults film* (TBA)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-streamed artists on Spotify\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n**Headlining**\n\n\n\n* The Fall Tour (2012)\n* The Kiss Land Fall Tour (2013)\n* King of the Fall Tour (2014)\n* The Madness Fall Tour (2015)\n* Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour (2017)\n* The Weeknd Asia Tour (2018)\n* After Hours til Dawn Tour (2022–)\n\n\n**Supporting**\n\n\n\n* Florence and the Machine – Ceremonials Tour (2012)\n* Justin Timberlake – The 20/20 Experience World Tour (2013)\n* Drake – Would You Like a Tour?

Two years later, he co-founded the XO record label and released the mixtapes *House of Balloons*, *Thursday* and *Echoes of Silence*, which gained recognition for his style of contemporary and alternative R&B and the mystique surrounding his identity.[6] In 2012, he signed with Republic Records and rereleased the mixtapes in the compilation album *Trilogy*. He explored dark wave in his debut studio album *Kiss Land* (2013), which debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200. After its release, Tesfaye began contributing to film soundtracks, with his acclaimed single \"Earned It\" from *Fifty Shades of Grey* (2015) winning the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance, while also being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[7]\n\n\nTesfaye earned critical and commercial success with his pop-leaning second album *Beauty Behind the Madness* (2015), which reached number one in the US, contained the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart-topping singles \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills\", and won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album and was nominated for Album of the Year.[8] His trap-infused third album *Starboy* (2016) saw similar commercial success and included the US number-one single of the same name and \"Die for You\", and won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Tesfaye explored new wave and dream pop with his critically-acclaimed fourth studio album *After Hours* (2020), which featured the chart record-setting single \"Blinding Lights\" and the US number-one singles \"Heartless\" and \"Save Your Tears\".[9] Dance-pop inspired his fifth album *Dawn FM* (2022), which included the US top-ten single \"Take My Breath\". In 2023, he co-created and starred in the drama series *The Idol*, which was critically panned.\n\n\nAmong the world's best-selling music artists with over 75 million records sold,[10] Tesfaye holds several streaming and *Billboard* chart records.[11][12] He is the first Canadian artist to earn four diamond-certified singles from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), as well as the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three spots on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[13][14] \"Blinding Lights\" became the most-streamed song in Spotify history and the best-performing song in the *Billboard* Hot 100's history, as well as the longest charting song by a solo artist on the Billboard Hot 100.[15][16] Tesfaye was listed by *Time* as one of the world's most influential people in 2020, and was dubbed the \"world's most popular artist\" by *Guinness World Records* in 2023.[17][18] An advocate for racial equality and food security, he was appointed a World Food Programme Goodwill Ambassador in 2021.[19][20]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAbel Makkonen Tesfaye[a] was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario.[21] He is the only child of Ethiopian immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu,[b] who separated shortly after his birth.[23][24] He was brought up in the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother.[21][25] He has an estranged relationship with his father, telling *Rolling Stone* in 2015 that \"I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived — I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there.\"[24]\n\n\nTesfaye was raised as an Ethiopian Orthodox.[24][26] When asked whether or not he was still religious, he stated to *Variety* in 2020, \"I dunno...everything is a test, and if you are religious or spiritual, you have to go through things.\"[27] His native language is Amharic, which he learned through his grandmother.[28] He later became fluent in French by attending a French-immersion school.[29] He was further educated at West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute.[30]\n\n\nWhen he was 17, Tesfaye dropped out of school and moved to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with two friends; including his best friend and now creative director La Mar Taylor.[31] He has described this period as being like the 1995 film *Kids* \"without the AIDS\", as they lived a hedonistic lifestyle.[21][32] He has also experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to \"smarten up, to focus.\"[33][34]\n\n\nTesfaye often used drugs and abused illegal substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and cough syrup.[35] In December 2016, he stated that drugs were a \"crutch\" for him when it came to writing music.[36] In August 2021, during a cover story with *GQ*, he described himself as being \"sober lite\", meaning that he has stopped using drugs with the exception of marijuana. He also noted that he drinks alcohol occasionally, stating: \"I'm not a heavy drinker, as much as I used to be. The romance of drinking isn't there.\"[37]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2009–2011: Early beginnings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: House of Balloons, Thursday (album), and Echoes of Silence\n\nIn August 2009, Tesfaye began anonymously releasing music on YouTube.[38][39] The following year, he met Jeremy Rose, a producer who had an idea for a dark contemporary R&B project. After initially trying to pitch the idea to musician Curtis Santiago, Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who freestyle rapped over it. Rose produced three songs – \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\" and \"The Party & The After Party\" – and others that Tesfaye had sung on, which were ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would be credited for them.[40] In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\" and \"The Morning\" to YouTube under the username \"xoxxxoooxo\".[41][42] His identity was initially unknown. The songs drew some attention online, and were later included in a blog post from rapper Drake.[40][43] The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including *Pitchfork* and *The New York Times*.[44]\n\n\nBefore adopting the stage name the Weeknd, Tesfaye released music under the aliases the Noise and Kin Kane.[24] His current stage name was chosen in tribute to when he dropped out of school, took his mattress, \"left one weekend and never came home.\" However, Rose claims the name was his idea.[26][45] The last 'e' was excluded to avoid trademark problems with pop rock band the Weekend.[46] In the beginning of his career, Tesfaye worked at American Apparel. Due to his anonymity, his co-workers listened to his music without knowing it was him.[47][48][49]\n\n\nIn 2011, Tesfaye met music executives Wassim \"Sal\" Slaiby and Amir \"Cash\" Esmailian, with whom, along with Taylor, he founded the XO record label.[50] On March 21, Tesfaye released his debut mixtape *House of Balloons*.[51][52][53] The mixtape included production from producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, and included the tracks produced by Rose, although he did not receive production credits.[40] *House of Balloons* was named as one of ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.[54] On August 18, Tesfaye released his second mixtape *Thursday*, which received generally positive reviews.[55] His third mixtape, *Echoes of Silence*, was released on December 21.

Kelly as his main musical inspirations.[249] He has attributed Jackson's music as key in spurring him to be a singer, referencing the lyrics to \"Dirty Diana\" as an example.[24] His high-flying vocal style was influenced by Ethiopian singers such as Aster Aweke.[24] He grew up listening to a variety of music genres, including soul, hip hop, funk, indie rock, and post-punk.[250] Tesfaye is heavily influenced by 1980s music, and credits the video game *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City* (2002) for \"opening my eyes\" to the music of that era.[251] \"I've always had an admiration for the era before I was born\", he said in an interview for *Billboard*. \"You can hear it as far back as my first mixtape that the '80s – Siouxsie and the Banshees, Cocteau Twins – play such a huge role in my sound.\"[252]\n\n\nTesfaye has named Deftones as one of his influences during the making of *House of Balloons*, *Thursday* and *Echoes of Silence*.[253] He has also cited Lana Del Rey,[254] David Bowie,[255] the Smiths, Bad Brains, Talking Heads, DeBarge,[256] 50 Cent, Wu-Tang Clan,[257][258] and Eminem as influences and inspirations.[259][260] When Daft Punk announced their split in 2021, Tesfaye praised them during an interview with *Variety*, saying: \"Those guys are one of the reasons I make music, so I can't even compare them to other people...\"[261]\n\n\n\n### Production and songwriting[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye's songs are \"built around a fogged, crepuscular production\",[262] and feature slow tempos,[263] rumbling bass, and forlorn echoes.[23] His music incorporates samples that are unconventional in R&B production, including punk, shoegaze, dream pop and alternative rock.[264] Marc Hogan of *Spin* says that Tesfaye's samples tend \"to draw from rock critic-approved sources, though generally ones that already share elements of his sexual menace\", sampling artists such as Beach House, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Aaliyah.[265] Tesfaye worked mostly with producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, whom Ian Cohen of *Pitchfork* credits with developing \"a state-of-the-art R&B template\" with the artist.[263] In concert, Tesfaye reappropriates his digitized productions with a suite-like arena rock aesthetic.[23]\n\n\nHis emotional, plaintive lyrics often express feelings of hurt and deal with subject matter such as sex,[262] drugs, and partying; this is seen especially in *After Hours* and *House of Balloons*.[23] Hermione Hoby of *The Guardian* characterizes Tesfaye's songs as \"narcotised-slow jams\" and delineates their message as \"partying is an existential experience, sex is fraught with alienation, and everything registers as unreal and unsettling.\"[262] Paul MacInnes of *The Guardian* stated that he views Tesfaye's three mixtapes as \"a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover.\"[266] Anupa Mistry of the *Toronto Standard* observes throughout his mixtapes a \"cast of supine, stoned zombie-women... whose legs willingly part after being plied with substances and who morph into threats only when [he is] coming down and feeling vulnerable.\"[23] Tesfaye has stated that by singing vulgar, ignorant lyrics in an elegant, sexy way, he is \"paying homage to R Kelly, and even Prince to a certain extent.\"[267]\n\n\n\n### Voice and music style[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye often sings in a falsetto register,[268] exhibiting an enticing tone. J. D. Considine finds his singing's \"tremulous quality\" similar to Michael Jackson, but writes that he eschews Jackson's \"strong basis in the blues\" for a more Arabic-influenced melisma.[264] Tesfaye possesses a wide light-lyric tenor vocal range, which spans over three octaves. His vocal range reaches its extreme low at the bass F (F2), and its peak high at the tenor G♯ (G♯5), with a natural tessitura within the upper fourth octave.[269][270] Tesfaye often makes use of his head voice to build resonance to belt out strong high notes within the fifth octave.[270] Tesfaye's vocals have a recognizable Ethiopian characteristic. Hannah Giogis of *Pitchfork* notes that \"his trademark vibrato, the characteristically pained whine that pervades much of Tesfaye's music, draws from a long Ethiopian musical legacy of tortured pining. Imbuing our voices with the shaky pain of loss—romantic or otherwise—is a hallmark of Ethiopian musical tradition. Tesfaye, with his staccato wails and aching nostalgia, is a young, North American addition to a dynasty of melodramatic Ethiopian singers.\"[271] In 2023, *Rolling Stone* ranked the Weeknd at number 110 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[272]\n\n\nTesfaye's discography spans pop, R&B, hip hop, dance, alternative, and new wave genres.[273] His work is generally categorized as alternative R&B, due to his contributions in broadening the genre's musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles.[274][69] Mistry writes that he \"will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&B music—because Tesfaye is a black singer, not because he's making quantifiable, canonical R&B.\"[23] Tesfaye shared his thoughts on the primary label during an interview with *Time* in 2015, stating: \"Alternative R&B is in my soul. It's not going anywhere. When I put out songs from *House of Balloons* in 2010, people said I made R&B cool again. I'm assuming that's when the label was created. I feel honored that a good part of today's music is inspired by it, consciously or subconsciously. The only way I could have done that was to be ambitious and grand.\"[275] Tesfaye's first three mixtapes; *House of Balloons*, *Thursday* and *Echoes of Silence*, are alternative R&B projects that draw on dream pop, post-punk and trip hop, amongst others.[276][277] His debut studio album *Kiss Land* is categorized as R&B and dark wave.[278] His next three albums, *Beauty Behind the Madness*, *Starboy* and *After Hours*, are considered R&B and pop; with *Starboy* utilizing heavy trap influences,[279][280] and *After Hours* drawing on new wave and dream pop influences.[281][282] Tesfaye's fifth studio album *Dawn FM* explores dance-pop and synth-pop genres.[283][284]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Plagiarism allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2015, Tesfaye was sued by Cutting Edge Music, which alleged that the bassline for \"The Hills\" had been taken from a composition featured in the score for the 2013 science fiction film *The Machine*.[285] One of the producers of the song was alleged to have sent a private Twitter message to Tom Raybould, the composer of the film's score, to tell him about the sample.[286] In September 2018, Tesfaye and Daft Punk were sued for allegedly stealing the rhythm for \"Starboy\" from Ethiopian poet and singer-songwriter Yasminah.[287] Tesfaye denied the allegations.[288]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Tesfaye was sued by British trio William Smith, Brian Clover, and Scott McCulloch, who accused Tesfaye of copyright infringement from plagiarising their song \"I Need to Love\" in order to create his song \"A Lonely Night\". They sought $150,000 from Tesfaye and Belly. In August 2019, the lawsuit was dismissed via summary judgment with the option to amend, with the court ruling that they had failed to show that Tesfaye or anyone else involved in making \"A Lonely Night\" had access to their song or that the works were substantially similar.[289] In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended claim based on secondary infringement, which is still in litigation.[290][291]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Tesfaye and Kendrick Lamar were sued by the now-defunct indie band Yeasayer, claiming that \"Pray for Me\" includes an unauthorized sample of their song \"Sunrise\".[292] Later that year, Yeasayer voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit.[293] In September 2021, Tesfaye, Nicolás Jaar, and Frank Dukes were sued for copyright infringement by producers Suniel Fox and Henry Strange, protesting that \"Call Out My Name\" is \"strikingly [or] substantially similar, if not identical\" to their 2015 track \"Vibeking\".[294][295]\n\n\n\n### Allegations of homophobic lyrics[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Tesfaye was criticized for some of the lyrics in his and Gesaffelstein's single \"Lost in the Fire\". The second verse of the song, with the lines \"You said you might be into girls, said you're going through a phase / Keeping your heart safe / Well, baby, you can bring a friend / She can ride on top your face / While I fuck you straight\", were accused of being homophobic, fetishizing bisexuality, and perpetuating the falsehood that a person who identifies as being part of the LGBTQ+ community can be \"turned straight\".[296][297] Tesfaye subtly addressed the controversy in the song \"Snowchild\" from *After Hours*, with the lines \"Every month another accusation / Only thing I'm phobic of is failing\".[298][299]\n\n\n\n### *The Idol* allegations[edit]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2023, *Rolling Stone* released a lengthy exposé on the working conditions and set life of the HBO drama series *The Idol*, a series in which Tesfaye stars, co-created and co-wrote alongside Sam Levinson. The series received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of sexual content which critics labeled \"torture porn\". The series was originally directed by Amy Seimetz who suddenly \"exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished\". The series then overwent a major creative overhaul. It was reported that Tesfaye felt the show had too much of a \"female perspective\". Over 14 crew members alleged a toxic work environment with one adding \"What I signed up for was a dark satire of fame and the fame model in the 21st century...\" however, \"It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing.\" Sources alleged that Seimetz’s approach to the story was scrapped and the show became \"like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show — and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better\".[300]\n\n\nIn response to the allegations, Tesfaye mocked the reporting on his Twitter account, posting a clip of the characters in the show discussing the magazine saying, \"*Rolling Stone*? Aren't they a little irrelevant?\". Tesfaye posted the comment in the caption: \"@*Rolling Stone* did we upset you?\".[301][302] Tesfaye's response received widespread criticism.[303] In an interview with *Vanity Fair*, he continued to dismiss the reporting, saying that logistical difficulties with Seimetz's schedule and production timelines, as well as a desire not to rush his first show, propelled the overhaul.[304]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye is a cinephile, and has made numerous movie references in his music videos and teasers.[305][306] On August 30, 2019, during the Telluride Film Festival, he made his acting debut in the film *Uncut Gems*.[307]\n\n\nOn March 7, 2020, during his third appearance as a musical guest on *Saturday Night Live*, he starred in the skit \"On The Couch\" with actors Kenan Thompson and Chris Redd.[308] On May 4, he co-wrote and starred in an episode of *American Dad!.*[309] In July, he voiced three characters during the 200th episode of *Robot Chicken*.[310]\n\n\nOn June 29, 2021, Tesfaye announced that he would be co-creating, co-writing, executive producing and starring in the HBO television drama series *The Idol*, alongside his producing partner Reza Fahim and *Euphoria* creator Sam Levinson.[311] On March 20, 2022, Tesfaye voiced two characters during an episode of *The Simpsons*.[312]\n\n\nIn 2023, it was announced that Tesfaye is co-writing a film with Trey Edward Shults, who is attached to direct; Tesfaye is also set to star in the film, alongside Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan.[313][314]\n\n\n\n### Business[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Tesfaye collaborated with condom company ONE to give away limited-edition condoms at his shows during the Kiss Land Fall Tour.[315][316] In November 2015, he partnered with electronic vaporizer company Pax Labs to release a limited edition vaporizer.[317][318] He also collaborated with fashion designer Alexander Wang for an apparel collection.[319] In 2016, Tesfaye became a creative collaborator and global brand ambassador for the clothing brand Puma.[320] With the partnership, he released numerous capsule collections and hosted several pop-up retail stores.[321][322]\n\n\nIn 2017, Tesfaye partnered with retail company H&M for their men's collection.[323] He cut ties with the company in 2018, following a racist incident within the company.[324] In July 2018, Tesfaye collaborated with Marvel Comics to release a comic book inspired by his third studio album *Starboy*.[325] In August, he released an apparel collection in collaboration with A Bathing Ape.[326][327] A second collection was released in January 2020.[328]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Tesfaye became an owner and global ambassador of the esports company OverActive Media, who owns the Splyce and Overwatch League team Toronto Defiant.[329]\n\n\nOn August 31, 2020, Tesfaye partnered with TD Bank to launch Black HXOUSE, an entrepreneurial initiative within the incubator HXOUSE, where he serves as a sleeping partner.[330] On September 9, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a CA$221,000,000 joint venture with HXOUSE for Black Canadian entrepreneurs.[331]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Tesfaye auctioned a collection of visual artwork and an unreleased song in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) on Nifty Gateway.[332][333] In October, he joined football player Tom Brady's NFT platform Autograph as a member of their board of directors.[334]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nAfter being presented with a Bikila Award for Professional Excellence in 2014, Tesfaye donated CA$50,000 to the University of Toronto to fund a new course on Ge'ez, the classic language of Ethiopia.[335] In May 2016, during Orthodox Easter, Tesfaye donated CA$50,000 to the St. Mary Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in Toronto, Canada, a church he attended growing up.[336][337] In August 2016, he funded a new Ethiopian studies program at the University of Toronto.[338]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Tesfaye donated US$100,000 to the Suubi Health Center, a maternity and children's medical facility in Budondo, Uganda. He was inspired to support the center after learning of French Montana's work with Global Citizen and Mama Hope to help raise awareness for Suubi and the people of Uganda.[339]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Tesfaye launched a line of non-medical face masks with all of the proceeds going to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund, a campaign launched by the Recording Academy to help musicians affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[340] In addition, Tesfaye donated US$500,000 to MusiCares and CA$500,000 to the Scarborough Health Network.[341]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Tesfaye donated US$250,000 to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation following numerous reports of police brutality in the United States.[342][338][343] In May 2020, in response to the murder of George Floyd and the protests that followed, Tesfaye donated US$500,000 to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp, and the National Bail Out.[344] He then urged other music executives, major record labels, and streaming services to donate to the cause as well.[345][346]\n\n\nOn August 7, 2020, Tesfaye held the \"Weeknd Experience\", an interactive virtual concert on the social media platform TikTok that drew two million total viewers, including 275,000 concurrent viewers. The concert raised over US$350,000 for the Equal Justice Initiative. He also donated US$300,000 to Global Aid for Lebanon in support of victims of the Beirut explosion.[347][348] On November 2, the University of Toronto announced that it was able to reach and surpass its fundraising goal of CA$500,000 for its Ethiopic program, which included a CA$30,000 donation from Tesfaye.[349] In May 2021, he was among the celebrities expressing more solidarity for civilians who died during the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis.[350][351] On September 23, Tesfaye was honored with the Quincy Jones Humanitarian Award at the inaugural Music in Action Awards, presented by the Black Music Action Coalition.[352]\n\n\n\n### WFP ambassadorship[edit]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2021, Tesfaye announced a US$1,000,000 donation through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to relief efforts in Ethiopia for people affected by the Tigray War.[353] On June 9, he met with the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, Samantha Power, to discuss the humanitarian crisis of the Tigray War.[354] Tesfaye was appointed as a UN Goodwill Ambassador for the World Food Programme on October 7.[355][356] On March 3, 2022, he partnered with the WFP to launch the XO Humanitarian Fund. Through the fund, Tesfaye was to donate US$1 from every ticket sold at his After Hours til Dawn Tour, in addition to a US$500,000 donation, to the WFP.[357]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nTesfaye is known to be very private, and prefers to keep his personal life out of the public eye.[358][359] In the beginning of his career, he refrained from participating in interviews and instead chose to communicate via Twitter, which he attributed to shyness and insecurities.[360] To this day, he is still adamant about not participating in interviews, only agreeing to be interviewed in rare situations.[361]\n\n\nFrom April 2015 to August 2019, Tesfaye was in an on-again, off-again relationship with American model Bella Hadid.[362][363] She starred in the music video for his single \"In the Night\" in December 2015.[364] He dated American singer-actress Selena Gomez from January to October 2017.[365][366] Both of the relationships received widespread media attention, and were the topic of tabloid speculation.[367][368][369] Since February 2022, Tesfaye has been in a relationship with Palestinian model Simi Khadra.[370]\n\n\nTesfaye's hairstyle, which has been described as one of his most recognizable traits, has been claimed to be partly inspired by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.[24][371] He began growing it out in 2011 and remarked at how easy it was to maintain with \"a hard shampoo every once in a while\".[24] He cut his hair in 2016, prior to the release of *Starboy*.[372] On social media, Tesfaye typically suffixed his first name with \"xo\",[373] which is often used as an emoticon for hugs and kisses.[373] According to *The Guardian*'s Hermione Hoby, this was his intention, though others believe it was a reference to his recreational use of ecstasy and oxycodone.[374][375] He later altered the handles on his social media to reflect his stage name in preparation for the release of *Starboy*.[376]\n\n\nIn January 2015, Tesfaye was arrested for allegedly punching a police officer in Las Vegas after being taken into an elevator to break up a fight.[377][378] He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to complete fifty hours of community service.[379]\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Tesfaye was residing in Bel Air, Los Angeles.[380][381] In 2017, he purchased a home in Hidden Hills, California for $18.5 million, which he sold to Madonna in 2021 for $19.3 million.[382] Tesfaye previously lived in penthouses in Westwood, Los Angeles[383][384] and New York City.[385][386]\n\n\nIn April 2023, Tesfaye revealed in an interview with Interview Magazine that he has attention deficit disorder.[387]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by the Weeknd\n\nTesfaye has won four Grammy Awards, a Latin Grammy Award, twenty *Billboard* Music Awards, six American Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards and twenty-two Juno Awards.[388] He has also received nominations for an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award.[389]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Tesfaye was awarded the Allan Slaight Honour by Canada's Walk of Fame for \"making a positive impact in the fields of music, film, literature, visual or performing arts, sports, innovation or philanthropy\".[390]\n\n\nThe Mayor of Toronto, John Tory, announced that the city would observe February 7, 2021 as \"The Weeknd Day\" to commemorate Tesfaye's Super Bowl halftime performance.[391][392]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: The Weeknd discography and List of songs recorded by the Weeknd\n\n**Studio albums**\n\n\n\n* *Kiss Land* (2013)\n* *Beauty Behind the Madness* (2015)\n* *Starboy* (2016)\n* *After Hours* (2020)\n* *Dawn FM* (2022)\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Weeknd videography\n\n* *Michael Jackson's Journey from Motown to Off the Wall* (2016)\n* *Uncut Gems* (2019)\n* *The Show* (2021)\n* *Live at SoFi Stadium* (2023)\n* *The Idol* (2023)\n* *Untitled Trey Edward Shults film* (TBA)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-streamed artists on Spotify\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n**Headlining**\n\n\n\n* The Fall Tour (2012)\n* The Kiss Land Fall Tour (2013)\n* King of the Fall Tour (2014)\n* The Madness Fall Tour (2015)\n* Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour (2017)\n* The Weeknd Asia Tour (2018)\n* After Hours til Dawn Tour (2022–)\n\n\n**Supporting**\n\n\n\n* Florence and the Machine – Ceremonials Tour (2012)\n* Justin Timberlake – The 20/20 Experience World Tour (2013)\n* Drake – Would You Like a Tour?

I liked to be at home with my family.\"[24]\n\n\nAs a child, he attended church weekly with his devoutly Catholic mother and sang in the church choir until age 13. After leaving the choir, he developed an interest in the artists he heard on the radio, particularly Daddy Yankee and Héctor Lavoe.[21] His stage name originally came from a time in which he was forced to wear a bunny costume and was angry about it.[22]\n\n\nSpeaking about the Puerto Rican music industry, he stated, \"I'm from Vega Baja, a small area that's not a metropolis like San Juan where the majority of the genre's artists have come from.\"[25]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–2017: Early career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nHe started to write and create his own interpretations at the age of 14,[26] until, in 2013, he began to publish his songs through SoundCloud, including \"Get\" in 2013, \"Tentación\" in 2014, \"Just let me know\" in 2015, among others.[27] In 2016, his song \"Diles\" caught the attention of DJ Luian from SoundCloud who signed him to his record label, Hear this Music.[5][28][29][30][31] His single \"Soy Peor\" reached number 19 on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[32] Bad Bunny's May 2017 collaboration with Karol G, \"Ahora Me Llama\", reached number 10 on the *Billboard* Hot Latin Songs chart.[33][34] It was listed on \"Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs Of 2017\" as one of the best Latin songs of 2017.[34]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Bad Bunny signed a booking deal with Cardenas Marketing Network (CMN) for several Latin American countries.[35] Starting in November 2017, Bad Bunny hosted Beats 1's first Spanish-language show, *Trap Kingz*.[36][37] The remix of \"Te Boté\" with Ozuna and Nicky Jam reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[38]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: Major breakthrough, *X 100pre*, and *Oasis*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *X100pre* and *Oasis*\n\n![](image)Bad Bunny performing in Ecuador in September 2018\nIn May 2018, American rapper Cardi B released a collaboration with Bad Bunny and J Balvin, \"I Like It\".[37][39] On October 11, 2018, Bad Bunny released \"Mia\" with Drake,[40][41] which reached number five on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[42]\n\n\nBad Bunny released his debut album *X 100pre* on December 24, 2018, on Christmas Eve 2018 on Rimas Entertainment.[43] At Metacritic, *X 100pre* received an average score of 84 based on five reviews.[44][45] Alexis Petridis of *The Guardian* praised Bad Bunny's \"off-kilter creativity\".[45]\n\n\nIn 2020, *X 100pre* was voted 447th in *Rolling Stone'*s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[46]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2019, Bad Bunny released *Oasis*, an eight-song collaborative album with J Balvin.[47] It peaked at number nine on the *Billboard* Hot 100[48] and topped the *Billboard* US Latin Albums chart.[49] In July 2019, he joined protests against governor Ricardo Rosselló.[50] Bad Bunny and Residente released \"*Afilando Los Cuchillos*\" (\"Sharpening the knives\") during the demonstrations.[51]\n\n\n\n### 2020–2021: *YHLQMDLG*, *Las que no iban a salir*, and *El Último Tour Del Mundo*[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Bad Bunny was a guest performer at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, headlined by Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.[52] Bad Bunny announced the album *YHLQMDLG* on February 27, 2020, during an appearance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* and stated that it would be released on Leap Day 2020, namely February 29.[53][54] The album's title stands for \"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana\" (Spanish for \"I Do What I Want\") and features collaborations with Daddy Yankee, Yaviah, Jowell & Randy, Ñengo Flow, among other artist.[54][55]\n\n\n*YHLQMDLG* debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200, becoming the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the chart at the time.[56] The album was met with critical acclaim, with the album's musical diversity being praised.[57] \"Vete\" was released as the lead single of the album on November 22, 2019.[58] The second single, \"Ignorantes\", with Panamanian singer Sech came out on February 14, 2020.[59][53] In March 2020, Bad Bunny released the music video for \"Yo Perreo Sola\", in which the artist performs in drag.[60] \"Yo Perreo Sola\" landed number one on the *Billboard* Latin Airplay chart, earning Bad Bunny his ninth No.1 on the chart in just over two years.[61]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2020, he released the song \"En Casita\" on SoundCloud, which expressed solidarity towards others in quarantine due to COVID-19 and featured vocals from his girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri.[62] On May 10, 2020, Bad Bunny released his first compilation *Las que no iban a salir*, without previous announcements.[63] The compilation's title translates to \"The Ones that Were Not Going to Come Out\" and it contains previously unreleased or unfinished songs.[64] The album features collaborations with Don Omar, Yandel, Zion & Lennox, Nicky Jam, and Jhay Cortez.[63] Discussing the album's surprise release, Bad Bunny explained, \"There was no real meaning behind it.

The film was originally set to be released on January 12, 2024,[95] prior to being removed from the release schedule.[96] On May 6, 2022, Bad Bunny released his fourth (fifth overall) studio album *Un Verano Sin Ti* which it became commercially successful as it debuted at number one on the *Billboard* 200 and stood there for thirteen non-consecutive weeks.[97][98]\n\n\nBad Bunny began his fourth concert tour World's Hottest Tour on August 5, 2022, set to visit fourteen countries of the American continent.[99] On October 4, 2022, the tour became the highest-grossing tour by a Latin artist in history, earning US$232.5 million at the time.[100] Bad Bunny received the most nominations (eight) for the 2022 American Music Awards, including his first for artist of the year.[101]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2023, Bad Bunny released his first solo single of the year titled \"Where She Goes\", in which he ventured into jersey club music. The music video had cameos from Frank Ocean, Lil Uzi Vert, Ronaldinho, and others.[102]\n\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair on September 12, 2023, Bad Bunny revealed that he is no longer involved in the upcoming El Muerto film after its schedule removal. He has also confirmed that he is working on a new album that is planned to come out sometime during the fall, Bad Bunny hinted at the possibility of the upcoming project's sound, confirming that he is “playing around and enjoying myself, letting go. I’m being inspired a lot by the music of the ’70s, —across genres, in both Spanish and English, but I’m not sure if this is going to shape my music, generally or just one song,”[103] After weeks of unconfirmed teasers and rumors, Bad Bunny revealed the album's title *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*, which has 22 tracks and was released on October 13, 2023.[104]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style and influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Soy Peor\" (2016)\n\n\nBad Bunny's breakthrough hit, the song exemplifies the artist's fast-paced vocal style and his Latin trap influences.\n\n\n---\n\n\"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" (2020)\n\n\nThe song \"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" from his album *YHLQMDLG* samples the bossa nova standard \"The Girl from Ipanema\" by Antônio Carlos Jobim[105] and features Bad Bunny alternating between rapping and singing.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing these files? See media help.*\n\nBad Bunny is considered to be primarily a Latin trap and reggaeton artist.[5][6][8][7] As described in a *Rolling Stone* article, Bad Bunny sings and raps with a \"conversational tone\", employing \"a low, slurry tone, viscous melodies, and a rapper's cadence.\"[25] Throughout the years, Bad Bunny has listed his influences with a wide variety of artists from multiple genres such as Héctor Lavoe, Vico C, Romeo Santos, Juan Luis Guerra, Elvis Crespo, Ricky Martin, Juan Gabriel, Don Omar, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Tego Calderón, Wisin & Yandel, Calle 13, Víctor Manuelle, and Marc Anthony, amongst many others. He considers himself to be a \"music fanatic\" which is the reason why he's inspired by so many people.[1][8][3][106][107][108][109] During an episode of *Behind the Music*, he talked about Ricky Martin's legacy for Latin music and Latin artists, and how Martin changed the music landscape for future Latin artists.[107][110][111] In the music video for Neverita, Bad Bunny paid homage to the Suavemente music video by Puerto Rican artist Elvis Crespo, leaving a message in the end translated from Spanish as \"In honor of the best video of all time\". Elvis Crespo later felt honored by his tribute and ended up doing a merengue version of the song himself in which he performed at the 2022 Latin Billboard Music Awards.[112][108][113]\n\n\nAlthough primarily considered to be a Latin trap and reggaeton artist, his music also incorporates various other elements from other genres such as pop, hip-hop, rock, electronic, reggae, dancehall, latin, soul, and R&B.[5][6][8][7][3] Some publications have credited him for bringing Latin trap into the mainstream in the English-language music market.[114][115][3]\n\n\nAccording to Timothy Monger of AllMusic, his lyrics \"range from humor and pathos to heartbreak and anger (sometimes in the same song).\"[5] According to *Paper*, other themes explored in Bad Bunny's music include \"self-love, inclusivity, and LGBTQ acceptance\".[116]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nVanessa Rosales of CNN has opined that \"in pink, florals and short shorts, Bad Bunny champions a new masculinity\".[117]\n\n\nHe has appeared at award shows with manicured, polished, and long fingernails.[8][118] Ben Beaumont-Thomas of *The Guardian* opined in 2020 that Bunny's style influenced fellow Latin artists, who \"often now share his highly colorful mashup of streetwear and tailoring.\"[76]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, while eating at a restaurant with his family after performing at a Zion and Lennox concert, Bad Bunny met jewelry designer Gabriela Berlingeri.[24][119] They soon began collaborating professionally before being public about their relationship. This was seen when Berlingeri provided the reference vocals for Jennifer Lopez who featured on Bad Bunny’s track ‘Te Guste’. The two were spotted in public for the first time in 2020 at a Dallas Mavericks versus Miami Heat game in Miami. Bad Bunny would declare in an interview with Entertainment Tonight less than a month later that he was “in love.”[120] The two posted pictures with each other on social media for the first time on March 7, 2020, with a post on Bad Bunny’s Instagram. The two would continue to collaborate professionally as well. Berlingeri would feature on tracks like 2020’s “En Casita” and 2022’s “El Apagon,” and she also would be the photographer for his May 2020 *Rolling Stone* cover, making her the first-ever Latina to shoot the cover for the magazine.[121][20] The two however would go their separate ways in late 2022.[122]\n\n\nRumors of Bad Bunny being with model and media star Kendall Jenner first began to circulate in February 2023, after TMZ spotted the pair leaving a restaurant together.[123] Photos and videos of the two together on dates spread throughout the internet for months, with their first official public outing being at a Lakers-Warriors NBA playoff game on May 12, 2023.[124] In September 2023, the two featured together in a shoot for Gucci’s Valigeria campaign, one that “explores the intimacy of traveling together.”[125]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Bad Bunny had criticized a nail salon in Asturias, Spain, for refusing to give him service since he was a man; the post angered many fans, leading them to leave homophobic comments and question Bad Bunny's sexuality. Bad Bunny responded to the hateful comments by offering to impregnate the wives of his critics. The post was deleted and Bad Bunny later ended up apologizing and deleting his own Twitter account.[126][109]\n\n\nIn support of LGBT rights, Bad Bunny criticized a tweet by reggaeton artist Don Omar considered to be homophobic in January 2019.[127] During a performance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* in February 2020, he called attention to the murder of transgender woman Alexa Negrón Luciano in Puerto Rico by wearing a shirt with the words \"They Killed Alexa. Not a Man in a Skirt\", referencing news reports that had misgendered the victim.[128][24] Ricky Martin has stated that Bad Bunny \"has become an icon for the Latin queer community\" due to his support of gay and transgender Latinos as well as his embrace of drag culture.[24] Bad Bunny was recognized for his allyship in 2023 by queer advocacy organization GLAAD when Ricky Martin presented him with the Vanguard Award for allyship at the 34th GLAAD Media Awards.[129]\n\n\nBad Bunny has also expressed publicly that he views his own sexuality as fluid. In a 2020 interview with the *Los Angeles Times*, he stated “At the end of the day, I don’t know if in 20 years I will like a man. One never knows in life. But at the moment I am heterosexual and I like women.”[130] This fluidity was on display at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, when he kissed a male dancer during his performance of “Tití Me Preguntó.”[131]\n\n\n\n### Activism[edit]\n\n\nBad Bunny criticized the lack of humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island of Puerto Rico.[132] He established the Good Bunny Foundation, which distributes toys to children living in poverty in Puerto Rico.[24]\n\n\nIn 2019, he was nominated for Telemundo's inaugural *Premios Tu Música Urbano*, in the category of \"Humanitarian Award of the Year.\"[133]\n\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Bad Bunny joined artists such as Residente, Ricky Martin, and more than half a million Puerto Ricans in taking the streets and shutting down the Expreso Las Américas, a major highway also known as the Autopista Luis A. Ferré, in protests against government corruption and demanding Ricardo Rosselló's resignation from the office of Governor of Puerto Rico.[134] In May 2020, he had not taken a position regarding the Puerto Rican statehood movement and had stated that he would prefer to answer at a later time with more clarification.[24] He later concluded his answer in January 2021 stating that he would never \"want to see Puerto Rico become a State\". It was widely understood that he was not necessarily advocating for Puerto Rican independence, only that he opposed the territory ever becoming the 51st state.[135]\n\n\n\n### Legal Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, a woman who had been in a relationship with Bad Bunny from 2011-2016 filed a $40 million USD lawsuit against the rapper and his manager for unauthorized usage of a recording of her voice. According to the lawsuit, a 2015 recording of the woman saying \"Bad Bunny, baby\" was used without her permission in the songs \"Pa Ti\" and \"Dos Mil 16\".[136]\n\n\n\n## Professional wrestling career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Bad Bunny |\n| --- |\n| Professional wrestling career |\n| Billed height | 5 ft 11 in (180 cm) |\n| Billed weight | 165 lb (75 kg) |\n| Billed from | Vega Baja, Puerto Rico |\n| Trained by | WWE Performance CenterDrew GulakAdam PearceBrian Kendrick |\n| Debut | April 10, 2021 |\n\n\nA self-professed lifelong fan of professional wrestling, Bad Bunny began making appearances in the American promotion WWE in 2021. During WWE's annual Royal Rumble event held on January 31, 2021,[137] Bad Bunny performed his song \"Booker T\" live, which also had an appearance by the former wrestler of the same name.[138] He then began appearing on WWE's weekly television show, *Monday Night Raw*.[139]\n\n\nWrestler Damian Priest, a fellow Puerto Rican, allied with Bad Bunny and helped him win the WWE 24/7 Championship from Akira Tozawa on the February 15 episode of *Raw*.[140] On the March 15 episode, he relinquished the 24/7 Championship to R-Truth in exchange for \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin memorabilia, ending his reign at 28 days.[141][142] At WrestleMania 37, Bad Bunny teamed with Damian Priest in a tag team match to defeat The Miz and John Morrison in his in-ring wrestling debut.[143]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Royal Rumble on January 29, Bad Bunny returned to WWE, competing in the men's Royal Rumble match. He eliminated Sheamus and Dolph Ziggler and lasted until the final five, when he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Brock Lesnar.[144] On January 23, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would be a playable wrestler in the *WWE 2K23* video game as a pre-order bonus.[145]\n\n\nOn March 8, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would serve as the host for WWE's upcoming event, Backlash, taking place in his native Puerto Rico.[146] On April 1, 2023, Bad Bunny joined the Spanish announce team to commentate during the match between Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio on Night 1 of WrestleMania 39. Bunny would intervene during the match, preventing Dominik from attacking Rey with a chain.[147] Two nights later on *Raw*, Bunny—who was seated front row as a fan—was attacked and chokeslammed through the announcers table by former partner Damian Priest, who was now a teammate of Dominik Mysterio in The Judgment Day.[148] On the April 24 episode, Bunny returned and attacked Priest with a kendo stick, subsequently announcing that instead of hosting Backlash, he would be wrestling Priest in a San Juan Street Fight at the event.[149] On the May 5 episode of *SmackDown*, Bunny helped the Latino World Order (LWO) save Rey Mysterio from an attack from The Judgment Day, leading to Mysterio giving Bunny an LWO t-shirt, signifying his addition to the group.[150][151] At Backlash on May 6, Bunny defeated Damian Priest in a San Juan Street Fight, to the admiration of his home fans.[152]\n\n\n\n### Championships and accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n* **WWE**\n\t+ WWE 24/7 Championship (1 time)[153]\n\t+ Bumpy Award (1 time)\n\t\t- Best Moment of the Half-Year (2021) – Bad Bunny competing at WrestleMania[154]\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Bad Bunny\nThroughout his career Bad Bunny has received nine nominations at the Grammy Awards, winning three times for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album with *YHLQMDLG* (2021), Best Música Urbana Album for *El Último Tour Del Mundo* (2022) and *Un Verano Sin Ti* (2023), and he earned eleven Latin Grammy Awards out of twenty-seven nominations.

He went on to release songs such as \"Soy Peor\" and collaborate with Farruko, Karol G, Ozuna, and J Balvin.[3] His 2018 single \"Mia\" featuring Drake and appearing on Cardi B's single \"I Like It\" alongside J Balvin, topped the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100.[11] Bad Bunny's debut studio album, *X 100pre* (2018), peaked at number 11 on the U.S. *Billboard* 200,[12] while his collaborative album with J Balvin, *Oasis* (2019), reached the top-ten.[13] His second solo album, *YHLQMDLG* (2020), became the highest-charting all-Spanish album to appear on the *Billboard* 200 at the time.[14] It was followed up with the compilation album *Las que no iban a salir* (2020).[15]\n\n\n*El Último Tour Del Mundo* (2020), Bad Bunny's third solo album, became the first all-Spanish language album to top the *Billboard* 200.[16] Its lead single, \"Dákiti\", reached the top-ten of the Hot 100.

I liked to be at home with my family.\"[24]\n\n\nAs a child, he attended church weekly with his devoutly Catholic mother and sang in the church choir until age 13. After leaving the choir, he developed an interest in the artists he heard on the radio, particularly Daddy Yankee and Héctor Lavoe.[21] His stage name originally came from a time in which he was forced to wear a bunny costume and was angry about it.[22]\n\n\nSpeaking about the Puerto Rican music industry, he stated, \"I'm from Vega Baja, a small area that's not a metropolis like San Juan where the majority of the genre's artists have come from.\"[25]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–2017: Early career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nHe started to write and create his own interpretations at the age of 14,[26] until, in 2013, he began to publish his songs through SoundCloud, including \"Get\" in 2013, \"Tentación\" in 2014, \"Just let me know\" in 2015, among others.[27] In 2016, his song \"Diles\" caught the attention of DJ Luian from SoundCloud who signed him to his record label, Hear this Music.[5][28][29][30][31] His single \"Soy Peor\" reached number 19 on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[32] Bad Bunny's May 2017 collaboration with Karol G, \"Ahora Me Llama\", reached number 10 on the *Billboard* Hot Latin Songs chart.[33][34] It was listed on \"Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs Of 2017\" as one of the best Latin songs of 2017.[34]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Bad Bunny signed a booking deal with Cardenas Marketing Network (CMN) for several Latin American countries.[35] Starting in November 2017, Bad Bunny hosted Beats 1's first Spanish-language show, *Trap Kingz*.[36][37] The remix of \"Te Boté\" with Ozuna and Nicky Jam reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[38]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: Major breakthrough, *X 100pre*, and *Oasis*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *X100pre* and *Oasis*\n\n![](image)Bad Bunny performing in Ecuador in September 2018\nIn May 2018, American rapper Cardi B released a collaboration with Bad Bunny and J Balvin, \"I Like It\".[37][39] On October 11, 2018, Bad Bunny released \"Mia\" with Drake,[40][41] which reached number five on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[42]\n\n\nBad Bunny released his debut album *X 100pre* on December 24, 2018, on Christmas Eve 2018 on Rimas Entertainment.[43] At Metacritic, *X 100pre* received an average score of 84 based on five reviews.[44][45] Alexis Petridis of *The Guardian* praised Bad Bunny's \"off-kilter creativity\".[45]\n\n\nIn 2020, *X 100pre* was voted 447th in *Rolling Stone'*s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[46]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2019, Bad Bunny released *Oasis*, an eight-song collaborative album with J Balvin.[47] It peaked at number nine on the *Billboard* Hot 100[48] and topped the *Billboard* US Latin Albums chart.[49] In July 2019, he joined protests against governor Ricardo Rosselló.[50] Bad Bunny and Residente released \"*Afilando Los Cuchillos*\" (\"Sharpening the knives\") during the demonstrations.[51]\n\n\n\n### 2020–2021: *YHLQMDLG*, *Las que no iban a salir*, and *El Último Tour Del Mundo*[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Bad Bunny was a guest performer at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, headlined by Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.[52] Bad Bunny announced the album *YHLQMDLG* on February 27, 2020, during an appearance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* and stated that it would be released on Leap Day 2020, namely February 29.[53][54] The album's title stands for \"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana\" (Spanish for \"I Do What I Want\") and features collaborations with Daddy Yankee, Yaviah, Jowell & Randy, Ñengo Flow, among other artist.[54][55]\n\n\n*YHLQMDLG* debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200, becoming the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the chart at the time.[56] The album was met with critical acclaim, with the album's musical diversity being praised.[57] \"Vete\" was released as the lead single of the album on November 22, 2019.[58] The second single, \"Ignorantes\", with Panamanian singer Sech came out on February 14, 2020.[59][53] In March 2020, Bad Bunny released the music video for \"Yo Perreo Sola\", in which the artist performs in drag.[60] \"Yo Perreo Sola\" landed number one on the *Billboard* Latin Airplay chart, earning Bad Bunny his ninth No.1 on the chart in just over two years.[61]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2020, he released the song \"En Casita\" on SoundCloud, which expressed solidarity towards others in quarantine due to COVID-19 and featured vocals from his girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri.[62] On May 10, 2020, Bad Bunny released his first compilation *Las que no iban a salir*, without previous announcements.[63] The compilation's title translates to \"The Ones that Were Not Going to Come Out\" and it contains previously unreleased or unfinished songs.[64] The album features collaborations with Don Omar, Yandel, Zion & Lennox, Nicky Jam, and Jhay Cortez.[63] Discussing the album's surprise release, Bad Bunny explained, \"There was no real meaning behind it. I just thought, 'Damn.

The cover was shot by photographer Stillz in Miami, Florida, and the magazine includes a feature article entitled \"Bad Bunny is Not Playing God.\"[66] He also received the ASCAP Latin award for Songwriter of the Year.[67] The following month, his song \"Pero Ya No\" appeared in an advertisement for politician Joe Biden's 2020 United States presidential election campaign.[68] On September 20, 2020, Bad Bunny performed a surprise, live (via his YouTube channel and Uforia), free concert from atop a flatbed truck that looked like a subway car going through the streets of New York and ended at Harlem Hospital.[69][70][71] In October 2020, Bad Bunny released the single \"Dakiti\", with Jhay Cortez, which topped the *Billboard* Global 200 and reached number five on the US Hot 100. The song is included on his third studio album, *El Último Tour Del Mundo*, which was released on November 27, 2020, and was described as a personal and ambitious record.[72][73] It became the first all-Spanish language album to reach number one on the *Billboard* 200.[73]\n\n\nBad Bunny and *YHLQMDLG* respectively became Spotify's most-streamed artist and album globally in 2020.[74] It marked the first time a non-English language music artist topped the year-end list,[75] with a *The Guardian* article considering him \"the world's biggest pop star\" for his streaming numbers.[76] The album received the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.[77] On February 20, 2021, Bad Bunny performed \"La Noche de Anoche\" with Rosalía and \"Te Deseo Lo Mejor\" on *Saturday Night Live*, hosted by Regé-Jean Page, as well as appearing in the pre-recorded musical sketches \"Loco\" and \"Sea Shanty\".[78][79] On the US *Billboard* Hot 100, Bad Bunny's next single \"Yonaguni\" became his fourth top 10 entry and first with no accompanying acts.[80] Bad Bunny was cast in an upcoming David Leitch-directed film starring Brad Pitt.[81]\n\n\nIn July 2021, it was announced that Bad Bunny co-wrote and co-produced the fifth album of Puerto Rican Latin pop artist Tommy Torres titled *El Playlist de Anoche*.[82] Bad Bunny won the most awards at the 2021 *Billboard* Latin Music Awards with ten, including the category Artist of the Year.[83] In the following months, he was featured on Aventura's single \"Volví\",[84] and released \"Lo Siento BB:/\" with Tainy and Julieta Venegas.[85] In September 2021, he appeared on the *Time* 100, *Time*'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[86] Bad Bunny's 2022 concert tour, El Último Tour del Mundo, has visited the US and Canada indoor arenas.[87] He won Best Urban Music Album and Best Rap/Hip Hop Song at the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards.[88] *El Último Tour Del Mundo* won Best Música Urbana Album at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.[89] In December 2021, it was announced that Bad Bunny became Spotify's most-streamed artist of the year globally, for a second year in a row.[90]\n\n\nOn 24 December 2021, a short film and music video titled *Te Deseo Lo Mejor* was released in collaboration with the creators of *The Simpsons*.[91] The film was directed by David Silverman[92] and stars Humberto Vélez, Claudia Motta and Bad Bunny.[93]\n\n\n\n### 2022–present: *Un Verano Sin Ti* and *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Un Verano Sin Ti* and *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*\n\nIn January 2022, Bad Bunny was featured in Vogue Magazine for the second time modeling the current season's best bags.[94] In April 2022, Sony Pictures announced Bad Bunny as the lead for *El Muerto*, a film set in Sony's Spider-Man Universe. The film was originally set to be released on January 12, 2024,[95] prior to being removed from the release schedule.[96] On May 6, 2022, Bad Bunny released his fourth (fifth overall) studio album *Un Verano Sin Ti* which it became commercially successful as it debuted at number one on the *Billboard* 200 and stood there for thirteen non-consecutive weeks.[97][98]\n\n\nBad Bunny began his fourth concert tour World's Hottest Tour on August 5, 2022, set to visit fourteen countries of the American continent.[99] On October 4, 2022, the tour became the highest-grossing tour by a Latin artist in history, earning US$232.5 million at the time.[100] Bad Bunny received the most nominations (eight) for the 2022 American Music Awards, including his first for artist of the year.[101]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2023, Bad Bunny released his first solo single of the year titled \"Where She Goes\", in which he ventured into jersey club music. The music video had cameos from Frank Ocean, Lil Uzi Vert, Ronaldinho, and others.[102]\n\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair on September 12, 2023, Bad Bunny revealed that he is no longer involved in the upcoming El Muerto film after its schedule removal. He has also confirmed that he is working on a new album that is planned to come out sometime during the fall, Bad Bunny hinted at the possibility of the upcoming project's sound, confirming that he is “playing around and enjoying myself, letting go. I’m being inspired a lot by the music of the ’70s, —across genres, in both Spanish and English, but I’m not sure if this is going to shape my music, generally or just one song,”[103] After weeks of unconfirmed teasers and rumors, Bad Bunny revealed the album's title *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*, which has 22 tracks and was released on October 13, 2023.[104]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style and influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Soy Peor\" (2016)\n\n\nBad Bunny's breakthrough hit, the song exemplifies the artist's fast-paced vocal style and his Latin trap influences.\n\n\n---\n\n\"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" (2020)\n\n\nThe song \"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" from his album *YHLQMDLG* samples the bossa nova standard \"The Girl from Ipanema\" by Antônio Carlos Jobim[105] and features Bad Bunny alternating between rapping and singing.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing these files? See media help.*\n\nBad Bunny is considered to be primarily a Latin trap and reggaeton artist.[5][6][8][7] As described in a *Rolling Stone* article, Bad Bunny sings and raps with a \"conversational tone\", employing \"a low, slurry tone, viscous melodies, and a rapper's cadence.\"[25] Throughout the years, Bad Bunny has listed his influences with a wide variety of artists from multiple genres such as Héctor Lavoe, Vico C, Romeo Santos, Juan Luis Guerra, Elvis Crespo, Ricky Martin, Juan Gabriel, Don Omar, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Tego Calderón, Wisin & Yandel, Calle 13, Víctor Manuelle, and Marc Anthony, amongst many others. He considers himself to be a \"music fanatic\" which is the reason why he's inspired by so many people.[1][8][3][106][107][108][109] During an episode of *Behind the Music*, he talked about Ricky Martin's legacy for Latin music and Latin artists, and how Martin changed the music landscape for future Latin artists.[107][110][111] In the music video for Neverita, Bad Bunny paid homage to the Suavemente music video by Puerto Rican artist Elvis Crespo, leaving a message in the end translated from Spanish as \"In honor of the best video of all time\". Elvis Crespo later felt honored by his tribute and ended up doing a merengue version of the song himself in which he performed at the 2022 Latin Billboard Music Awards.[112][108][113]\n\n\nAlthough primarily considered to be a Latin trap and reggaeton artist, his music also incorporates various other elements from other genres such as pop, hip-hop, rock, electronic, reggae, dancehall, latin, soul, and R&B.[5][6][8][7][3] Some publications have credited him for bringing Latin trap into the mainstream in the English-language music market.[114][115][3]\n\n\nAccording to Timothy Monger of AllMusic, his lyrics \"range from humor and pathos to heartbreak and anger (sometimes in the same song).\"[5] According to *Paper*, other themes explored in Bad Bunny's music include \"self-love, inclusivity, and LGBTQ acceptance\".[116]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nVanessa Rosales of CNN has opined that \"in pink, florals and short shorts, Bad Bunny champions a new masculinity\".[117]\n\n\nHe has appeared at award shows with manicured, polished, and long fingernails.[8][118] Ben Beaumont-Thomas of *The Guardian* opined in 2020 that Bunny's style influenced fellow Latin artists, who \"often now share his highly colorful mashup of streetwear and tailoring.\"[76]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, while eating at a restaurant with his family after performing at a Zion and Lennox concert, Bad Bunny met jewelry designer Gabriela Berlingeri.[24][119] They soon began collaborating professionally before being public about their relationship. This was seen when Berlingeri provided the reference vocals for Jennifer Lopez who featured on Bad Bunny’s track ‘Te Guste’. The two were spotted in public for the first time in 2020 at a Dallas Mavericks versus Miami Heat game in Miami. Bad Bunny would declare in an interview with Entertainment Tonight less than a month later that he was “in love.”[120] The two posted pictures with each other on social media for the first time on March 7, 2020, with a post on Bad Bunny’s Instagram. The two would continue to collaborate professionally as well. Berlingeri would feature on tracks like 2020’s “En Casita” and 2022’s “El Apagon,” and she also would be the photographer for his May 2020 *Rolling Stone* cover, making her the first-ever Latina to shoot the cover for the magazine.[121][20] The two however would go their separate ways in late 2022.[122]\n\n\nRumors of Bad Bunny being with model and media star Kendall Jenner first began to circulate in February 2023, after TMZ spotted the pair leaving a restaurant together.[123] Photos and videos of the two together on dates spread throughout the internet for months, with their first official public outing being at a Lakers-Warriors NBA playoff game on May 12, 2023.[124] In September 2023, the two featured together in a shoot for Gucci’s Valigeria campaign, one that “explores the intimacy of traveling together.”[125]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Bad Bunny had criticized a nail salon in Asturias, Spain, for refusing to give him service since he was a man; the post angered many fans, leading them to leave homophobic comments and question Bad Bunny's sexuality. Bad Bunny responded to the hateful comments by offering to impregnate the wives of his critics. The post was deleted and Bad Bunny later ended up apologizing and deleting his own Twitter account.[126][109]\n\n\nIn support of LGBT rights, Bad Bunny criticized a tweet by reggaeton artist Don Omar considered to be homophobic in January 2019.[127] During a performance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* in February 2020, he called attention to the murder of transgender woman Alexa Negrón Luciano in Puerto Rico by wearing a shirt with the words \"They Killed Alexa. Not a Man in a Skirt\", referencing news reports that had misgendered the victim.[128][24] Ricky Martin has stated that Bad Bunny \"has become an icon for the Latin queer community\" due to his support of gay and transgender Latinos as well as his embrace of drag culture.[24] Bad Bunny was recognized for his allyship in 2023 by queer advocacy organization GLAAD when Ricky Martin presented him with the Vanguard Award for allyship at the 34th GLAAD Media Awards.[129]\n\n\nBad Bunny has also expressed publicly that he views his own sexuality as fluid. In a 2020 interview with the *Los Angeles Times*, he stated “At the end of the day, I don’t know if in 20 years I will like a man. One never knows in life. But at the moment I am heterosexual and I like women.”[130] This fluidity was on display at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, when he kissed a male dancer during his performance of “Tití Me Preguntó.”[131]\n\n\n\n### Activism[edit]\n\n\nBad Bunny criticized the lack of humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island of Puerto Rico.[132] He established the Good Bunny Foundation, which distributes toys to children living in poverty in Puerto Rico.[24]\n\n\nIn 2019, he was nominated for Telemundo's inaugural *Premios Tu Música Urbano*, in the category of \"Humanitarian Award of the Year.\"[133]\n\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Bad Bunny joined artists such as Residente, Ricky Martin, and more than half a million Puerto Ricans in taking the streets and shutting down the Expreso Las Américas, a major highway also known as the Autopista Luis A. Ferré, in protests against government corruption and demanding Ricardo Rosselló's resignation from the office of Governor of Puerto Rico.[134] In May 2020, he had not taken a position regarding the Puerto Rican statehood movement and had stated that he would prefer to answer at a later time with more clarification.[24] He later concluded his answer in January 2021 stating that he would never \"want to see Puerto Rico become a State\". It was widely understood that he was not necessarily advocating for Puerto Rican independence, only that he opposed the territory ever becoming the 51st state.[135]\n\n\n\n### Legal Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, a woman who had been in a relationship with Bad Bunny from 2011-2016 filed a $40 million USD lawsuit against the rapper and his manager for unauthorized usage of a recording of her voice. According to the lawsuit, a 2015 recording of the woman saying \"Bad Bunny, baby\" was used without her permission in the songs \"Pa Ti\" and \"Dos Mil 16\".[136]\n\n\n\n## Professional wrestling career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Bad Bunny |\n| --- |\n| Professional wrestling career |\n| Billed height | 5 ft 11 in (180 cm) |\n| Billed weight | 165 lb (75 kg) |\n| Billed from | Vega Baja, Puerto Rico |\n| Trained by | WWE Performance CenterDrew GulakAdam PearceBrian Kendrick |\n| Debut | April 10, 2021 |\n\n\nA self-professed lifelong fan of professional wrestling, Bad Bunny began making appearances in the American promotion WWE in 2021.

He eliminated Sheamus and Dolph Ziggler and lasted until the final five, when he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Brock Lesnar.[144] On January 23, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would be a playable wrestler in the *WWE 2K23* video game as a pre-order bonus.[145]\n\n\nOn March 8, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would serve as the host for WWE's upcoming event, Backlash, taking place in his native Puerto Rico.[146] On April 1, 2023, Bad Bunny joined the Spanish announce team to commentate during the match between Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio on Night 1 of WrestleMania 39. Bunny would intervene during the match, preventing Dominik from attacking Rey with a chain.[147] Two nights later on *Raw*, Bunny—who was seated front row as a fan—was attacked and chokeslammed through the announcers table by former partner Damian Priest, who was now a teammate of Dominik Mysterio in The Judgment Day.[148] On the April 24 episode, Bunny returned and attacked Priest with a kendo stick, subsequently announcing that instead of hosting Backlash, he would be wrestling Priest in a San Juan Street Fight at the event.[149] On the May 5 episode of *SmackDown*, Bunny helped the Latino World Order (LWO) save Rey Mysterio from an attack from The Judgment Day, leading to Mysterio giving Bunny an LWO t-shirt, signifying his addition to the group.[150][151] At Backlash on May 6, Bunny defeated Damian Priest in a San Juan Street Fight, to the admiration of his home fans.[152]\n\n\n\n### Championships and accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n* **WWE**\n\t+ WWE 24/7 Championship (1 time)[153]\n\t+ Bumpy Award (1 time)\n\t\t- Best Moment of the Half-Year (2021) – Bad Bunny competing at WrestleMania[154]\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Bad Bunny\nThroughout his career Bad Bunny has received nine nominations at the Grammy Awards, winning three times for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album with *YHLQMDLG* (2021), Best Música Urbana Album for *El Último Tour Del Mundo* (2022) and *Un Verano Sin Ti* (2023), and he earned eleven Latin Grammy Awards out of twenty-seven nominations.

She is widely regarded as one of the most prominent singers of the 21st century. After signing with Def Jam in 2005, Rihanna soon gained recognition with the release of her first two studio albums, *Music of the Sun* (2005) and *A Girl Like Me* (2006), both of which were influenced by Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten on the US *Billboard* 200 chart. Her third album, *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007), incorporated elements of dance-pop and established her status as a major icon in the music industry. The chart-topping single \"Umbrella\" earned Rihanna her first Grammy Award and catapulted her to global stardom.\n\n\nRihanna continued to mix pop, dance, and R&B genres on her next studio albums, *Rated R* (2009), *Loud* (2010), *Talk That Talk* (2011), and *Unapologetic* (2012), the last of which became her first *Billboard* 200 number one. The albums spawned a string of chart-topping singles, including \"Rude Boy\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\", \"What's My Name?\", \"S&M\", \"We Found Love\", and \"Diamonds\". Her eighth album, *Anti* (2016), showcased a new creative control following her departure from Def Jam. It became her second US number one album and featured the chart-topping single \"Work\". During her musical career, Rihanna has collaborated with many artists, such as Drake, Eminem, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Ne-Yo, and Shakira.\n\n\nWith sales of over 250 million records worldwide, Rihanna is the second-best-selling female music artist of all time and the highest-certified female artist of all time on the RIAA's Top Artists (Digital Singles) ranking.

She is the founder of the nonprofit organization Clara Lionel Foundation, cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, and fashion house Fenty under LVMH; she is the first black woman to head a luxury brand for LVMH.[6] Rihanna has also ventured into acting, appearing in major roles in *Battleship* (2012), *Home* (2015), *Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets* (2017), and *Ocean's 8* (2018). She was appointed as an ambassador of education, tourism, and investment by the Government of Barbados in 2018 and was declared a National Hero of Barbados on the first day of the country's parliamentary republic in 2021, entitling her to the style of \"The Right Excellent\" for life.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nRobyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados.[8] She is the daughter of accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty.[9][10] Her mother is an Afro-Guyanese, while her father is a Barbadian of African, Irish, English, and Scottish descent.[11][12][13][14] Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships.[15][16] She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. Rihanna's father used to abuse her mother physically, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights.[17]\n\n\nAs a child, Rihanna had many CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered, recalling, \"The doctors even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense.\"[15] By the time she was 14, her parents had divorced, and her health began to improve.[10][18] She grew up listening to reggae music.[15][19] She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere School, where she studied alongside future international cricketers Chris Jordan and Carlos Brathwaite.[20][15] At age 11, Rihanna was a cadet in Barbados' Cadet Corps; the later Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant.[21][22] She initially wanted to graduate from high school, though chose to pursue a musical career instead.[23]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2003–2006: Beginnings and early releases[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates in her home country of Barbados.[15] Without a name or any material, the girl group auditioned with American record producer Evan Rogers, who commented, \"The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.\"[15] Rihanna went to Rogers's hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's \"Emotion\" and Mariah Carey's \"Hero\".[24] Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna's mother present and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be sent to record labels.[24] Recordings were intermittent, taking about a year because she was only able to record during school holidays. \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album *Music of the Sun*.[25] That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers's and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.[24]\n\n\nRihanna's demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam.[26] When Jay-Z first heard the track \"Pon de Replay\", he felt the song was too big for her.[27] Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York City, where Jay-Z introduced her to music mogul Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid.[24][28] At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston's cover of \"For the Love of You\", as well as the demo tracks \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\".[24] Jay-Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future single \"Pon de Replay\".[27] His boss, L.A. Reid, was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay-Z not to let Rihanna leave the building until the contract was signed.[29] Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z's office until 3:00 in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label.[27]\nRihanna canceled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the United States to live with Rogers and his wife.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna performing at the KIIS-FM Jingle Ball, December 2005\nAfter signing with Def Jam, Jay-Z and his team did the A&R for Rihanna's debut album and spent the next three months recording and completing her debut album.[29] She worked with different producers to complete her debut studio album, primarily Rogers and his production partner Carl Sturken.[31] With several songs to pick as a lead single, \"Pon de Replay\" was chosen because it seemed like the best song suited for a summer release.[32] In May 2005, her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\", was released under her mononym \"Rihanna\". It charted successfully worldwide, peaking in the top five in fifteen countries, including at No. 2 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart.[33] The song became a club hit in the United States, peaking at No. 1 on the *Billboard* Dance Club Songs.[34]\n\n\n*Music of the Sun* was released in August 2005.

A second single, \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", was not as successful as its predecessor, but reached the top 10 in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.[36] Aside from her work in music, Rihanna made her acting debut in a cameo role in the successful straight-to-DVD film *Bring It On: All or Nothing*, released in August 2006.[37]\n\n\nA month after the release of her debut album, Rihanna began working on her second studio album.[38] *A Girl like Me* was released in April 2006.[39] *Rolling Stone* felt that \"the burning rock guitar\" and haunted strings of some of the album's tracks made \"*A Girl like Me* [...] likable.\"[40] The album was a commercial success, charting in the top 10 in 13 countries. The album reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 5 in the United Kingdom and the United States, where it sold 115,000 copies in its first week.[35][41] The album became Rihanna's first to be certified Platinum by the RIAA, after selling over 1,000,000 units.[42] Its lead single, \"SOS\", was an international success, charting in the top five in 11 countries. The song reached No. 1 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and in Australia, her first to reach this chart position.[43] \"Unfaithful\", the album's second single, reached the top 10 in 18 countries, including No. 1 in Canada and Switzerland.[44] Two more singles were released from the album: \"We Ride\" and \"Break It Off\".[45][46]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2008: Breakthrough with *Good Girl Gone Bad*[edit]\n\n\nIn early 2007, Rihanna appeared on the single \"Roll It\" with Jamaican band J-Status and fellow Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle.

Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre's spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be\".[182] Her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\" features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend.[36] Aiming for artistic growth, *A Girl like Me* expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature.[183] After her second album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots.\n\n\nRihanna's musical career has been an experiment with new musical ideas and stated that she wants \"to make music that could be heard in parts of the world that I'd never been to\".[184] With its provocative subject matter and lyrics, she began incorporating a wide range of genres including, pop, R&B, reggae, dubstep, hip hop and EDM.[185] During a review for *Good Girl Gone Bad*, *Slant Magazine* to write that Rihanna \"finally figured out that she's a dance artist and the majority of the album is comprised of uptempo dance-pop [songs like]\" \"Push Up on Me\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\".[186] It represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous albums and is described as a turning point in her career.[187][188] While the first half of the record shares many 1980s pop influences with songs like \"Don't Stop the Music\" and \"Shut Up and Drive\", the second half retreats into standard R&B.[15][189]\n\n\nRecorded after the assault by her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown, *Rated R* had a much darker tone and was filled with various emotions she experienced throughout 2009.[190] In her fifth album *Loud*, Rihanna reflects on the fun and energetic vibe she had while recording the album.[90] The album is a mixture of ballads, party anthems and empowering love songs.[191] *Talk That Talk* was similar to *Rated R*, as both contain hip hop, R&B, dancehall and dubstep genres.[192] *Loud* and *Talk That Talk* saw her explore sexuality in her work (\"S&M\" and \"Birthday Cake\") and return to her dancehall roots (\"Man Down\" and \"Watch n' Learn\").[193] She also branched out into house music with tracks like \"We Found Love\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\" and \"Complicated\".[194] Her songs are also inspired through record sampling from other artists.[195]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna has cited Madonna (*pictured*) as her idol and biggest influence.\nRihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest influence. She said that she wanted to be the \"black Madonna\" and praised her ability to reinvent herself throughout her career.[196] She noted, \"I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world.\"[196]\nAnother major influence on Rihanna's music and career has been Mariah Carey, whose song \"Hero\" she performed when Rihanna was still a teenager at her high school talent show.[197] She revealed that Carey's song \"Vision of Love\" \"was the song that made [her] want to do music.\"[198][199]\n\n\nIn her youth, she would see Bob Marley on television because of his fame in the Caribbean.[200] She stated, \"He's one of my favourite artists of all time – he really paved the way for every other artist out of the Caribbean\".[201] She built a shrine in her home dedicated to the reggae legend and has covered Marley's \"Is This Love\" and Bob Marley & The Wailers' \"Redemption Song\" during her concert tours.[202][203]\nDuring her childhood, she would go around singing Whitney Houston songs and \"A Whole New World\" into her hairbrush so much that her neighbors started calling her \"Robyn Redbreast\".[30] She also stated that one of the first songs she remembers falling in love with was Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" and that it \"was really inspiring, and it made me develop a passion for music, so really, she's partly responsible for me being here in this industry.\"[204][205]\n\n\nRihanna was also influenced by Janet Jackson, Aaliyah, Tupac, Beyoncé and Destiny's Child.[206][207][208][209] Other musical influences and idols include Celine Dion,[210] Grace Jones,[211] Lil' Kim,[212] Alicia Keys,[213] Prince,[214] Fefe Dobson,[215][216] and Brandy.[15] Rihanna takes influence from the different types of music she discovered when she came to America and revealed that rock music was one of the first genres she fell in love with.[179] She commented, \"as I grow older, I want to know more about music. I want to discover more types of music\".[15] She cited Brandy's fourth studio album, *Afrodisiac* (2004), as her main inspiration for her third album, *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007).[15] In her early career, her music contained strong influences of Caribbean music, including reggae and dancehall.[217] The music video of the song \"Rude Boy\" featured images inspired by her Caribbean roots.[217]\n\n\n\n### Videos and stage[edit]\n\n\nRihanna has worked with music video director Anthony Mandler on more than a dozen music videos, the first being \"Unfaithful\" (2006).[218] \"We've done 16 videos together; they're not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, I'm known for the 'Disturbia's and the 'Russian Roulette's and things like that, but 'Only Girl (In the World)' is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video,\" Mandler said.[218] Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, \"Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues\".[194] Jon Bream of the *Star Tribune* commented \"[i]n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the '00s ... Rihanna has perfected the pout, the long-legged strut, and trend-setting hairdos that keep women and men alike checking her out on YouTube.\"[219] George Epaminondas of *InStyle* considers Rihanna's music videos to be \"cinematic\" due to her \"blend of lush island rhythms and swinging pop and ... mischievous sensuality.\"[220]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna performing on Last Girl on Earth Tour in Australia\nMany of her music videos were shot as short films exploring issues such as love triangles, abuse and substance abuse romance, including \"We Found Love\" and \"Man Down\".[194] Her music video for \"Umbrella\" shows Rihanna's transition into adulthood and her newly adopted image.[221] The \"dark, creepy\" scenes of \"Disturbia\" have been compared to *Michael Jackson's Thriller*.[219][222] The video for \"Russian Roulette\" features Rihanna in a padded room playing a game of russian roulette with her partner. A scene of Rihanna being approached by a speeding car at night was compared to the altercation with Chris Brown.[223]\nIn 2011, Rihanna released three controversial music videos about sadomasochism, rape and domestic violence.[224] \"Man Down\", which features Rihanna shooting a man in a train station, was criticized by the Parents Television Council.[225] \"We Found Love\", which shows Rihanna and her love interest in a drug-filled unhealthy relationship,[223] sparked criticism from the Rape Crisis Centre for its message.[226] Charne Graham of the *Houston Press* defended her, asking, \"Why should Rihanna's music videos get everyone riled up when others' equally sexual and controversial videos are in rotation? [...] she just like[s] to make music videos that give us something to talk about.\"[224] Rihanna was the first woman to pass 2 billion cumulative views on the music video website Vevo.[227] As of December 2016, she has accumulated over 10 billion views on the site.\n\n\nDenis Armstrong of Canadian Online Explorer commented on her performance at the Ottawa Bluesfest, saying \"her show was a Disney-esque choreographed fantasy of non-stop hip-swiveling, sassy attitude and personal endearments and a string of funky, sugar-free hits.\"[228] Her performance of \"Disturbia\" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards was ranked tenth best on the MTV Video Music Awards, according to a *Billboard* poll.[229] Her revealing leather costumes during her Good Girl Gone Bad Tour were highly criticized by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, who recommended that her concert tour should be banned.[230] Whilst commenting on her third album's accompanying tour, *The Times* compared Rihanna's stage wardrobe styling to that of Janet Jackson and called her \"a vision of Ann Summers couture in thigh-high boots and a few scraps of black PVC.\"[231] In the October 2011 issue of British *Vogue*, Rihanna said her performance outfits and appearances are all an act; \"[t]hat's not me. That's a part I play. You know, like it's a piece of art, with all these toys and textures to play with\".[232]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna modeling haute couture fashion at the 2017 Met Gala in Manhattan, representing the theme Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons Art of the In-Between\nKnown for her style and image, the media have constantly followed the evolution of Rihanna's music and fashion sense.[233] In 2009, *New York* magazine described Rihanna's early look as that of \"a cookie-cutter teen queen\", noting she has the ability \"to shift looks dramatically and with such ease\".[234] Around the time of the release of her second studio album, *A Girl like Me* (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé.[235][236] In an interview with *Look* magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyoncé: \"Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we're different performers with different styles\".[237] She revealed during *Oprah's Next Chapter* that Def Jam's pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label.[238] According to Rihanna, \"I felt like they were giving me a blueprint. [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was.\"[239] With the release of her third album, *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller *Æon Flux* (2005).[240] She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound.[241]\n\n\nNico Amarca of *Highsnobiety* magazine wrote, \"over the course of her now 10-year career, [Rihanna] has undergone one of the most significant aesthetic metamorphoses the world has ever seen\".[242] Her image and fashion has changed several times with different hairstyles since the release of her third album.[243][244] She commented that as a child she \"used to watch her [mother] get dressed\" and that her love and admiration for fashion started with her mother.[245] When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, \"It's become more about taking a risk ... I always look for the most interesting silhouette or something that's a little off.\"[246] Jess Cartner-Morley of *The Guardian* wrote that \"Rihanna's wardrobe is the most talked-about, influential and dissected in pop right now\" and that whatever she wears \"is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells\".[247] Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna's fashion and style stating, \"I don't necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she's going to wear. It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting.\"[248]\n\n\nIn an interview with Alexa Chung during *Vogue* Festival 2015, Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing praised Rihanna by stylistically comparing her to some of the biggest fashion icons in music history, such as Madonna, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, and Prince.[249] Commenting on the cultural expectation for pop stars to be role models, Rihanna said \"[being a role model] became more of my job than I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That's it.\"[232] In a May 2013 interview with MTV, *The Vagina Monologues* writer and feminist Eve Ensler said, \"I'm a huge Rihanna fan, I think she has a kind of agency over her sexuality and she's open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she's immensely talented.\"[250][251]\n\n\nDescribed as one of the sexiest women of her generation,[252][253] she revealed that being a sex symbol is not a priority and that \"it's definitely flattering, but also uncomfortable.\"[254] Her appearance has landed her on the cover of magazines such as *Maxim*, *FHM*, *Rolling Stone*,[255] and in December 2012, Rihanna became the first woman to be featured on the cover of *GQ* magazine's \"Men of the Year\" issue.[255]\n\n\nRihanna made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2007.[256] She has made eight appearances in the years since; notably in 2015, for China: Through the Looking Glass, her Guo Pei-designed yellow dress garnered the most attention of the event, accruing a billion impressions on social media.[257] The dress, which had taken two years to make before Rihanna came across it,[258] became the subject of a documentary by Pietra Brettkelly, entitled *Yellow Is Forbidden*.[259]\nShe co-chaired the 2018 *Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination* themed event, wearing Maison Margiela.[260]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nRihanna is regarded by the media as a pop and fashion icon, particularly since her third studio album *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007).[261][262][263][264][265] Nick Levine of *Digital Spy* described *Good Girl Gone Bad* as \"the closest thing to a *Thriller* that 2007/08 is likely to produce\".[266] According to *Rolling Stone*, her single \"Umbrella\" and her eighth album *Anti* are regarded as among the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, respectively.[267][268] Her single \"We Found Love\" was ranked by *Billboard* as the 24th biggest US *Billboard* Hot 100 hit of all time[109] and her single \"Work\" has been credited by a *Billboard* editor for bringing the dancehall genre to the forefront of mainstream American music.[269] Music critic Jayson Greene of *Pitchfork* described Rihanna as the most influential singer of the past decade, writing:\n\n\n> \"Rihanna Voice has become an industry-wide idea, a creative property like the Korg synth or LinnDrum [...] We crave the thrill that you can only get when a dozen or so good ideas manifest themselves in a single voice. For the past 10 years, that voice has more or less been Rihanna's. Now that she's gleefully shredding it apart, she'll probably generate a whole new comet trail of Rihannabes. Inevitably, none of them will carry the charge, the glassy cool and subterranean heat, of the real thing.\"[270]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Rihanna at Madame Tussauds, London\n*Time* magazine included Rihanna on its 100 Most Influential People in the World issue in 2012 and 2018,[271] with Stella McCartney writing: \"She's one of the coolest, hottest, most talented, most liked, most listened to, most followed, most impressive artists at work today, but she does it in her own stride.

The house launched in a pop-up store on May 22, 2019, in Paris, before launching worldwide online on May 29 and included clothing, accessories, and footwear. It was the first line that LVMH had launched since 1987. The fashion brand was described as groundbreaking, and in a statement regarding the launch, Rihanna said that she had been given a \"unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits.\"[334] Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2021, Rihanna and LVMH decided to \"put on hold\" her Fenty fashion house and continue building on the SavagexFenty lingerie line.[335]\n\n\nRihanna exclusively uses her surname for business endeavors not related to her music career so as not to conflate the two.[336] In January 2019, Rihanna filed a lawsuit against her father, Ronald Fenty, over the use of the Fenty name for commercial purposes. The lawsuit alleges Rihanna's cosmetics brand, Fenty Beauty, was damaged commercially by her father's company, Fenty Entertainment, through misrepresentation of his company being affiliated with her.[337] In September 2021 Rihanna dropped the lawsuit against her father.[338]\n\n\n\n#### Fenty Beauty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fenty Beauty\n\n![](image)Rihanna in a promotional video for Fenty Beauty in 2018\nIn 2017, Rihanna launched her critically acclaimed cosmetics company Fenty Beauty under LVMH's Kendo Brands.

Forty shades became the new standard.\"[344]\n\n\n\n#### Savage X Fenty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Savage X Fenty\n\nIn 2018, Rihanna launched a lingerie brand named Savage X Fenty.

The exact details project were not announced until April 2019 when advertisements for Guava Island appeared on Spotify indicating something happening on \"Saturday Night | April 13\".[385] It was later revealed Amazon Studios would distribute the film and Regency Enterprises had financed the film, which was released on April 13.[386]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clara Lionel Foundation\n\nIn 2006, she created her Believe Foundation to help terminally ill children.[387][388]\nIn 2007, Rihanna was named as one of the Cartier Love Charity Bracelet Ambassadors, with each celebrity representing a different global charity.[389] To help raise awareness and combat HIV/AIDS, Rihanna and other public figures designed clothing for the February 2008 H&M Fashion Against AIDS line.[390][391] In 2008, Rihanna performed a series of charity concerts entitled A Girl's Night Out[392] to benefit the Believe Foundation. The concerts were made free for the public. Money from sponsors and advertisers were to be donated to provide medical supplies, school supplies and toys to children in need.[393][394][395] In September 2008, Rihanna contributed to the song \"Just Stand Up!\" with fifteen other female artists, who shared the stage to perform the song live on September 5, 2008, during the \"Stand Up to Cancer\" television special. The proceeds from the single were given to the fundraiser.[68] The television special helped raise $100 million for cancer research.[396]\n\n\n\n> \n> I feel strongly that all children everywhere should be afforded the opportunity of a quality education, therefore I'm proud to announce Clara Lionel Foundation's partnership with education advocacy leaders like the Global Partnership for Education and Global Citizen. Working together, I know we can amplify our efforts and ensure that millions of children gain access to education globally.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n – Rihanna, discussing the Clara Lionel Foundation's partnership with the Global Partnership for Education[397]\n\nRihanna founded the Clara Lionel Foundation (CLF) in 2012, in honor of her grandparents, Clara and Lionel Braithwaite. Programs include the Clara Braithwaite Center for Oncology and Nuclear Medicine at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Barbados, and education programs.[398][399] The CLF hosts an annual Diamond Ball charity fundraiser event. The inaugural event in 2014 raised over $2 million and the second raised over $3 million.[400][401] On February 12, 2012, Rihanna performed a benefit show at the House of Blues to raise money for the Children's Orthopaedic Center and the Mark Taper-Johnny Mercer Artists Program at Children's Hospital.[402] In November 2012, Rihanna gave $100,000 to food bank donation for Hurricane Sandy.[403] On January 3, 2014, Rihanna was part of the MAC Viva Glam campaign, which benefits women, men and children living with HIV/AIDS.[404] In March 2020, Rihanna donated $5,000,000 to COVID-19 relief[405] and followed that up with additional donations of personal protective equipment to the state of New York[406] and an offer of $700,000 worth of ventilators to her home country Barbados.[407] In April 2020, Rihanna further donated an additional $2,100,000, matching Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for a total of $4,200,000, to provide support and resources to individuals and children suffering from domestic violence amid the lockdown.[408]\n\n\nThe Clara Lionel Foundation gave big amounts of money to climate justice and climate resilience. Only in 2022 it allocated 13 million euro to climate justice.[409]\n\n\n\n### Advocacy[edit]\n\n\nDuring her performance at the NCAA March Madness Music Festival, Rihanna expressed her disagreement with Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act that allows companies and individuals to use their religious beliefs as protection, in case of being accused of discrimination against LGBT people.[410] Rihanna along with numerous other high-profile celebrities featured in an online video titled \"23 Ways You Could Be Killed If You Are Black in America\". The video was released in partnership with the We Are Here Movement and called for action against police brutality.[411]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Rihanna participated in the 2017 Women's March, which took place in New York among protests the day after US President Donald Trump's inauguration.[412] She has also criticized President Trump's immigration policies–including Executive Order 13769, which sought to ban citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the United States–and his response to the 2019 shootings in El Paso and Dayton.[413][414] In October 2019, she stated that she declined to perform at the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show in support of Colin Kaepernick following the controversy surrounding his role in the national anthem protests.[415] In February 2021, Rihanna extended her support to Indian farmers' protest against the farm bills through Twitter.[416]\n\n\nRihanna with many others called to a transformation of the global financial system so it will be better adjusted to stop climate change and poverty. One of the ideas is to give help to countries heavily suffering from climate change.[409]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![Rihanna wearing a black top and hoop earrings](image)Rihanna in 2012\nRihanna owns a $14 million penthouse in Lower Manhattan.[417] She also purchased a house in West London for £7 million in June 2018, to be closer to her work with her FENTY fashion label.[336] In December 2018, Rihanna put her Hollywood Hills mansion up for sale after a break-in six months before. The mansion was reported to have sold for $10.4m.[418] *Forbes* began reporting on Rihanna's earnings in 2012.[419]\n\n\nRihanna began dating American singer Chris Brown in 2007. After their relationship ended in February 2009, she entered an on-again, off-again relationship with Canadian rapper Drake, which lasted from 2009 to 2016.[420] During an interview with *Rolling Stone* in January 2013, Rihanna confirmed that she had rekindled her relationship with Brown,[421] although he remained under probation for their 2009 domestic violence case.[422] Their reunion followed persistent media speculation that occurred throughout 2012.[423][424] In May 2013, Brown stated during an interview that he and Rihanna had broken up again.[425] In 2017, Rihanna began dating Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel.[426][427] They split in January 2020.[428]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2021, American rapper ASAP Rocky confirmed during an interview with *GQ* that he and Rihanna were in a relationship.[429][430][431][432] On January 31, 2022, it was revealed that the couple was expecting their first child.[433] On May 19, 2022, it was confirmed that Rihanna had given birth to a son.[434][435][436] On May 10, 2023, Rocky and Rihanna revealed their son's name as RZA Athelaston Mayers, named after Wu-Tang Clan leader and founder RZA.[437] On February 12, 2023, during the Super Bowl LVII halftime show performance, Rihanna revealed she is pregnant with her second child, becoming the first person to headline a Super Bowl halftime show while pregnant.[438][439][440] The pregnancy was confirmed in a *British Vogue* cover story featuring her family, which was released days after the Super Bowl appearance.[441] On August 1, 2023, they welcomed their second son, named Riot Rose Mayers.[442]\n\n\n\n### Domestic violence case[edit]\n\n\nOn February 8, 2009, Rihanna's scheduled performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards was canceled.[69] Reports surfaced that her boyfriend at the time, Chris Brown, had physically assaulted her. He turned himself in to the police and was booked on suspicion of making criminal threats.[70][443] On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats.[71] Due to a leaked photograph from the police department obtained by TMZ.com—which revealed that Rihanna had sustained extensive visible injuries—an organization known as STOParazzi proposed \"Rihanna's Law\", which, if enacted, would \"deter employees of law enforcement agencies from releasing photos or information that exploits crime victims.\"[72] Gil Kaufman of VH1 reported the \"nonstop coverage of the Rihanna/Brown case has brought up a number of issues regarding the privacy of alleged victims of domestic violence, including the decision by almost all major news outlets to divulge the identity of the victim—which is not typically done in domestic-violence cases\" and discussed the controversial distribution of the leaked photograph.[444] Rihanna was subpoenaed to testify during a preliminary hearing in Los Angeles on June 22, 2009.[445] On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault. Brown received five years of probation and was ordered to stay 50 yards (46 m) away from Rihanna unless at public events, which then would be reduced to 10 yards (9 m).[446]\n\n\nOn September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a pre-recorded *Larry King Live* interview, his first public interview about the matter.[447][448][449][450] He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be.\"[447]\n\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by Rihanna\n\nAs of September 2018[update], Rihanna has sold over 250 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[451] Throughout her career, she has received numerous awards and honors, including 9 Grammy Awards, 12 *Billboard* Music Awards, 13 American Music Awards, 8 People's Choice Awards, among others.

She is widely regarded as one of the most prominent singers of the 21st century.

She is the founder of the nonprofit organization Clara Lionel Foundation, cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, and fashion house Fenty under LVMH; she is the first black woman to head a luxury brand for LVMH.[6] Rihanna has also ventured into acting, appearing in major roles in *Battleship* (2012), *Home* (2015), *Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets* (2017), and *Ocean's 8* (2018). She was appointed as an ambassador of education, tourism, and investment by the Government of Barbados in 2018 and was declared a National Hero of Barbados on the first day of the country's parliamentary republic in 2021, entitling her to the style of \"The Right Excellent\" for life.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nRobyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados.[8] She is the daughter of accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty.[9][10] Her mother is an Afro-Guyanese, while her father is a Barbadian of African, Irish, English, and Scottish descent.[11][12][13][14] Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships.[15][16] She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. Rihanna's father used to abuse her mother physically, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights.[17]\n\n\nAs a child, Rihanna had many CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered, recalling, \"The doctors even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense.\"[15] By the time she was 14, her parents had divorced, and her health began to improve.[10][18] She grew up listening to reggae music.[15][19] She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere School, where she studied alongside future international cricketers Chris Jordan and Carlos Brathwaite.[20][15] At age 11, Rihanna was a cadet in Barbados' Cadet Corps; the later Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant.[21][22] She initially wanted to graduate from high school, though chose to pursue a musical career instead.[23]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2003–2006: Beginnings and early releases[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates in her home country of Barbados.[15] Without a name or any material, the girl group auditioned with American record producer Evan Rogers, who commented, \"The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.\"[15] Rihanna went to Rogers's hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's \"Emotion\" and Mariah Carey's \"Hero\".[24] Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna's mother present and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be sent to record labels.[24] Recordings were intermittent, taking about a year because she was only able to record during school holidays. \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album *Music of the Sun*.[25] That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers's and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.[24]\n\n\nRihanna's demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam.[26] When Jay-Z first heard the track \"Pon de Replay\", he felt the song was too big for her.[27] Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York City, where Jay-Z introduced her to music mogul Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid.[24][28] At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston's cover of \"For the Love of You\", as well as the demo tracks \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\".[24] Jay-Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future single \"Pon de Replay\".[27] His boss, L.A. Reid, was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay-Z not to let Rihanna leave the building until the contract was signed.[29] Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z's office until 3:00 in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label.[27]\nRihanna canceled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the United States to live with Rogers and his wife.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna performing at the KIIS-FM Jingle Ball, December 2005\nAfter signing with Def Jam, Jay-Z and his team did the A&R for Rihanna's debut album and spent the next three months recording and completing her debut album.[29] She worked with different producers to complete her debut studio album, primarily Rogers and his production partner Carl Sturken.[31] With several songs to pick as a lead single, \"Pon de Replay\" was chosen because it seemed like the best song suited for a summer release.[32] In May 2005, her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\", was released under her mononym \"Rihanna\". It charted successfully worldwide, peaking in the top five in fifteen countries, including at No. 2 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart.[33] The song became a club hit in the United States, peaking at No. 1 on the *Billboard* Dance Club Songs.[34]\n\n\n*Music of the Sun* was released in August 2005. It debuted at No. 10 on the *Billboard* 200 and received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over 500,000 units.[35] The album sold over 2 million copies worldwide. A second single, \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", was not as successful as its predecessor, but reached the top 10 in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.[36] Aside from her work in music, Rihanna made her acting debut in a cameo role in the successful straight-to-DVD film *Bring It On: All or Nothing*, released in August 2006.[37]\n\n\nA month after the release of her debut album, Rihanna began working on her second studio album.[38] *A Girl like Me* was released in April 2006.[39] *Rolling Stone* felt that \"the burning rock guitar\" and haunted strings of some of the album's tracks made \"*A Girl like Me* [...] likable.\"[40] The album was a commercial success, charting in the top 10 in 13 countries. The album reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 5 in the United Kingdom and the United States, where it sold 115,000 copies in its first week.[35][41] The album became Rihanna's first to be certified Platinum by the RIAA, after selling over 1,000,000 units.[42] Its lead single, \"SOS\", was an international success, charting in the top five in 11 countries. The song reached No. 1 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and in Australia, her first to reach this chart position.[43] \"Unfaithful\", the album's second single, reached the top 10 in 18 countries, including No. 1 in Canada and Switzerland.[44] Two more singles were released from the album: \"We Ride\" and \"Break It Off\".[45][46]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2008: Breakthrough with *Good Girl Gone Bad*[edit]\n\n\nIn early 2007, Rihanna appeared on the single \"Roll It\" with Jamaican band J-Status and fellow Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle.

Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre's spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be\".[182] Her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\" features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend.[36] Aiming for artistic growth, *A Girl like Me* expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature.[183] After her second album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots.\n\n\nRihanna's musical career has been an experiment with new musical ideas and stated that she wants \"to make music that could be heard in parts of the world that I'd never been to\".[184] With its provocative subject matter and lyrics, she began incorporating a wide range of genres including, pop, R&B, reggae, dubstep, hip hop and EDM.[185] During a review for *Good Girl Gone Bad*, *Slant Magazine* to write that Rihanna \"finally figured out that she's a dance artist and the majority of the album is comprised of uptempo dance-pop [songs like]\" \"Push Up on Me\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\".[186] It represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous albums and is described as a turning point in her career.[187][188] While the first half of the record shares many 1980s pop influences with songs like \"Don't Stop the Music\" and \"Shut Up and Drive\", the second half retreats into standard R&B.[15][189]\n\n\nRecorded after the assault by her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown, *Rated R* had a much darker tone and was filled with various emotions she experienced throughout 2009.[190] In her fifth album *Loud*, Rihanna reflects on the fun and energetic vibe she had while recording the album.[90] The album is a mixture of ballads, party anthems and empowering love songs.[191] *Talk That Talk* was similar to *Rated R*, as both contain hip hop, R&B, dancehall and dubstep genres.[192] *Loud* and *Talk That Talk* saw her explore sexuality in her work (\"S&M\" and \"Birthday Cake\") and return to her dancehall roots (\"Man Down\" and \"Watch n' Learn\").[193] She also branched out into house music with tracks like \"We Found Love\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\" and \"Complicated\".[194] Her songs are also inspired through record sampling from other artists.[195]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna has cited Madonna (*pictured*) as her idol and biggest influence.\nRihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest influence. She said that she wanted to be the \"black Madonna\" and praised her ability to reinvent herself throughout her career.[196] She noted, \"I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world.\"[196]\nAnother major influence on Rihanna's music and career has been Mariah Carey, whose song \"Hero\" she performed when Rihanna was still a teenager at her high school talent show.[197] She revealed that Carey's song \"Vision of Love\" \"was the song that made [her] want to do music.\"[198][199]\n\n\nIn her youth, she would see Bob Marley on television because of his fame in the Caribbean.[200] She stated, \"He's one of my favourite artists of all time – he really paved the way for every other artist out of the Caribbean\".[201] She built a shrine in her home dedicated to the reggae legend and has covered Marley's \"Is This Love\" and Bob Marley & The Wailers' \"Redemption Song\" during her concert tours.[202][203]\nDuring her childhood, she would go around singing Whitney Houston songs and \"A Whole New World\" into her hairbrush so much that her neighbors started calling her \"Robyn Redbreast\".[30] She also stated that one of the first songs she remembers falling in love with was Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" and that it \"was really inspiring, and it made me develop a passion for music, so really, she's partly responsible for me being here in this industry.\"[204][205]\n\n\nRihanna was also influenced by Janet Jackson, Aaliyah, Tupac, Beyoncé and Destiny's Child.[206][207][208][209] Other musical influences and idols include Celine Dion,[210] Grace Jones,[211] Lil' Kim,[212] Alicia Keys,[213] Prince,[214] Fefe Dobson,[215][216] and Brandy.[15] Rihanna takes influence from the different types of music she discovered when she came to America and revealed that rock music was one of the first genres she fell in love with.[179] She commented, \"as I grow older, I want to know more about music. I want to discover more types of music\".[15] She cited Brandy's fourth studio album, *Afrodisiac* (2004), as her main inspiration for her third album, *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007).[15] In her early career, her music contained strong influences of Caribbean music, including reggae and dancehall.[217] The music video of the song \"Rude Boy\" featured images inspired by her Caribbean roots.[217]\n\n\n\n### Videos and stage[edit]\n\n\nRihanna has worked with music video director Anthony Mandler on more than a dozen music videos, the first being \"Unfaithful\" (2006).[218] \"We've done 16 videos together; they're not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, I'm known for the 'Disturbia's and the 'Russian Roulette's and things like that, but 'Only Girl (In the World)' is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video,\" Mandler said.[218] Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, \"Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues\".[194] Jon Bream of the *Star Tribune* commented \"[i]n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the '00s ... Rihanna has perfected the pout, the long-legged strut, and trend-setting hairdos that keep women and men alike checking her out on YouTube.\"[219] George Epaminondas of *InStyle* considers Rihanna's music videos to be \"cinematic\" due to her \"blend of lush island rhythms and swinging pop and ... mischievous sensuality.\"[220]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna performing on Last Girl on Earth Tour in Australia\nMany of her music videos were shot as short films exploring issues such as love triangles, abuse and substance abuse romance, including \"We Found Love\" and \"Man Down\".[194] Her music video for \"Umbrella\" shows Rihanna's transition into adulthood and her newly adopted image.[221] The \"dark, creepy\" scenes of \"Disturbia\" have been compared to *Michael Jackson's Thriller*.[219][222] The video for \"Russian Roulette\" features Rihanna in a padded room playing a game of russian roulette with her partner. A scene of Rihanna being approached by a speeding car at night was compared to the altercation with Chris Brown.[223]\nIn 2011, Rihanna released three controversial music videos about sadomasochism, rape and domestic violence.[224] \"Man Down\", which features Rihanna shooting a man in a train station, was criticized by the Parents Television Council.[225] \"We Found Love\", which shows Rihanna and her love interest in a drug-filled unhealthy relationship,[223] sparked criticism from the Rape Crisis Centre for its message.[226] Charne Graham of the *Houston Press* defended her, asking, \"Why should Rihanna's music videos get everyone riled up when others' equally sexual and controversial videos are in rotation? [...] she just like[s] to make music videos that give us something to talk about.\"[224] Rihanna was the first woman to pass 2 billion cumulative views on the music video website Vevo.[227] As of December 2016, she has accumulated over 10 billion views on the site.\n\n\nDenis Armstrong of Canadian Online Explorer commented on her performance at the Ottawa Bluesfest, saying \"her show was a Disney-esque choreographed fantasy of non-stop hip-swiveling, sassy attitude and personal endearments and a string of funky, sugar-free hits.\"[228] Her performance of \"Disturbia\" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards was ranked tenth best on the MTV Video Music Awards, according to a *Billboard* poll.[229] Her revealing leather costumes during her Good Girl Gone Bad Tour were highly criticized by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, who recommended that her concert tour should be banned.[230] Whilst commenting on her third album's accompanying tour, *The Times* compared Rihanna's stage wardrobe styling to that of Janet Jackson and called her \"a vision of Ann Summers couture in thigh-high boots and a few scraps of black PVC.\"[231] In the October 2011 issue of British *Vogue*, Rihanna said her performance outfits and appearances are all an act; \"[t]hat's not me. That's a part I play. You know, like it's a piece of art, with all these toys and textures to play with\".[232]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rihanna modeling haute couture fashion at the 2017 Met Gala in Manhattan, representing the theme Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons Art of the In-Between\nKnown for her style and image, the media have constantly followed the evolution of Rihanna's music and fashion sense.[233] In 2009, *New York* magazine described Rihanna's early look as that of \"a cookie-cutter teen queen\", noting she has the ability \"to shift looks dramatically and with such ease\".[234] Around the time of the release of her second studio album, *A Girl like Me* (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé.[235][236] In an interview with *Look* magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyoncé: \"Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we're different performers with different styles\".[237] She revealed during *Oprah's Next Chapter* that Def Jam's pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label.[238] According to Rihanna, \"I felt like they were giving me a blueprint. [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was.\"[239] With the release of her third album, *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller *Æon Flux* (2005).[240] She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound.[241]\n\n\nNico Amarca of *Highsnobiety* magazine wrote, \"over the course of her now 10-year career, [Rihanna] has undergone one of the most significant aesthetic metamorphoses the world has ever seen\".[242] Her image and fashion has changed several times with different hairstyles since the release of her third album.[243][244] She commented that as a child she \"used to watch her [mother] get dressed\" and that her love and admiration for fashion started with her mother.[245] When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, \"It's become more about taking a risk ... I always look for the most interesting silhouette or something that's a little off.\"[246] Jess Cartner-Morley of *The Guardian* wrote that \"Rihanna's wardrobe is the most talked-about, influential and dissected in pop right now\" and that whatever she wears \"is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells\".[247] Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna's fashion and style stating, \"I don't necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she's going to wear. It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting.\"[248]\n\n\nIn an interview with Alexa Chung during *Vogue* Festival 2015, Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing praised Rihanna by stylistically comparing her to some of the biggest fashion icons in music history, such as Madonna, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, and Prince.[249] Commenting on the cultural expectation for pop stars to be role models, Rihanna said \"[being a role model] became more of my job than I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That's it.\"[232] In a May 2013 interview with MTV, *The Vagina Monologues* writer and feminist Eve Ensler said, \"I'm a huge Rihanna fan, I think she has a kind of agency over her sexuality and she's open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she's immensely talented.\"[250][251]\n\n\nDescribed as one of the sexiest women of her generation,[252][253] she revealed that being a sex symbol is not a priority and that \"it's definitely flattering, but also uncomfortable.\"[254] Her appearance has landed her on the cover of magazines such as *Maxim*, *FHM*, *Rolling Stone*,[255] and in December 2012, Rihanna became the first woman to be featured on the cover of *GQ* magazine's \"Men of the Year\" issue.[255]\n\n\nRihanna made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2007.[256] She has made eight appearances in the years since; notably in 2015, for China: Through the Looking Glass, her Guo Pei-designed yellow dress garnered the most attention of the event, accruing a billion impressions on social media.[257] The dress, which had taken two years to make before Rihanna came across it,[258] became the subject of a documentary by Pietra Brettkelly, entitled *Yellow Is Forbidden*.[259]\nShe co-chaired the 2018 *Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination* themed event, wearing Maison Margiela.[260]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nRihanna is regarded by the media as a pop and fashion icon, particularly since her third studio album *Good Girl Gone Bad* (2007).[261][262][263][264][265] Nick Levine of *Digital Spy* described *Good Girl Gone Bad* as \"the closest thing to a *Thriller* that 2007/08 is likely to produce\".[266] According to *Rolling Stone*, her single \"Umbrella\" and her eighth album *Anti* are regarded as among the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, respectively.[267][268] Her single \"We Found Love\" was ranked by *Billboard* as the 24th biggest US *Billboard* Hot 100 hit of all time[109] and her single \"Work\" has been credited by a *Billboard* editor for bringing the dancehall genre to the forefront of mainstream American music.[269] Music critic Jayson Greene of *Pitchfork* described Rihanna as the most influential singer of the past decade, writing:\n\n\n> \"Rihanna Voice has become an industry-wide idea, a creative property like the Korg synth or LinnDrum [...] We crave the thrill that you can only get when a dozen or so good ideas manifest themselves in a single voice. For the past 10 years, that voice has more or less been Rihanna's. Now that she's gleefully shredding it apart, she'll probably generate a whole new comet trail of Rihannabes. Inevitably, none of them will carry the charge, the glassy cool and subterranean heat, of the real thing.\"[270]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Rihanna at Madame Tussauds, London\n*Time* magazine included Rihanna on its 100 Most Influential People in the World issue in 2012 and 2018,[271] with Stella McCartney writing: \"She's one of the coolest, hottest, most talented, most liked, most listened to, most followed, most impressive artists at work today, but she does it in her own stride.

The house launched in a pop-up store on May 22, 2019, in Paris, before launching worldwide online on May 29 and included clothing, accessories, and footwear. It was the first line that LVMH had launched since 1987. The fashion brand was described as groundbreaking, and in a statement regarding the launch, Rihanna said that she had been given a \"unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits.\"[334] Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2021, Rihanna and LVMH decided to \"put on hold\" her Fenty fashion house and continue building on the SavagexFenty lingerie line.[335]\n\n\nRihanna exclusively uses her surname for business endeavors not related to her music career so as not to conflate the two.[336] In January 2019, Rihanna filed a lawsuit against her father, Ronald Fenty, over the use of the Fenty name for commercial purposes. The lawsuit alleges Rihanna's cosmetics brand, Fenty Beauty, was damaged commercially by her father's company, Fenty Entertainment, through misrepresentation of his company being affiliated with her.[337] In September 2021 Rihanna dropped the lawsuit against her father.[338]\n\n\n\n#### Fenty Beauty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fenty Beauty\n\n![](image)Rihanna in a promotional video for Fenty Beauty in 2018\nIn 2017, Rihanna launched her critically acclaimed cosmetics company Fenty Beauty under LVMH's Kendo Brands.

Forty shades became the new standard.\"[344]\n\n\n\n#### Savage X Fenty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Savage X Fenty\n\nIn 2018, Rihanna launched a lingerie brand named Savage X Fenty.

The exact details project were not announced until April 2019 when advertisements for Guava Island appeared on Spotify indicating something happening on \"Saturday Night | April 13\".[385] It was later revealed Amazon Studios would distribute the film and Regency Enterprises had financed the film, which was released on April 13.[386]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clara Lionel Foundation\n\nIn 2006, she created her Believe Foundation to help terminally ill children.[387][388]\nIn 2007, Rihanna was named as one of the Cartier Love Charity Bracelet Ambassadors, with each celebrity representing a different global charity.[389] To help raise awareness and combat HIV/AIDS, Rihanna and other public figures designed clothing for the February 2008 H&M Fashion Against AIDS line.[390][391] In 2008, Rihanna performed a series of charity concerts entitled A Girl's Night Out[392] to benefit the Believe Foundation. The concerts were made free for the public. Money from sponsors and advertisers were to be donated to provide medical supplies, school supplies and toys to children in need.[393][394][395] In September 2008, Rihanna contributed to the song \"Just Stand Up!\" with fifteen other female artists, who shared the stage to perform the song live on September 5, 2008, during the \"Stand Up to Cancer\" television special. The proceeds from the single were given to the fundraiser.[68] The television special helped raise $100 million for cancer research.[396]\n\n\n\n> \n> I feel strongly that all children everywhere should be afforded the opportunity of a quality education, therefore I'm proud to announce Clara Lionel Foundation's partnership with education advocacy leaders like the Global Partnership for Education and Global Citizen. Working together, I know we can amplify our efforts and ensure that millions of children gain access to education globally.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n – Rihanna, discussing the Clara Lionel Foundation's partnership with the Global Partnership for Education[397]\n\nRihanna founded the Clara Lionel Foundation (CLF) in 2012, in honor of her grandparents, Clara and Lionel Braithwaite. Programs include the Clara Braithwaite Center for Oncology and Nuclear Medicine at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Barbados, and education programs.[398][399] The CLF hosts an annual Diamond Ball charity fundraiser event. The inaugural event in 2014 raised over $2 million and the second raised over $3 million.[400][401] On February 12, 2012, Rihanna performed a benefit show at the House of Blues to raise money for the Children's Orthopaedic Center and the Mark Taper-Johnny Mercer Artists Program at Children's Hospital.[402] In November 2012, Rihanna gave $100,000 to food bank donation for Hurricane Sandy.[403] On January 3, 2014, Rihanna was part of the MAC Viva Glam campaign, which benefits women, men and children living with HIV/AIDS.[404] In March 2020, Rihanna donated $5,000,000 to COVID-19 relief[405] and followed that up with additional donations of personal protective equipment to the state of New York[406] and an offer of $700,000 worth of ventilators to her home country Barbados.[407] In April 2020, Rihanna further donated an additional $2,100,000, matching Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for a total of $4,200,000, to provide support and resources to individuals and children suffering from domestic violence amid the lockdown.[408]\n\n\nThe Clara Lionel Foundation gave big amounts of money to climate justice and climate resilience. Only in 2022 it allocated 13 million euro to climate justice.[409]\n\n\n\n### Advocacy[edit]\n\n\nDuring her performance at the NCAA March Madness Music Festival, Rihanna expressed her disagreement with Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act that allows companies and individuals to use their religious beliefs as protection, in case of being accused of discrimination against LGBT people.[410] Rihanna along with numerous other high-profile celebrities featured in an online video titled \"23 Ways You Could Be Killed If You Are Black in America\". The video was released in partnership with the We Are Here Movement and called for action against police brutality.[411]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Rihanna participated in the 2017 Women's March, which took place in New York among protests the day after US President Donald Trump's inauguration.[412] She has also criticized President Trump's immigration policies–including Executive Order 13769, which sought to ban citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the United States–and his response to the 2019 shootings in El Paso and Dayton.[413][414] In October 2019, she stated that she declined to perform at the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show in support of Colin Kaepernick following the controversy surrounding his role in the national anthem protests.[415] In February 2021, Rihanna extended her support to Indian farmers' protest against the farm bills through Twitter.[416]\n\n\nRihanna with many others called to a transformation of the global financial system so it will be better adjusted to stop climate change and poverty. One of the ideas is to give help to countries heavily suffering from climate change.[409]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![Rihanna wearing a black top and hoop earrings](image)Rihanna in 2012\nRihanna owns a $14 million penthouse in Lower Manhattan.[417] She also purchased a house in West London for £7 million in June 2018, to be closer to her work with her FENTY fashion label.[336] In December 2018, Rihanna put her Hollywood Hills mansion up for sale after a break-in six months before. The mansion was reported to have sold for $10.4m.[418] *Forbes* began reporting on Rihanna's earnings in 2012.[419]\n\n\nRihanna began dating American singer Chris Brown in 2007. After their relationship ended in February 2009, she entered an on-again, off-again relationship with Canadian rapper Drake, which lasted from 2009 to 2016.[420] During an interview with *Rolling Stone* in January 2013, Rihanna confirmed that she had rekindled her relationship with Brown,[421] although he remained under probation for their 2009 domestic violence case.[422] Their reunion followed persistent media speculation that occurred throughout 2012.[423][424] In May 2013, Brown stated during an interview that he and Rihanna had broken up again.[425] In 2017, Rihanna began dating Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel.[426][427] They split in January 2020.[428]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2021, American rapper ASAP Rocky confirmed during an interview with *GQ* that he and Rihanna were in a relationship.[429][430][431][432] On January 31, 2022, it was revealed that the couple was expecting their first child.[433] On May 19, 2022, it was confirmed that Rihanna had given birth to a son.[434][435][436] On May 10, 2023, Rocky and Rihanna revealed their son's name as RZA Athelaston Mayers, named after Wu-Tang Clan leader and founder RZA.[437] On February 12, 2023, during the Super Bowl LVII halftime show performance, Rihanna revealed she is pregnant with her second child, becoming the first person to headline a Super Bowl halftime show while pregnant.[438][439][440] The pregnancy was confirmed in a *British Vogue* cover story featuring her family, which was released days after the Super Bowl appearance.[441] On August 1, 2023, they welcomed their second son, named Riot Rose Mayers.[442]\n\n\n\n### Domestic violence case[edit]\n\n\nOn February 8, 2009, Rihanna's scheduled performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards was canceled.[69] Reports surfaced that her boyfriend at the time, Chris Brown, had physically assaulted her. He turned himself in to the police and was booked on suspicion of making criminal threats.[70][443] On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats.[71] Due to a leaked photograph from the police department obtained by TMZ.com—which revealed that Rihanna had sustained extensive visible injuries—an organization known as STOParazzi proposed \"Rihanna's Law\", which, if enacted, would \"deter employees of law enforcement agencies from releasing photos or information that exploits crime victims.\"[72] Gil Kaufman of VH1 reported the \"nonstop coverage of the Rihanna/Brown case has brought up a number of issues regarding the privacy of alleged victims of domestic violence, including the decision by almost all major news outlets to divulge the identity of the victim—which is not typically done in domestic-violence cases\" and discussed the controversial distribution of the leaked photograph.[444] Rihanna was subpoenaed to testify during a preliminary hearing in Los Angeles on June 22, 2009.[445] On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault. Brown received five years of probation and was ordered to stay 50 yards (46 m) away from Rihanna unless at public events, which then would be reduced to 10 yards (9 m).[446]\n\n\nOn September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a pre-recorded *Larry King Live* interview, his first public interview about the matter.[447][448][449][450] He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be.\"[447]\n\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by Rihanna\n\nAs of September 2018[update], Rihanna has sold over 250 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[451] Throughout her career, she has received numerous awards and honors, including 9 Grammy Awards, 12 *Billboard* Music Awards, 13 American Music Awards, 8 People's Choice Awards, among others.
