These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.\nThe IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes unofficial tables only per single Games. This table was thus compiled by adding up single entries from the IOC database.[1]\n\n\nThe results are attributed to the IOC country code as currently displayed by the IOC database. Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors.\n\n\n\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Summer Olympic medals.\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Winter Olympic medals.\n\n## List of NOCs with medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\nThe table is pre-sorted by the name of each Olympic Committee, but can be displayed as sorted by any other column, such as the total number of gold medals or total number of overall medals. To sort by gold, silver, and then bronze, sort first by the bronze column, then the silver, and then the gold. The table does not count revoked medals (e.g., due to doping).\n\n\nA total of 156 current and historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 5 May 2023 are taken into account.\n\n\n\nSpecial delegation, not an actual nation\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Summer Olympic Games | Winter Olympic Games | Combined total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team

are not equal for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Some sports (such as boxing, judo, taekwondo, and wrestling) award or have previously awarded two bronze medals per competition.\n* Team sports medals, such as in football or basketball count as one, even if there are multiple players on each team, who get a medal.\n* Some tied performances have resulted in multiple medals of the same colour being awarded for an event. If this tie is for gold or silver, there will be a consequent absence of a silver or bronze medal for that event.\n* Some medals that have been revoked have not been re-awarded.\n* Some early events, such as cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics, had only two entrants.\n* Retroactively awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals for the 1896 and 1900 games results in some anomalies, such as the 100 metre freestyle swimming event in 1896 where no surviving records distinguish the places of those who finished between 3rd and 10th position.\n\n\n## List of NOCs without medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, 68 of the current 206 National Olympic Committees have yet to win an Olympic medal. Seven historic National Olympic Committees and the Refugee Olympic Team are also included in this list.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team (IOC code)\n | No. Summer\n | No. Winter\n | No. Games\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Albania (ALB) | 9 | 5 | 14\n |\n| ![](image) American Samoa (ASA) | 9 | 2 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Andorra (AND) | 12 | 13 | 25\n |\n| ![](image) Angola (ANG) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Antigua and Barbuda (ANT) | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Aruba (ARU) | 9 | 0 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh (BAN) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Belize (BIZ) [BIZ] | 13 | 0 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Benin (BEN) [BEN] | 12 | 0 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Bhutan (BHU) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Bolivia (BOL) | 15 | 7 | 22\n |\n| ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) | 8 | 8 | 16\n |\n| ![](image) British Virgin Islands (IVB) | 10 | 2 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Brunei (BRU) [A] | 6 | 0 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Cambodia (CAM) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Cape Verde (CPV) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Cayman Islands (CAY) | 11 | 2 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Central African Republic (CAF) | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Chad (CHA) | 13 | 0 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Comoros (COM) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of the Congo (CGO) | 13 | 0 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Democratic Republic of the Congo (COD) [COD] | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Cook Islands (COK) | 9 | 0 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Dominica (DMA) | 7 | 1 | 8\n |\n| ![](image) El Salvador (ESA) | 12 | 0 | 12\n |\n| ![Eswatini](image) Eswatini (SWZ) [SWZ] | 11 | 1 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Equatorial Guinea (GEQ) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) The Gambia (GAM) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Guam (GUM) | 9 | 1 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Guinea (GUI) | 12 | 0 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Guinea-Bissau (GBS) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Honduras (HON) | 12 | 1 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Kiribati (KIR) | 5 | 0 | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Laos (LAO) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Lesotho (LES) | 12 | 0 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Liberia (LBR) [C] | 13 | 0 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Libya (LBA) [D] | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Madagascar (MAD) | 13 | 3 | 16\n |\n| ![](image) Malawi (MAW) | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Maldives (MDV) | 9 | 0 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Mali (MLI) | 14 | 0 | 14\n |\n| ![](image) Malta (MLT) | 17 | 3 | 20\n |\n| ![](image) Marshall Islands (MHL) | 4 | 0 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Mauritania (MTN) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) | 6 | 0 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Monaco (MON) [N] | 21 | 11 | 32\n |\n| ![](image) Myanmar (MYA) [MYA] | 18 | 0 | 18\n |\n| ![](image) Nauru (NRU) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Nepal (NEP)[a] | 14 | 4 | 18\n |\n| ![](image) Nicaragua (NCA) | 13 | 0 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Oman (OMA) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Palau (PLW) | 6 | 0 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Palestine (PLE) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Papua New Guinea (PNG) | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Rwanda (RWA) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Saint Kitts and Nevis (SKN) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Saint Lucia (LCA) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (VIN) | 9 | 0 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Seychelles (SEY) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Sierra Leone (SLE) | 12 | 0 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Solomon Islands (SOL) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Somalia (SOM) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) South Sudan (SSD) | 2 | 0 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) East Timor (TLS) [I] | 5 | 3 | 8\n |\n| ![](image) Tuvalu (TUV) | 4 | 0 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Vanuatu (VAN) | 9 | 0 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Yemen (YEM) [YEM] | 8 | 0 | 8\n |\n| *![](image) Korea (COR)* | 0 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *![Federation of Malaya](image) Malaya (MAL)* [MAL] | 2 | 0 | 2\n |\n| *![](image) North Borneo (NBO)* [NBO] | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| *![](image) Republic of China (ROC)* [ROC] | 3 | 0 | 3\n |\n| *![](image) Saar (SAA)* [SAA] | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| *![](image) North Yemen (YAR)* [YAR] | 2 | 0 | 2\n |\n| *![](image) South Yemen (YMD)* [YMD] | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| *![](image) Refugee Olympic Team (ROT)* [ROT] | 2 | 0 | 2\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Tejbir Bura was the first and only Nepalese person to receive an Olympic gold medal.

combined, German athletes also won the most gold medals in the 1976 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Variations[edit]\n\n\n### Early Olympics[edit]\n\n\nFor the 1900 Summer Olympics several countries are credited with appearances that are not considered official by the IOC. Only one of these cases concerns a medal. A gold medal that is officially added to France's total is given to Luxembourg.[4]\n\n\nOther differences from the official table are based on disagreements about which events were Olympic. This affects several of the events in the 1900 and 1904 Olympics. In addition, some sources include the 1906 Intercalated Games when compiling their medal tables.[5]\n\n\n\n### Alpinism and aeronautics[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1924 through 1936, the IOC on several occasions awarded gold medals for feats of alpinism and aeronautics that occurred in the preceding four-year Olympiad. In 1924, 1932 and 1936, gold medals were awarded to 25 mountaineers from six nations for expeditions in the Himalayas and the Matterhorn. In 1936, a gold medal was awarded to Hermann Schreiber of Switzerland for crossing the Alps in a glider in 1935, the first time that had been done.[2][6][7][8] Some sources include these IOC awards of gold medals in the overall count.\n\n\n\n### Australasia[edit]\n\n\nAustralasia was a combined team of athletes from Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand that competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics. When the Olympic Games resumed in 1920 after World War I, the two nations sent separate teams to the Games, and have done so ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1904 | ![](image) Australia (AUS) |  |\n| 1908–1912 | ![](image) Australasia (ANZ) |\n| 1920– | ![](image) Australia (AUS) | ![](image) New Zealand (NZL) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Winter Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Australasia (ANZ) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Australia (AUS) | 27 | 164 | 173 | 210 | 547 | 20 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 19 | 47 | 170 | 180 | 216 | 566\n |\n| ![](image) New Zealand (NZL) | 24 | 53 | 33 | 51 | 137 | 17 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 41 | 55 | 35 | 53 | 143\n |\n| Total\n | 29 | 220 | 210 | 266 | 696 | 20 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 25 | 49 | 228 | 219 | 274 | 721\n |\n\n\n### British West Indies[edit]\n\n\nThe West Indies Federation,[9][10] also known as the West Indies,[11][12] the Federation of the West Indies[13] or the West Indian Federation,[14][15][16] was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. Various islands in the Caribbean that were part of the British Empire, including Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and those on the Leeward and Windward Islands, came together to form the Federation.The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state[17]\nBefore that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed or function viably.\n\n\nAthletes from the West Indies Federation competed under the name Antilles (ANT),[18] \nrenamed to British West Indies (BWI) by the IOC, at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. Thirteen competitors—two from Barbados, four from Trinidad, and seven from Jamaica—all men, took part in thirteen events in five sports.[19] The short-lived nation only participated at these single Games, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago competed independently again in 1964, and Barbados started competing at the 1968 Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1948–1956 | ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) |  |\n| 1960 | ![](image) British West Indies (BWI) |\n| 1964 | ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) |  |\n| 1968– | ![](image) Barbados (BAR) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Winter Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) British West Indies (BWI) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | 18 | 26 | 36 | 26 | 88 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 27 | 26 | 36 | 26 | 88\n |\n| ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) | 18 | 3 | 5 | 11 | 19 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 22 | 3 | 5 | 11 | 19\n |\n| ![](image) Barbados (BAR) | 13 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n |\n| Total\n | 18 | 29 | 41 | 40 | 110 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 27 | 29 | 41 | 40 | 110\n |\n\n\n### Czechoslovakia[edit]\n\n\nCzechoslovakia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920, after having competed as Bohemia from 1900 to 1912. The nation sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1984 Games when they were part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics. Czechoslovakia has participated in every Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games of 1924.\n\n\nAfter the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia sent independent teams to the Olympics starting in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1896 |  | *as part of ![](image) Hungary* |\n| 1900–1912 | *as ![](image) Bohemia (BOH)* |\n| 1920–1992 | **![](image) Czechoslovakia (TCH)** |\n| 1996– | ![](image) Czech Republic (CZE) | ![](image) Slovakia (SVK) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Bohemia (BOH) | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Czechoslovakia (TCH) | 16 | 49 | 49 | 45 | 143 | 16 | 2 | 8 | 15 | 25 | 32 | 51 | 57 | 60 | 168\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic (CZE) | 7 | 19 | 22 | 26 | 67 | 8 | 10 | 11 | 13 | 34 | 15 | 29 | 33 | 39 | 101\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia (SVK) | 7 | 10 | 14 | 8 | 32 | 8 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 10 | 15 | 14 | 18 | 10 | 42\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 78 | 86 | 82 | 246 | 24 | 16 | 23 | 30 | 69 | 50 | 94 | 109 | 112 | 315\n |\n\n\n### Germany[edit]\n\n\nGermany has competed under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games. Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams. The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the updated medal totals from the main table. A part of Germany, Saar, competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals. Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it's possible but not certain Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations. Germany was denied participation on three occasions (1920, 1924, and 1948).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1896–1912 | **![German Empire](image) Germany (GER)** |\n| 1920–1924 | *denied participation* |\n| 1928–1936 | **![Weimar Republic](image) ![Nazi Germany](image) Germany (GER)** |\n| 1948 | *denied participation* |\n| 1952 | ![](image) Saar (SAA) | ![](image) Germany (GER) |\n| 1956–1964 | ![](image) United Team of Germany (EUA) |\n| 1968–1988 | ![](image) West Germany (FRG) | ![](image) East Germany (GDR) |\n| 1992– | **![](image) Germany (GER)** |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) Germany (GER) | 17 | 201 | 207 | 247 | 655 | 13 | 104 | 98 | 65 | 267 | 30 | 305 | 305 | 312 | 922\n |\n| ![](image) Saar (SAA) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) United Team of Germany (EUA) | 3 | 28 | 54 | 36 | 118 | 3 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 19 | 6 | 36 | 60 | 41 | 137\n |\n| ![](image) East Germany (GDR) | 5 | 153 | 129 | 127 | 409 | 6 | 39 | 36 | 35 | 110 | 11 | 192 | 165 | 162 | 519\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany (FRG) | 5 | 56 | 67 | 81 | 204 | 6 | 11 | 15 | 13 | 39 | 11 | 67 | 82 | 94 | 243\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 438 | 457 | 491 | 1386 | 22 | 162 | 155 | 118 | 435 | 48 | 600 | 612 | 609 | 1821\n |\n\n\n### Kuwait[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics nine athletes from Kuwait competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA), as the Kuwait Olympic Committee had been suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the second time in five years due to governmental interference.[20][21][22]\nAlthough not allowed to compete as a sovereign state at the 2016 Summer Olympics, the nation's participants were able to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes under the Olympic flag.

Between 1952 until 1984, Aruban athletes competed as part of the Netherlands Antilles. Since the Olympic Games in 1988, athletes from Aruba have competed separately under their own Olympic banner and have participated in each Summer Olympic Games since then.\n\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba became part of the Netherlands as special municipalities of the Netherlands. Curaçao and Sint Maarten became separate constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. \nAt the 2012 Olympics, participants from the five islands competed as independent athletes under the Olympic flag.\nHowever, athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles who qualified for the 2012 Olympics were allowed to participate independently under the Olympic flag, in addition to the possibility of competing for the Netherlands (as for example Churandy Martina did) or Aruba (because they have Dutch nationality).[24] Ultimately, three athletes from the Netherlands Antilles participated as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1948 | ![](image) Netherlands (NED) |  |\n| 1952–1984 | ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) |\n| 1988–2008 | ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) | ![](image) Aruba (ARU) |\n| 2012 | *as part of ![](image) Netherlands* / ![](image) Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA) (2012) |\n| 2014– | ![](image) Netherlands (NED) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands (NED) | 27 | 95 | 105 | 122 | 322 | 22 | 53 | 49 | 45 | 147 | 49 | 148 | 154 | 167 | 469\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) | 13 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Aruba (ARU) | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA) (2012) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total\n | 27 | 95 | 106 | 122 | 323 | 22 | 53 | 49 | 45 | 147 | 49 | 148 | 155 | 167 | 470\n |\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC) participated in its first Summer Olympics in 1932 under the name of *China*. After the Chinese Civil War, the ROC retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949, and only Taiwan-based athletes have competed on its behalf since then. In 1971, the ROC was expelled from the United Nations, but was permitted to compete under its official name, flag, and anthem in the 1972 Winter, 1972 Summer, and 1976 Winter Olympics. It was denied official representation in the 1976 Summer Olympics and boycotted it as a result. The 1979 Nagoya Resolution allowed the ROC to compete under the deliberately-ambiguous name \"Chinese Taipei\"; it protested against this decision and boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics as well, but has competed under this name since the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nThe Republic of China took part in the Opening Ceremony of the 1924 Summer Olympics, but its four athletes, all of whom were tennis players, withdrew from competition.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1924–1948 | **![](image) Republic of China (ROC)** |\n| 1952 | ![](image) China (CHN) |  |\n| 1956– | ![](image) Chinese Taipei (TPE) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of China (ROC) | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) China (CHN) | 11 | 263 | 199 | 174 | 636 | 12 | 22 | 32 | 23 | 77 | 23 | 285 | 231 | 197 | 713\n |\n| ![](image) Chinese Taipei (TPE) | 15 | 7 | 11 | 18 | 36 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 28 | 7 | 11 | 18 | 36\n |\n| Total\n | 19 | 270 | 210 | 192 | 672 | 14 | 22 | 32 | 23 | 77 | 33 | 292 | 242 | 215 | 749\n |\n\n\n### Russia and the Soviet Union[edit]\n\n\nThe Russian Federation, the Russian Empire, the Olympic Athletes from Russia and the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) are sometimes combined outside of IOC sources. The Soviet Union is often combined with the post-union team that competed in 1992.[26][27][28] Some sources combine the Soviet Union and Russia, despite the fact that many republics which subsequently gained or re-gained independence (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) contributed to the medal tally of the USSR, and there are sources that combine all medals of RU1, URS, EUN, OAR, ROC and RUS.[29][30] On 31 January 1992, the United Nations recognized, without objection, Russia as legal successor of the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union,[31] but this has no significance in medal tallies.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1912 |

Yugoslavia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920. *Yugoslavia* has been the designation for Olympic teams from three distinct national entities:\n\n\n\n* Kingdom of Yugoslavia (officially called the *Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes* until 1929) from 1920–1936\n* Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1948 to the 1992 Winter Olympics\n* Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, formed as a joint state by only Montenegro and Serbia after the breakup of Yugoslavia, from 1996 to 2002\n\n\nThe United Nations[32] affirmed that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had ceased to exist, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was a new state. All former republics were entitled to state succession, while none of them continued SFR Yugoslavia's international legal personality. As a result of the U.N. resolution, individual FRY athletes were allowed to compete as Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and FRY was not allowed to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nThe *Federal Republic of Yugoslavia*, consisting of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games since 1996. At the 1996[33] and 2000[34] Games, the nation was designated with the same code, *Yugoslavia* (YUG), as the defunct SFRY. It was rechartered as the *State Union of Serbia and Montenegro* in 2003 with there being no territorial changes. The *Serbia and Montenegro* (SCG) designation and code were used at the 2004 Games.[35]\n\n\nTwo of the successor nations (Croatia and Slovenia) began to compete as independent teams at the Olympics starting at the 1992 Winter Games and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 1992 Summer Games and as of the 2008 Summer Olympics, all six successor nations, former socialist republics, have participated independently. Kosovo, a former autonomous province, made its Olympic debut as an independent national team at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1912 | *as part of ![](image) Austria* |  | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) |  |\n| 1920–1936 | ![Kingdom of Yugoslavia](image) Kingdom of Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1948–1988 | ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) SFR Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1992 W | ![](image) Croatia (CRO) | ![](image) Slovenia (SLO) | ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) SFR Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1992 S | ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) | ![](image) Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) |\n| 1994 | *ban on participation by the UN* |\n| 1996–2006 | ![](image) North Macedonia (MKD) | ![Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) FR Yugoslavia (YUG)/![](image) Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) |\n| 2008–2014 | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) | ![](image) Montenegro (MNE) |\n| 2016– | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) | ![](image) Kosovo (KOS) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) Serbia (SRB) (1912, 2008–current) | 5 | 6 | 7 | 11 | 24 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 6 | 7 | 11 | 24\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) Yugoslavia (YUG) (1920–1992 *w*) | 16 | 26 | 29 | 28 | 83 | 14 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 30 | 26 | 32 | 29 | 87\n |\n| ![](image) Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) (1992 *s*) | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) (1996–2006) | 3 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 9 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia (CRO) (1992–current) | 8 | 14 | 13 | 14 | 41 | 9 | 4 | 6 | 1 | 11 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 15 | 52\n |\n| ![](image) Slovenia (SLO) (1992–current) | 8 | 8 | 9 | 11 | 28 | 9 | 4 | 8 | 12 | 24 | 17 | 12 | 17 | 23 | 52\n |\n| ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) (1992 *s* –current) | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 16 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) North Macedonia (MKD) (1996–current) | 7 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 14 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Montenegro (MNE) (2008–current) | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Kosovo (KOS) (2016–current) | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3\n |\n| Total\n | 25 | 59 | 65 | 70 | 194 | 22 | 8 | 17 | 14 | 39 | 47 | 67 | 82 | 84 | 233\n |\n\n\n### Others[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the teams of Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games mentioned above—Kuwait, Russia, the former Netherlands Antilles, and the former Yugoslavia—several other NOCs were represented by independent Olympic athletes.

The *West Indies Federation* only existed as a nation from 1958–1962, so the constituent nations once again competed independently in 1964.\n* **SAA** , **EUA** , **GDR** , **FRG** → **GER** Germany (GER) competed 1896–1952 and from 1992. Due to the partition of Germany after World War II, Germany was represented by two teams at the 1952 Games — Germany (GER) and the *Saar* (SAA). The Saar was reintegrated back into the Federal Republic of Germany on 1 January 1957, and Saar athletes then competed for Germany. *East Germany* did not contribute athletes to the 1952 team, as the National Olympic Committee for the German Democratic Republic was only granted \"provisional\" recognition by the IOC in 1955. For the Games of 1956–1964, Germany participated as a *United Team of Germany* (EUA), representing the National Olympic Committees of both *West Germany* and *East Germany*. Retrospectively, the IOC uses the country code EUA for this team. After the NOC for the German Democratic Republic was granted full recognition by the IOC in 1968, *East Germany* (GDR) and *West Germany* (FRG) competed as two independent teams from the 1968 to the 1988 Games.\n* **MAL** , **NBO** → **MAS** Athletes from *Malaya* (MAL) and *North Borneo* (NBO) competed as independent teams at the 1956 Games and Malaya also competed at the 1960 Games, prior to the formation of the Federation of Malaysia (MAS) in 1963.\n* **AHO** The *Netherlands Antilles* (AHO), an autonomous country within the Netherlands (NED), competed 1952–2008. The Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee's membership in the IOC was withdrawn in 2011 because of the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.\n* **RU1** → **URS** → **EUN** → **RUS** *Russian Empire* (RU1) participated at the 1900, 1908 and 1912 Games prior to World War I. The *Soviet Union* (URS) competed from 1952 to 1988. *Unified Team* (EUN) is the generic name used for a combined team of six post-Soviet republics that competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics and a combined team of twelve post-Soviet republics that competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics. *Russian Federation* (RUS) and the other fourteen post-Soviet republics started competing independently in 1992 (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia), 1994 or 1996.\n | * **SRB** , **YUG to 1992** , **YUG/SCG** Serbia (SRB, 1912, 2006–current) first participated at the Olympic Games in 1912. *Yugoslavia* (YUG, 1920–1992 Winter) competed as *Kingdom of Yugoslavia* (officially the *Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes* until 1929) in five Games (1920–1936) before the Second World War. They later competed as *Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia* for the Games (1948–1992 Winter). This ended with the breakup of Yugoslavia. Some ex-Yugoslavian nations (Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina) have competed as independent teams since 1992. Individual athletes from the *Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)* competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP) at the 1992 Summer Games because of sanctions placed by the United Nations. Athletes representing Macedonia likewise competed as Independent Olympic Participants that year because their NOC had not yet been formed, but since 1996 Macedonia has competed as an independent team. The team of the *State Union of Serbia and Montenegro* (SCG, 2004–2006) consisted of Serbia and Montenegro, until 2006 when Montenegro seceded from the Union. This team competed as *Yugoslavia* (YUG) from 1996–2002 and then changed to *Serbia and Montenegro* (2004–2006). After 96 years Serbia returned to the Olympics as an independent team at the 2008 Games. Montenegro first participated as an independent team in 2008.\n* **YAR** , **YMD** → **YEM** Prior to Yemeni unification in 1990, *North Yemen* participated as the *Yemen Arab Republic* (YAR) in 1984 and 1988, and *South Yemen* participated as the *Yemen Democratic Republic* (YMD) at the 1988 Games. After forming united republic Yemen (YEM) has participated since 1992.\n* **ROC** → **CHN** , **TPE** The *Republic of China* was designated as *China* at the 1932, 1936, and 1948 Games and was representing all of China (including Taiwan). After the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China (CHN) and Chinese Taipei (TPE) have participated as separate teams.\n* **ZZX** Special code used by the IOC to refer to medals won by athletes of multiple nations competing together, which was common in early Games (1896–1904). These medals are not included in the respective totals for each nation represented by individual mixed team athletes.\n* **IOP** , **IOA** , **OAR** , **ROC** Special codes used by the IOC for athletes whose NOC is not recognized by IOC. At the 1992 Summer Olympics fifty eight athletes from former Yugoslavia competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP). At the 2000 Summer Olympics four athletes from East Timor competed as *Individual Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2012 Summer Olympics three athletes from former Netherlands Antilles and one athlete from South Sudan competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2014 Winter Olympics three athletes from India competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP). At the 2016 Summer Olympics nine athletes from Kuwait competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2018 Winter Olympics 168 athletes from Russia competed as *Olympics Athletes from Russia* (OAR). Since the 2020 Summer Olympics athletes from Russia are competing as *Russian Olympic Committee* (ROC).\n\n\n |\n\n### Name changes notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **BIZ** Belize participated under its former name of *British Honduras* (HBR) in 1968 and 1972.\n* **BEN** Benin was known as *Dahomey* (DAH) in 1972.\n* **BUR** Burkina Faso was known as *Upper Volta* (VOL) in 1972.\n* **TPE2** After the Chinese Civil War, Chinese Taipei (TPE) participated using the name of the *Republic of China* at the 1956, 1960, 1972 and 1976 (winter) Games and using *Taiwan* designation at the 1964 and 1968 Games. In 1979, the IOC started to use *Chinese Taipei* to refer to the NOC, a compromise that was acceptable for the People's Republic of China (CHN) that led to the start of its participation in the Olympic Games. The name Chinese Taipei was first used in 1984. Participation of the *Republic of China*, representing all of China (including Taiwan), in 1932, 1936 and 1948 Games are not counted in Taiwan's total participation count.\n* **COD** The Democratic Republic of the Congo was known as *Zaire* (ZAI) between 1984 and 1996.\n* **CIV** Côte d'Ivoire was known as *Ivory Coast* between 1964 and 1988.\n* **EGY** Egypt participated as the *United Arab Republic* (UAR) between 1960 and 1968.\n* **GBR** Includes medals won by athletes from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1896–1920) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1924–present), both of which used the name \"Great Britain\" and the country code GBR.\n | * **GHA** Prior to Ghana's independence in 1957, *Gold Coast* participated in the 1952 Games.\n* **GUY** Prior to Guyana's independence in 1966, *British Guiana* participated from 1948 to 1964.\n* **HKG** Totals of Hong Kong (HKG) includes all medals won by athletes representing the Hong Kong National Olympic Committee, designated as \"Hong Kong\" from 1952–1996 and \"Hong Kong, China\" since 2000.\n* **MKD** North Macedonia was known as *Macedonia*, or more formally *the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* due to a naming dispute with Greece, between 1996 and 2018.\n* **MYA** Myanmar was known as *Burma* (BIR) between 1948 and 1988.\n* **SAM** Samoa was known as *Western Samoa* between 1984 and 1996.\n* **SRI** Sri Lanka was known as *Ceylon* (CEY) between 1948 and 1972.\n* **SWZ** Eswatini was known as *Swaziland* between 1972 and 2016.\n* **TAN** Although Tanganyika and Zanzibar had already merged to form Tanzania in April 1964, the nation was designated *Tanganyika* in the official report of the 1964 Games.\n* **ZAM** Zambia achieved independence on the last day of the 1964 Games, but had participated as *Northern Rhodesia* (NRH) during those Games.\n* **ZIM** Prior to Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, *Southern Rhodesia* participated as *Rhodesia* (RHO) in 1928, 1960, and 1964 Games.\n\n\n |\n\n### Participation notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **A** Brunei's participation in the 1988 Games consisted only of a single official, but no competing athletes. This participation is not counted in Brunei's participation total.\n* **B** Djibouti at the 2004 Games took part in the Opening Ceremony, but neither athlete competed, so this participation is not counted in Djibouti's participation total.\n* **C** Liberia's athletes withdrew from 1980 Games after marching in the Opening Ceremony and took part in the boycott. This participation is not counted in Liberia's participation total.\n* **D** Libya marched in the opening ceremony of the 1964 Games, but then withdrew from competition. This participation is not counted in Libya's participation total.\n* **E** Suriname at the 1960 Games took part in the Opening Ceremony, but its lone athlete withdrew from Games due to a scheduling error. Participation of Suriname at the 1960 Games not recognized by IOC, so this participation is not counted in Suriname's participation total.\n | * **F** India's athletes originally competed at the 2014 Games as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic Flag during the opening ceremony due to the Indian Olympic Association's suspension. On February 11, 2014, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward.\n* **Ia** **Ib** Does not include the participation of East Timor's and Netherlands Antilles's athletes as *Individual Olympic Athletes* (IOA) at the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n* **Za** **Zb** **Zc** **Zd** **Ze** **Zf** **Zg** **Zh** **Zi** **Zj** **Zk** **Zl** **Zm** Does not include medals won as part of mixed teams with athletes from other nations (1896–1904).\n\n\n |\n\n### Disputed participation notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **H** The Bulgarian Olympic Committee claims that Charles Champaud, a Swiss gymnastics teacher living in Sofia, competed for the nation in 1896. Bulgarian participation at the 1896 Games is recognized by the IOC.\n* **I** The Chilean Olympic Committee claims that Luis Subercaseaux Errázuriz, a Chilean diplomat and athlete, competed for the nation in 1896. Chilean participation at the 1896 Games is recognized by the IOC.\n* **J** Some sources consider Léon Thiércelin, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Haitian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Haiti. Participation of Haiti at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Haiti's participation total.\n* **K** Some sources consider Freydoun Malkom, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Persian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Iran. Participation of Iran at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Iran's participation total.\n* **L** Some sources consider Carlos de Candamo, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Peruvian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Peru. Participation of Peru at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Peru's participation total.\n* **M** Enrico Brusoni's gold medal in the Cycling Men's Points Race at the 1900 Summer Olympics[36] is recognized by the Italian National Olympic Committee as well as the IOC[37] as being won in a 1900 Summer Olympics event, although some sources state it was unofficial.[38]\n* **N** Monaco earned a bronze in the art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics.[39] However, medals in art competitions are no longer recognized by the IOC.[40]\n* **Oa** **Ob** Michel Théato, a French athlete who won the gold medal in marathon at the 1900 Games, was born in Luxembourg.[4] The IOC does not recognize Luxembourg participation at the 1900 Games and attributes his medal to France.\n | The nationalities of many medalists at the 1904 Olympics are disputed as many competitors were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted US citizenship.\n* **Pa** **Pb** Sources are inconsistent regarding Albert Corey's participation in 1904, who immigrated to the United States from France. The Games report refers to Corey as a \"Frenchman wearing the colors of the Chicago Athletic Association\", but the IOC attributes his medal in the marathon to the United States, and in contradiction, the medal in the four mile team race (that was won by a team of three Americans and Corey) to a mixed team composed of athletes from multiple nations instead of just the United States.[41]\n* **Qa** **Qb** The International Olympic Committee considers Norwegian-American wrestlers Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen who immigrated from Norway to the United States to have competed for the United States. Each man won a gold medal.[42] In 2012, Norwegian historians however found documentation showing that Ericksen did not receive American citizenship until March 22, 1905, and that Hansen, who was registered as an \"alien\" (foreigner) as late as 1925, probably never received American citizenship. The historians have therefore petitioned the IOC to have the athletes registered as Norwegians.[43][44] In May 2013 it was reported that the Norwegian Olympic Committee had filed a formal application for changing the nationality of the wrestlers in the IOC's medal database.[45]\n* **R** Bob Fowler, an American marathon runner who competed at the 1904 Games, was a native Newfoundlander, Newfoundland is occasionally listed as a separate country at the 1904 Olympics, and would be listed as an historical NOC without medals.[46] Participation of Newfoundland at the 1904 Games is not recognized by the IOC.\n* **S** In 2009, historians from the International Society of Olympic Historians discovered that cyclist Frank Bizzoni was an Italian citizen when he competed in 1904 being granted US citizenship in 1917.[47][48] However, the IOC does not officially recognize Italy's participation in the 1904 Olympics.\n* **Fm** The IOC counts one gold, one silver, and two bronze medals won by American fencer Albertson Van Zo Post for Cuba instead of the United States. The one silver and one bronze medal won by American Charles Tatham are also counted for Cuba instead of the United States.\n\n\n |\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* All-time Paralympic Games medal table\n* All-time Youth Olympic Games medal table\n* Olympic medal table\n* List of first Olympic gold medalists by country\n* List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games\n* List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n* List of Olympic teams by medals won\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Olympic Games - Sochi 2014 | Winter Summer Past and Future Olympics\".

These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.\nThe IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes unofficial tables only per single Games. This table was thus compiled by adding up single entries from the IOC database.[1]\n\n\nThe results are attributed to the IOC country code as currently displayed by the IOC database. Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors.\n\n\n\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Summer Olympic medals.\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Winter Olympic medals.\n\n## List of NOCs with medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\nThe table is pre-sorted by the name of each Olympic Committee, but can be displayed as sorted by any other column, such as the total number of gold medals or total number of overall medals. To sort by gold, silver, and then bronze, sort first by the bronze column, then the silver, and then the gold. The table does not count revoked medals (e.g., due to doping).\n\n\nA total of 156 current and historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 5 May 2023 are taken into account.\n\n\n\nSpecial delegation, not an actual nation\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Summer Olympic Games | Winter Olympic Games | Combined total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team

are not equal for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Some sports (such as boxing, judo, taekwondo, and wrestling) award or have previously awarded two bronze medals per competition.\n* Team sports medals, such as in football or basketball count as one, even if there are multiple players on each team, who get a medal.\n* Some tied performances have resulted in multiple medals of the same colour being awarded for an event. If this tie is for gold or silver, there will be a consequent absence of a silver or bronze medal for that event.\n* Some medals that have been revoked have not been re-awarded.\n* Some early events, such as cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics, had only two entrants.\n* Retroactively awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals for the 1896 and 1900 games results in some anomalies, such as the 100 metre freestyle swimming event in 1896 where no surviving records distinguish the places of those who finished between 3rd and 10th position.\n\n\n## List of NOCs without medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, 68 of the current 206 National Olympic Committees have yet to win an Olympic medal.

combined, German athletes also won the most gold medals in the 1976 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Variations[edit]\n\n\n### Early Olympics[edit]\n\n\nFor the 1900 Summer Olympics several countries are credited with appearances that are not considered official by the IOC. Only one of these cases concerns a medal. A gold medal that is officially added to France's total is given to Luxembourg.[4]\n\n\nOther differences from the official table are based on disagreements about which events were Olympic. This affects several of the events in the 1900 and 1904 Olympics. In addition, some sources include the 1906 Intercalated Games when compiling their medal tables.[5]\n\n\n\n### Alpinism and aeronautics[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1924 through 1936, the IOC on several occasions awarded gold medals for feats of alpinism and aeronautics that occurred in the preceding four-year Olympiad. In 1924, 1932 and 1936, gold medals were awarded to 25 mountaineers from six nations for expeditions in the Himalayas and the Matterhorn. In 1936, a gold medal was awarded to Hermann Schreiber of Switzerland for crossing the Alps in a glider in 1935, the first time that had been done.[2][6][7][8] Some sources include these IOC awards of gold medals in the overall count.\n\n\n\n### Australasia[edit]\n\n\nAustralasia was a combined team of athletes from Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand that competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics. When the Olympic Games resumed in 1920 after World War I, the two nations sent separate teams to the Games, and have done so ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1904 | ![](image) Australia (AUS) |  |\n| 1908–1912 | ![](image) Australasia (ANZ) |\n| 1920– | ![](image) Australia (AUS) | ![](image) New Zealand (NZL) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Winter Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Australasia (ANZ) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Australia (AUS) | 27 | 164 | 173 | 210 | 547 | 20 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 19 | 47 | 170 | 180 | 216 | 566\n |\n| ![](image) New Zealand (NZL) | 24 | 53 | 33 | 51 | 137 | 17 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 41 | 55 | 35 | 53 | 143\n |\n| Total\n | 29 | 220 | 210 | 266 | 696 | 20 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 25 | 49 | 228 | 219 | 274 | 721\n |\n\n\n### British West Indies[edit]\n\n\nThe West Indies Federation,[9][10] also known as the West Indies,[11][12] the Federation of the West Indies[13] or the West Indian Federation,[14][15][16] was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. Various islands in the Caribbean that were part of the British Empire, including Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and those on the Leeward and Windward Islands, came together to form the Federation.The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state[17]\nBefore that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed or function viably.\n\n\nAthletes from the West Indies Federation competed under the name Antilles (ANT),[18] \nrenamed to British West Indies (BWI) by the IOC, at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. Thirteen competitors—two from Barbados, four from Trinidad, and seven from Jamaica—all men, took part in thirteen events in five sports.[19] The short-lived nation only participated at these single Games, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago competed independently again in 1964, and Barbados started competing at the 1968 Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1948–1956 | ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) |  |\n| 1960 | ![](image) British West Indies (BWI) |\n| 1964 | ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) |  |\n| 1968– | ![](image) Barbados (BAR) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Winter Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) British West Indies (BWI) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | 18 | 26 | 36 | 26 | 88 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 27 | 26 | 36 | 26 | 88\n |\n| ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) | 18 | 3 | 5 | 11 | 19 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 22 | 3 | 5 | 11 | 19\n |\n| ![](image) Barbados (BAR) | 13 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n |\n| Total\n | 18 | 29 | 41 | 40 | 110 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 27 | 29 | 41 | 40 | 110\n |\n\n\n### Czechoslovakia[edit]\n\n\nCzechoslovakia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920, after having competed as Bohemia from 1900 to 1912. The nation sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1984 Games when they were part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics. Czechoslovakia has participated in every Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games of 1924.\n\n\nAfter the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia sent independent teams to the Olympics starting in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1896 |  | *as part of ![](image) Hungary* |\n| 1900–1912 | *as ![](image) Bohemia (BOH)* |\n| 1920–1992 | **![](image) Czechoslovakia (TCH)** |\n| 1996– | ![](image) Czech Republic (CZE) | ![](image) Slovakia (SVK) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Bohemia (BOH) | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Czechoslovakia (TCH) | 16 | 49 | 49 | 45 | 143 | 16 | 2 | 8 | 15 | 25 | 32 | 51 | 57 | 60 | 168\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic (CZE) | 7 | 19 | 22 | 26 | 67 | 8 | 10 | 11 | 13 | 34 | 15 | 29 | 33 | 39 | 101\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia (SVK) | 7 | 10 | 14 | 8 | 32 | 8 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 10 | 15 | 14 | 18 | 10 | 42\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 78 | 86 | 82 | 246 | 24 | 16 | 23 | 30 | 69 | 50 | 94 | 109 | 112 | 315\n |\n\n\n### Germany[edit]\n\n\nGermany has competed under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games. Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams. The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the updated medal totals from the main table. A part of Germany, Saar, competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals. Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it's possible but not certain Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations. Germany was denied participation on three occasions (1920, 1924, and 1948).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1896–1912 | **![German Empire](image) Germany (GER)** |\n| 1920–1924 | *denied participation* |\n| 1928–1936 | **![Weimar Republic](image) ![Nazi Germany](image) Germany (GER)** |\n| 1948 | *denied participation* |\n| 1952 | ![](image) Saar (SAA) | ![](image) Germany (GER) |\n| 1956–1964 | ![](image) United Team of Germany (EUA) |\n| 1968–1988 | ![](image) West Germany (FRG) | ![](image) East Germany (GDR) |\n| 1992– | **![](image) Germany (GER)** |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) Germany (GER) | 17 | 201 | 207 | 247 | 655 | 13 | 104 | 98 | 65 | 267 | 30 | 305 | 305 | 312 | 922\n |\n| ![](image) Saar (SAA) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) United Team of Germany (EUA) | 3 | 28 | 54 | 36 | 118 | 3 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 19 | 6 | 36 | 60 | 41 | 137\n |\n| ![](image) East Germany (GDR) | 5 | 153 | 129 | 127 | 409 | 6 | 39 | 36 | 35 | 110 | 11 | 192 | 165 | 162 | 519\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany (FRG) | 5 | 56 | 67 | 81 | 204 | 6 | 11 | 15 | 13 | 39 | 11 | 67 | 82 | 94 | 243\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 438 | 457 | 491 | 1386 | 22 | 162 | 155 | 118 | 435 | 48 | 600 | 612 | 609 | 1821\n |\n\n\n### Kuwait[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics nine athletes from Kuwait competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA), as the Kuwait Olympic Committee had been suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the second time in five years due to governmental interference.[20][21][22]\nAlthough not allowed to compete as a sovereign state at the 2016 Summer Olympics, the nation's participants were able to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes under the Olympic flag.

Between 1952 until 1984, Aruban athletes competed as part of the Netherlands Antilles. Since the Olympic Games in 1988, athletes from Aruba have competed separately under their own Olympic banner and have participated in each Summer Olympic Games since then.\n\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba became part of the Netherlands as special municipalities of the Netherlands. Curaçao and Sint Maarten became separate constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. \nAt the 2012 Olympics, participants from the five islands competed as independent athletes under the Olympic flag.\nHowever, athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles who qualified for the 2012 Olympics were allowed to participate independently under the Olympic flag, in addition to the possibility of competing for the Netherlands (as for example Churandy Martina did) or Aruba (because they have Dutch nationality).[24] Ultimately, three athletes from the Netherlands Antilles participated as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1948 | ![](image) Netherlands (NED) |  |\n| 1952–1984 | ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) |\n| 1988–2008 | ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) | ![](image) Aruba (ARU) |\n| 2012 | *as part of ![](image) Netherlands* / ![](image) Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA) (2012) |\n| 2014– | ![](image) Netherlands (NED) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands (NED) | 27 | 95 | 105 | 122 | 322 | 22 | 53 | 49 | 45 | 147 | 49 | 148 | 154 | 167 | 469\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) | 13 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Aruba (ARU) | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA) (2012) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total\n | 27 | 95 | 106 | 122 | 323 | 22 | 53 | 49 | 45 | 147 | 49 | 148 | 155 | 167 | 470\n |\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC) participated in its first Summer Olympics in 1932 under the name of *China*. After the Chinese Civil War, the ROC retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949, and only Taiwan-based athletes have competed on its behalf since then. In 1971, the ROC was expelled from the United Nations, but was permitted to compete under its official name, flag, and anthem in the 1972 Winter, 1972 Summer, and 1976 Winter Olympics. It was denied official representation in the 1976 Summer Olympics and boycotted it as a result. The 1979 Nagoya Resolution allowed the ROC to compete under the deliberately-ambiguous name \"Chinese Taipei\"; it protested against this decision and boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics as well, but has competed under this name since the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nThe Republic of China took part in the Opening Ceremony of the 1924 Summer Olympics, but its four athletes, all of whom were tennis players, withdrew from competition.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1924–1948 | **![](image) Republic of China (ROC)** |\n| 1952 | ![](image) China (CHN) |  |\n| 1956– | ![](image) Chinese Taipei (TPE) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of China (ROC) | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) China (CHN) | 11 | 263 | 199 | 174 | 636 | 12 | 22 | 32 | 23 | 77 | 23 | 285 | 231 | 197 | 713\n |\n| ![](image) Chinese Taipei (TPE) | 15 | 7 | 11 | 18 | 36 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 28 | 7 | 11 | 18 | 36\n |\n| Total\n | 19 | 270 | 210 | 192 | 672 | 14 | 22 | 32 | 23 | 77 | 33 | 292 | 242 | 215 | 749\n |\n\n\n### Russia and the Soviet Union[edit]\n\n\nThe Russian Federation, the Russian Empire, the Olympic Athletes from Russia and the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) are sometimes combined outside of IOC sources. The Soviet Union is often combined with the post-union team that competed in 1992.[26][27][28] Some sources combine the Soviet Union and Russia, despite the fact that many republics which subsequently gained or re-gained independence (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) contributed to the medal tally of the USSR, and there are sources that combine all medals of RU1, URS, EUN, OAR, ROC and RUS.[29][30] On 31 January 1992, the United Nations recognized, without objection, Russia as legal successor of the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union,[31] but this has no significance in medal tallies.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1912 |

Yugoslavia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920. *Yugoslavia* has been the designation for Olympic teams from three distinct national entities:\n\n\n\n* Kingdom of Yugoslavia (officially called the *Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes* until 1929) from 1920–1936\n* Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1948 to the 1992 Winter Olympics\n* Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, formed as a joint state by only Montenegro and Serbia after the breakup of Yugoslavia, from 1996 to 2002\n\n\nThe United Nations[32] affirmed that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had ceased to exist, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was a new state. All former republics were entitled to state succession, while none of them continued SFR Yugoslavia's international legal personality. As a result of the U.N. resolution, individual FRY athletes were allowed to compete as Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and FRY was not allowed to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nThe *Federal Republic of Yugoslavia*, consisting of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games since 1996. At the 1996[33] and 2000[34] Games, the nation was designated with the same code, *Yugoslavia* (YUG), as the defunct SFRY. It was rechartered as the *State Union of Serbia and Montenegro* in 2003 with there being no territorial changes. The *Serbia and Montenegro* (SCG) designation and code were used at the 2004 Games.[35]\n\n\nTwo of the successor nations (Croatia and Slovenia) began to compete as independent teams at the Olympics starting at the 1992 Winter Games and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 1992 Summer Games and as of the 2008 Summer Olympics, all six successor nations, former socialist republics, have participated independently. Kosovo, a former autonomous province, made its Olympic debut as an independent national team at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1912 | *as part of ![](image) Austria* |  | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) |  |\n| 1920–1936 | ![Kingdom of Yugoslavia](image) Kingdom of Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1948–1988 | ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) SFR Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1992 W | ![](image) Croatia (CRO) | ![](image) Slovenia (SLO) | ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) SFR Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1992 S | ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) | ![](image) Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) |\n| 1994 | *ban on participation by the UN* |\n| 1996–2006 | ![](image) North Macedonia (MKD) | ![Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) FR Yugoslavia (YUG)/![](image) Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) |\n| 2008–2014 | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) | ![](image) Montenegro (MNE) |\n| 2016– | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) | ![](image) Kosovo (KOS) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) Serbia (SRB) (1912, 2008–current) | 5 | 6 | 7 | 11 | 24 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 6 | 7 | 11 | 24\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) Yugoslavia (YUG) (1920–1992 *w*) | 16 | 26 | 29 | 28 | 83 | 14 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 30 | 26 | 32 | 29 | 87\n |\n| ![](image) Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) (1992 *s*) | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) (1996–2006) | 3 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 9 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia (CRO) (1992–current) | 8 | 14 | 13 | 14 | 41 | 9 | 4 | 6 | 1 | 11 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 15 | 52\n |\n| ![](image) Slovenia (SLO) (1992–current) | 8 | 8 | 9 | 11 | 28 | 9 | 4 | 8 | 12 | 24 | 17 | 12 | 17 | 23 | 52\n |\n| ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) (1992 *s* –current) | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 16 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) North Macedonia (MKD) (1996–current) | 7 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 14 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Montenegro (MNE) (2008–current) | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Kosovo (KOS) (2016–current) | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3\n |\n| Total\n | 25 | 59 | 65 | 70 | 194 | 22 | 8 | 17 | 14 | 39 | 47 | 67 | 82 | 84 | 233\n |\n\n\n### Others[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the teams of Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games mentioned above—Kuwait, Russia, the former Netherlands Antilles, and the former Yugoslavia—several other NOCs were represented by independent Olympic athletes. East Timor's team in 2000 consisted of four athletes competing as Individual Olympic Athletes. In 2012, one independent Olympic athlete represented South Sudan. In the 2014 Winter Olympics, the team from India included one independent Olympic participant.\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n### Obsolete nations notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **ANZ** → **AUS** , **NZL** *Australasia* (ANZ) was a combined team of athletes from Australia (AUS) and New Zealand (NZL). They competed together during the 1908 and 1912 Games.\n* **BOH** → **TCH** → **CZE** , **SVK** Prior to the foundation of *Czechoslovakia* (TCH) after World War I, athletes from *Bohemia* (BOH) (now part of the present-day Czech Republic) competed in 1900, 1908, and 1912 Games. *Czechoslovakia* competed in 1920–1992, from 1994 represented by successor NOCs of Czech Republic (CZE) and Slovakia (SVK).\n* **BWI** → **BAR** , **JAM** , **TTO** Athletes from Barbados (BAR), Jamaica (JAM), and Trinidad and Tobago (TRI) competed as the *British West Indies* (BWI) at the 1960 Games. The *West Indies Federation* only existed as a nation from 1958–1962, so the constituent nations once again competed independently in 1964.\n* **SAA** , **EUA** , **GDR** , **FRG** → **GER** Germany (GER) competed 1896–1952 and from 1992. Due to the partition of Germany after World War II, Germany was represented by two teams at the 1952 Games — Germany (GER) and the *Saar* (SAA). The Saar was reintegrated back into the Federal Republic of Germany on 1 January 1957, and Saar athletes then competed for Germany. *East Germany* did not contribute athletes to the 1952 team, as the National Olympic Committee for the German Democratic Republic was only granted \"provisional\" recognition by the IOC in 1955. For the Games of 1956–1964, Germany participated as a *United Team of Germany* (EUA), representing the National Olympic Committees of both *West Germany* and *East Germany*. Retrospectively, the IOC uses the country code EUA for this team. After the NOC for the German Democratic Republic was granted full recognition by the IOC in 1968, *East Germany* (GDR) and *West Germany* (FRG) competed as two independent teams from the 1968 to the 1988 Games.\n* **MAL** , **NBO** → **MAS** Athletes from *Malaya* (MAL) and *North Borneo* (NBO) competed as independent teams at the 1956 Games and Malaya also competed at the 1960 Games, prior to the formation of the Federation of Malaysia (MAS) in 1963.\n* **AHO** The *Netherlands Antilles* (AHO), an autonomous country within the Netherlands (NED), competed 1952–2008. The Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee's membership in the IOC was withdrawn in 2011 because of the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.\n* **RU1** → **URS** → **EUN** → **RUS** *Russian Empire* (RU1) participated at the 1900, 1908 and 1912 Games prior to World War I. The *Soviet Union* (URS) competed from 1952 to 1988. *Unified Team* (EUN) is the generic name used for a combined team of six post-Soviet republics that competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics and a combined team of twelve post-Soviet republics that competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics. *Russian Federation* (RUS) and the other fourteen post-Soviet republics started competing independently in 1992 (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia), 1994 or 1996.\n | * **SRB** , **YUG to 1992** , **YUG/SCG** Serbia (SRB, 1912, 2006–current) first participated at the Olympic Games in 1912. *Yugoslavia* (YUG, 1920–1992 Winter) competed as *Kingdom of Yugoslavia* (officially the *Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes* until 1929) in five Games (1920–1936) before the Second World War. They later competed as *Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia* for the Games (1948–1992 Winter). This ended with the breakup of Yugoslavia. Some ex-Yugoslavian nations (Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina) have competed as independent teams since 1992. Individual athletes from the *Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)* competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP) at the 1992 Summer Games because of sanctions placed by the United Nations. Athletes representing Macedonia likewise competed as Independent Olympic Participants that year because their NOC had not yet been formed, but since 1996 Macedonia has competed as an independent team. The team of the *State Union of Serbia and Montenegro* (SCG, 2004–2006) consisted of Serbia and Montenegro, until 2006 when Montenegro seceded from the Union. This team competed as *Yugoslavia* (YUG) from 1996–2002 and then changed to *Serbia and Montenegro* (2004–2006). After 96 years Serbia returned to the Olympics as an independent team at the 2008 Games. Montenegro first participated as an independent team in 2008.\n* **YAR** , **YMD** → **YEM** Prior to Yemeni unification in 1990, *North Yemen* participated as the *Yemen Arab Republic* (YAR) in 1984 and 1988, and *South Yemen* participated as the *Yemen Democratic Republic* (YMD) at the 1988 Games. After forming united republic Yemen (YEM) has participated since 1992.\n* **ROC** → **CHN** , **TPE** The *Republic of China* was designated as *China* at the 1932, 1936, and 1948 Games and was representing all of China (including Taiwan). After the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China (CHN) and Chinese Taipei (TPE) have participated as separate teams.\n* **ZZX** Special code used by the IOC to refer to medals won by athletes of multiple nations competing together, which was common in early Games (1896–1904). These medals are not included in the respective totals for each nation represented by individual mixed team athletes.\n* **IOP** , **IOA** , **OAR** , **ROC** Special codes used by the IOC for athletes whose NOC is not recognized by IOC. At the 1992 Summer Olympics fifty eight athletes from former Yugoslavia competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP). At the 2000 Summer Olympics four athletes from East Timor competed as *Individual Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2012 Summer Olympics three athletes from former Netherlands Antilles and one athlete from South Sudan competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2014 Winter Olympics three athletes from India competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP). At the 2016 Summer Olympics nine athletes from Kuwait competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2018 Winter Olympics 168 athletes from Russia competed as *Olympics Athletes from Russia* (OAR). Since the 2020 Summer Olympics athletes from Russia are competing as *Russian Olympic Committee* (ROC).\n\n\n |\n\n### Name changes notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **BIZ** Belize participated under its former name of *British Honduras* (HBR) in 1968 and 1972.\n* **BEN** Benin was known as *Dahomey* (DAH) in 1972.\n* **BUR** Burkina Faso was known as *Upper Volta* (VOL) in 1972.\n* **TPE2** After the Chinese Civil War, Chinese Taipei (TPE) participated using the name of the *Republic of China* at the 1956, 1960, 1972 and 1976 (winter) Games and using *Taiwan* designation at the 1964 and 1968 Games. In 1979, the IOC started to use *Chinese Taipei* to refer to the NOC, a compromise that was acceptable for the People's Republic of China (CHN) that led to the start of its participation in the Olympic Games. The name Chinese Taipei was first used in 1984. Participation of the *Republic of China*, representing all of China (including Taiwan), in 1932, 1936 and 1948 Games are not counted in Taiwan's total participation count.\n* **COD** The Democratic Republic of the Congo was known as *Zaire* (ZAI) between 1984 and 1996.\n* **CIV** Côte d'Ivoire was known as *Ivory Coast* between 1964 and 1988.\n* **EGY** Egypt participated as the *United Arab Republic* (UAR) between 1960 and 1968.\n* **GBR** Includes medals won by athletes from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1896–1920) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1924–present), both of which used the name \"Great Britain\" and the country code GBR.\n | * **GHA** Prior to Ghana's independence in 1957, *Gold Coast* participated in the 1952 Games.\n* **GUY** Prior to Guyana's independence in 1966, *British Guiana* participated from 1948 to 1964.\n* **HKG** Totals of Hong Kong (HKG) includes all medals won by athletes representing the Hong Kong National Olympic Committee, designated as \"Hong Kong\" from 1952–1996 and \"Hong Kong, China\" since 2000.\n* **MKD** North Macedonia was known as *Macedonia*, or more formally *the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* due to a naming dispute with Greece, between 1996 and 2018.\n* **MYA** Myanmar was known as *Burma* (BIR) between 1948 and 1988.\n* **SAM** Samoa was known as *Western Samoa* between 1984 and 1996.\n* **SRI** Sri Lanka was known as *Ceylon* (CEY) between 1948 and 1972.\n* **SWZ** Eswatini was known as *Swaziland* between 1972 and 2016.\n* **TAN** Although Tanganyika and Zanzibar had already merged to form Tanzania in April 1964, the nation was designated *Tanganyika* in the official report of the 1964 Games.\n* **ZAM** Zambia achieved independence on the last day of the 1964 Games, but had participated as *Northern Rhodesia* (NRH) during those Games.\n* **ZIM** Prior to Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, *Southern Rhodesia* participated as *Rhodesia* (RHO) in 1928, 1960, and 1964 Games.\n\n\n |\n\n### Participation notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **A** Brunei's participation in the 1988 Games consisted only of a single official, but no competing athletes. This participation is not counted in Brunei's participation total.\n* **B** Djibouti at the 2004 Games took part in the Opening Ceremony, but neither athlete competed, so this participation is not counted in Djibouti's participation total.\n* **C** Liberia's athletes withdrew from 1980 Games after marching in the Opening Ceremony and took part in the boycott. This participation is not counted in Liberia's participation total.\n* **D** Libya marched in the opening ceremony of the 1964 Games, but then withdrew from competition. This participation is not counted in Libya's participation total.\n* **E** Suriname at the 1960 Games took part in the Opening Ceremony, but its lone athlete withdrew from Games due to a scheduling error. Participation of Suriname at the 1960 Games not recognized by IOC, so this participation is not counted in Suriname's participation total.\n | * **F** India's athletes originally competed at the 2014 Games as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic Flag during the opening ceremony due to the Indian Olympic Association's suspension. On February 11, 2014, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward.\n* **Ia** **Ib** Does not include the participation of East Timor's and Netherlands Antilles's athletes as *Individual Olympic Athletes* (IOA) at the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n* **Za** **Zb** **Zc** **Zd** **Ze** **Zf** **Zg** **Zh** **Zi** **Zj** **Zk** **Zl** **Zm** Does not include medals won as part of mixed teams with athletes from other nations (1896–1904).\n\n\n |\n\n### Disputed participation notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **H** The Bulgarian Olympic Committee claims that Charles Champaud, a Swiss gymnastics teacher living in Sofia, competed for the nation in 1896. Bulgarian participation at the 1896 Games is recognized by the IOC.\n* **I** The Chilean Olympic Committee claims that Luis Subercaseaux Errázuriz, a Chilean diplomat and athlete, competed for the nation in 1896. Chilean participation at the 1896 Games is recognized by the IOC.\n* **J** Some sources consider Léon Thiércelin, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Haitian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Haiti. Participation of Haiti at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Haiti's participation total.\n* **K** Some sources consider Freydoun Malkom, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Persian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Iran. Participation of Iran at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Iran's participation total.\n* **L** Some sources consider Carlos de Candamo, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Peruvian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Peru. Participation of Peru at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Peru's participation total.\n* **M** Enrico Brusoni's gold medal in the Cycling Men's Points Race at the 1900 Summer Olympics[36] is recognized by the Italian National Olympic Committee as well as the IOC[37] as being won in a 1900 Summer Olympics event, although some sources state it was unofficial.[38]\n* **N** Monaco earned a bronze in the art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics.[39] However, medals in art competitions are no longer recognized by the IOC.[40]\n* **Oa** **Ob** Michel Théato, a French athlete who won the gold medal in marathon at the 1900 Games, was born in Luxembourg.[4] The IOC does not recognize Luxembourg participation at the 1900 Games and attributes his medal to France.\n | The nationalities of many medalists at the 1904 Olympics are disputed as many competitors were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted US citizenship.\n* **Pa** **Pb** Sources are inconsistent regarding Albert Corey's participation in 1904, who immigrated to the United States from France. The Games report refers to Corey as a \"Frenchman wearing the colors of the Chicago Athletic Association\", but the IOC attributes his medal in the marathon to the United States, and in contradiction, the medal in the four mile team race (that was won by a team of three Americans and Corey) to a mixed team composed of athletes from multiple nations instead of just the United States.[41]\n* **Qa** **Qb** The International Olympic Committee considers Norwegian-American wrestlers Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen who immigrated from Norway to the United States to have competed for the United States. Each man won a gold medal.[42] In 2012, Norwegian historians however found documentation showing that Ericksen did not receive American citizenship until March 22, 1905, and that Hansen, who was registered as an \"alien\" (foreigner) as late as 1925, probably never received American citizenship. The historians have therefore petitioned the IOC to have the athletes registered as Norwegians.[43][44] In May 2013 it was reported that the Norwegian Olympic Committee had filed a formal application for changing the nationality of the wrestlers in the IOC's medal database.[45]\n* **R** Bob Fowler, an American marathon runner who competed at the 1904 Games, was a native Newfoundlander, Newfoundland is occasionally listed as a separate country at the 1904 Olympics, and would be listed as an historical NOC without medals.[46] Participation of Newfoundland at the 1904 Games is not recognized by the IOC.\n* **S** In 2009, historians from the International Society of Olympic Historians discovered that cyclist Frank Bizzoni was an Italian citizen when he competed in 1904 being granted US citizenship in 1917.[47][48] However, the IOC does not officially recognize Italy's participation in the 1904 Olympics.\n* **Fm** The IOC counts one gold, one silver, and two bronze medals won by American fencer Albertson Van Zo Post for Cuba instead of the United States. The one silver and one bronze medal won by American Charles Tatham are also counted for Cuba instead of the United States.\n\n\n |\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* All-time Paralympic Games medal table\n* All-time Youth Olympic Games medal table\n* Olympic medal table\n* List of first Olympic gold medalists by country\n* List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games\n* List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n* List of Olympic teams by medals won\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Olympic Games - Sochi 2014 | Winter Summer Past and Future Olympics\".

The United States has sent athletes to every Olympic Games with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics, during which it led a boycott in protest of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is the National Olympic Committee for the United States.\n\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,629 medals (1,061 of them gold) at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 330 (113 of them gold) at the Winter Olympic Games. This makes the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The United States remains one of the only major teams in the world to receive no government funding.[1][2][3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Swimmer Michael Phelps and President George W.

The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri were the first Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896 in Athens, the very first edition of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-World War-I period, primarily due to fielding considerably fewer athletes than host countries, with the exception being the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, where the U.S. achieved its largest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. During the interwar period, the U.S. enjoyed its greatest success, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in the 1936 Berlin games. The next summer Olympics were held in 1948 following World War II. In 1952, the Soviet Union made its Olympic debut, initiating a state-sponsored approach to international sport focused on projecting socio-political superiority. The rapid rise of the Soviet Union to challenge the United States as a leading Olympic power raised questions and suspicion about the means used to achieve this, including the pretense of professional athletes having amateur status and allegations of state-sponsored doping. After 20 years of competition on the Olympic stage, the USSR convincingly topped the medal chart at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. After that, the U.S. would not top the medal table in non-boycotted games until the 1996 Summer Olympics, five years after the USSR collapsed.[9][10] A bright spot for the United States was the 1984 games in Los Angeles, where the U.S. set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics (83), buoyed by the Soviet-led boycott. Coincident with a drive by the International Olympic Committee toward gender parity beginning in the 1990s, the U.S.’s fortunes improved, and the nation topped the medal table in the Summer Olympics six times since 1992 and placed second on two occasions.\n\n\nIn contrast to its summer Olympics status, the United States was not a power in the Winter Games until the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Hosting the games in 2002 boosted the U.S. winter sports program; since then, the country’s athletes have performed consistently well, never placing below fourth in the medal count. The nation won the most medals (37) at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver but dropped to 23 medals at the most recent 2018 games in Pyeongchang.\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

of America's first Olympic team in 1896. Standing: T.E. Burke, Thomas P. Curtis, Ellery H. Clark. Seated: W.W. Hoyt, Sumner Paine, trainer John Graham, John B. Paine, Arthur C. Blake.\n![](image)Margaret Abbott competing in golf. Abbott was the first American woman to win an Olympic event.\nThe first modern Olympic Games, held in Athens, Greece, saw the Americans fielding 14 athletes that competed in three sports. The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team managed to win only 20 medals, dwarfed by the enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to win 11 gold medals, edging out Greece, who secured 10 golds, and allowing Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. James Connolly became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the triple jump, and Thomas Burke won three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.[13]\n\n\nAt the 1900 Paris Olympics, the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts, who fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was Margaret Abbott, who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the women's golf. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of athletics, where US athletes clinched 16 golds and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of athletics, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly fewer athletes.[14]\n\n\nThe 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n\n\n### Interwar period (1920–1936)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics.\nJesse Owens achieved international fame at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany by winning four gold medals: in the 100 meters, long jump, 200 meters, and 4 × 100-meter relay, disproving the Nazi theory of Aryan racial superiority in the process.\n\n\n\n### Cold War era (1948–1992)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bob Mathias became the star of the 1948 London games by winning the decathlon event at the age of 17. He would go on to repeat this feat at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, setting a new world record.\nThe 1948 London Olympics marked the first time that newly communist countries, occupied by the Soviet Union after WW2, competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader Joseph Stalin demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up Sweden. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The US basketball team won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating France in the final, 65–21.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gold medal game in basketball at the 1952 Olympics between the US and the USSR. The Americans won, 36–25.\nIn 1952, Helsinki saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system's superiority.[16][17][9] The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were *de facto* professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.[18] The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the Soviets who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. US basketball team won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.[19][20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bobby Morrow won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne.\nMelbourne hosted the Olympics in 1956. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their invasion of Hungary, but the International Olympic Committee decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called Blood in the Water. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The US basketball team won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89–55.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wilma Rudolph became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the 1960 Rome Games.\nThe 1960 Rome Olympics saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the 100 meters freestyle, despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less than the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal-winning men's 4x100 relay team. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The US basketball team, however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Don Schollander won 4 golds in swimming at the 1964 games in Tokyo, the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since Jesse Owens in 1936.\nThere was some redemption for the US at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, as the nation returned to the top of the gold medal count for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their home-field advantage to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US–USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The US basketball team won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73–59.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)There were many historic achievements at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics but, perhaps, the most significant among them was Bob Beamon's performance in the long jump, where he improved the world record by 55 centimeters.\nThe 1968 Mexico Olympics became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the US basketball team won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Peggy Fleming an American former figure skater and the only American in the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France to bring home a gold medal.\nThe Munich Olympics saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972–1992, though in 1992 they would compete as the *Unified Team* as the USSR dissolved half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the Munich massacre in the second week, in which eleven Israeli athletes and coaches and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by Black September terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one of the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the 100 meters were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the 400 meters freestyle was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the 50 meters rifle only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the US basketball team was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and Greco-Roman (14–6 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German dopers.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 1976, Margaret Murdock captured the silver in the three positions shooting event. Lanny Bassham and Murdock tied for the first place, but Murdock was placed second after review of the targets. Bassham suggested that two gold medals be given, and after this request was declined, asked Murdock to share the top step with him at the award ceremony. Women had no separate shooting events at the time and were allowed to compete with men. Murdock became the first woman to win an Olympic medal in shooting.[26]\nThe Eastern Bloc dominated the 1976 Montreal Olympics, with seven countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history. This was an Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite the generally dismal showing of the overall delegation, swept 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and broke 11 world records in the process (arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),[27] while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to what was later shown to be a pervasive East German doping program.[28] They still managed to win a gold medal, in an upset of the East Germans in the 4x100 freestyle relay. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking being deprived of gold for the first time in US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when public revelation of the doping program began, their gold medal is considered to be one of the most improbable upsets of all time.[28] In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who secured a bulk of medals in the signature sports of the US, resulting in the USSR topping the medal table. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took five golds. The achievement was even more notable due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.[29] In other sports, US divers won five medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home four medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the mixed 50 meters rifle three positions; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with six medals overall. The US men's basketball team reclaimed the gold medal, while the women's team won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1–2 in the overall medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31 when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.[30]\n\n\nThe 1980 Summer Olympics marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant boycott in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's anti-Semitic policies.[31][32][33][34][35] The Soviet state-run media ridiculed the Americans as sore losers who couldn't get over the fact that they were no longer a perennial Olympic power, and simply didn't want to be embarrassed by the Soviets who would thrash them in the medal count. Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55–60 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40–45 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30–35 golds. However, the world would never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the host country and East Germany in what was the most skewed medal tally since 1904.[36] The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Ronald Reagan and Mary Lou Retton with the U.S. Olympic Team in Los Angeles, 1984. Retton had just recovered in time from surgery to compete for the all-around title, where she completed two perfect 10s to defeat her Soviet-bloc competitor by .05 points for the gold medal.\nIn 1984, Los Angeles witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles—Romania—encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60–65 gold medals compared to 35–45 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Among Olympic medalists, Shannon Miller is tied with Simone Biles as the most decorated U.S. gymnast, male or female, each with seven Olympic medals.\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul as well because South Korea had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognized and supported only North Korea. However, the policies of Perestroika that were initiated by Gorbachev in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. Cuba, clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate collapse but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals).\n\n\nDuring the Cold War period the Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules, and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.[35] Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, East Germany, with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own National Olympic Committee, and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e., boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n\n\n### Recent period (1994–present)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Her 2004 Olympics showing put her on an elite level, as she helped lead the USA softball team to a gold medal.\nU.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics in recent decades. The United States, represented by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2020, the Games were postponed to July 23 to August 8, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] The opening ceremony flag-bearers for the United States were baseball player Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird.[40] Javelin thrower Kara Winger was the flag-bearer for the closing ceremony.[41] When USA Gymnastics announced that 2016 Olympic all-around champion Biles would not participate in the gymnastics all-around final, the spotlight fell on her American team-mates. The U.S. had won the event in each of the last five Olympic Games: a formidable winning streak was on the line. Sunisa Lee embraced the moment and stood tall to deliver for her country. She totaled 57.433 to hold off Rebeca Andrade of Brazil (57.298) to clinch the title. Lee also made history of her own. With victory in the all-around she became the first Hmong American gymnast to win an Olympic gold medal. With a silver in the women's team final and bronze in the individual uneven bars Lee left Tokyo with an impressive three Olympic medals. Lydia Jacoby Alaska's swimming sweetheart made history when she was the first Alaskan swimmer selected to make the U.S. Olympic swim team. She stunned the world to secure victory in the women's 100m breaststroke. Recent major champion Nelly Korda followed the winning ways of compatriot Xander Schauffele to take home gold in the women's golf competition. The 2.01m-tall thrower Ryan Crouser retained his Olympic title in the men's shot put and did so in some style, setting an Olympic record three times.\n\n\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics, the USA exercised a diplomatic boycott, meaning it did not send any high-level delegation to the games, but would not hinder athletes from participating. The reasoning was the \"ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses.”[42] A total of 25 medals meant Team USA won two more medals than in 2018, although it still signifies an overall decline after 37 medals in 2010 and 28 in 2014. Notable successes included Jessie Diggins becoming the first American female skier to win individual cross-country medals, figure skater Nathan Chen breaking the short program world record on route to the Olympic gold medal in the men’s singles, Erin Jackson becoming the first black female athlete to win speed skating gold, and Chloe Kim defending her title in the snowboarding women’s halfpipe. Veteran snowboarder Lindsey Jacobellis, who last medaled in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, was the only U.S. athlete with multiple gold medals, winning the women's snowboard cross event, and sharing the gold with teammate Nick Baumgartner in the mixed snowboard cross event.\n\n\n\n## Amateurism and professionalism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)U.S. President George W. Bush visits Misty May-Treanor (left) and Kerri Walsh Jennings (right) at the 2008 Olympics.\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals, when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.[43]\n\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded the ideology of the pure amateur. It put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.[44][45][46] The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from amateurism, as envisioned by Pierre de Coubertin. They began allowing participation of professional athletes, but only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its influence within the International Olympic Committee.[47][48][49]\n\n\n\n## Prize money[edit]\n\n\nWhen a US athlete wins an Olympic medal, as of 2016, the USOPC paid the winner $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze.[50] The USOPC increased the payouts by 25% to $37,000 for gold, $22,500 for silver, and $15,000 for bronze beginning in 2017.[51] These numbers are significantly lower than in other countries, where Olympic gold medalists receive up to $1 million from their governments for a gold medal.[52][53] Since 2018, payouts to Paralympic athletes have been the same as to the Olympians. The International Paralympic Committee noted that \"'Operation Gold Awards' for [American] Paralympic athletes [would] be increased by as much as 400 percent.\"[54]\n\n\n\n## Doping[edit]\n\n\nUnited States has had eight Olympic medals stripped for doping violations. In all cases, the US government or the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) had nothing to do with it, and sanctioned athletes acted on their own. In the case of swimmer Rick DeMont, the USOC has recognized his gold medal performance in the 1972 Summer Olympics in 2001,[55] but only the IOC has the power to restore his medal, and it has as of 2017 refused to do so.[55] DeMont originally won the gold medal in 4:00.26. Following the race, the IOC stripped him of his gold medal[56] after his post-race urinalysis tested positive for traces of the banned substance ephedrine contained in his prescription asthma medication, Marax. The positive test following the 400-meter freestyle final also deprived him of a chance at multiple medals, as he was not permitted to swim in any other events at the 1972 Olympics, including the 1,500-meter freestyle for which he was the then-current world record-holder. Before the Olympics, DeMont had properly declared his asthma medications on his medical disclosure forms, but the USOC had not cleared them with the IOC's medical committee.[57][55]\n\n\nIn 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to *Sports Illustrated* that revealed that some 100 American athletes failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete; among those athletes were Carl Lewis, Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard.[58][59][60][61] Before showing the documents to *Sports Illustrated*, Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests. His case was summarily dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence. The USOC claimed his case \"baseless\" as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules.[62][63]\n\n\nCarl Lewis broke his silence on allegations that he was the beneficiary of a drugs cover-up, admitting he had failed tests for banned substances, but claiming he was just one of \"hundreds\" of American athletes who were allowed to escape bans, concealed by the USOC. Lewis has acknowledged that he failed three tests during the 1988 US Olympic trials, which under international rules at the time should have prevented him from competing in the 1988 Summer Olympics.[64] Former athletes and officials came out against the USOC cover-up. \"For so many years I lived it. I knew this was going on, but there's absolutely nothing you can do as an athlete. You have to believe governing bodies are doing what they are supposed to do. And it is obvious they did not,\" said former American sprinter and 1984 Olympic champion, Evelyn Ashford.[65]\n\n\nExum's documents revealed that Carl Lewis had tested positive three times at the 1988 Olympics trials for minimum amounts of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, which were banned stimulants. Bronchodilators are also found in cold medication. Due to the rules, his case could have led to disqualification from the Seoul Olympics and suspension from competition for six months. The levels of the combined stimulants registered in the separate tests were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm.[62] Lewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain \"Ma Huang\", the Chinese name for Ephedra (ephedrine is known to help weight loss).[62] Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.[66][67] The highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances.[62][68] According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed that \"These [levels] are what you'd see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.\"[62] Following Exum's revelations the IAAF acknowledged that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. Additionally, in 1988 the federation reviewed the relevant documents with the athletes' names undisclosed and stated that \"the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the USOC as 'negative cases' in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken\".[69][70]\n\n\n\n### Disqualified medalists[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of stripped Olympic medals\n\nThe United States has had eight Olympic medals stripped, which is fifth in the ranking of countries with the most stripped medals.[71]\n\n\n\n* 1972 Summer Olympics, Rick DeMont, first place, gold medalist, Swimming, Men's 400 m freestyle[72]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Marion Jones, first place, gold medalist, Athletics, Women's 100 m[73]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Marion Jones, first place, gold medalist, Athletics, Women's 200 m[73]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Marion Jones, third place, bronze medalist, Athletics, Women's long jump[73]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Relay team (Antonio Pettigrew, Jerome Young), first place, gold medalists, Athletics, Men's 4 × 400 m relay[74]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Lance Armstrong, third place, bronze medalist, Cycling, Men's road time trial[75]\n* 2004 Summer Olympics, Tyler Hamilton, first place, gold medalist, Cycling, Men's road time trial[76]\n* 2012 Summer Olympics, Relay team (Tyson Gay), second place, silver medalist, Athletics, Men's 4 × 100 m relay[77]\n\n\n## Russia–United States rivalry[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section's **tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia**.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, the Americans hadn't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the 1952 tournament, the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, 1956, 1960, and 1964, and bronze in 1968. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the World Championship play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament.\n\n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers, which allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.[84] On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics, as they were officially professional and played in the NBA. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning, as they won the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the basketball court was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly anti-American.[85] There were rumors that the Communist party had bribed the officials, because they wanted the USSR to win 50 gold medals at these Olympics, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union.[86]\n\n\nThe United States team was the youngest in history. American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star Bill Walton declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored, featuring such players as Doug Collins or Tommy Burleson (the tallest player among all teams).\n\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars Sergei Belov, Modestas Paulauskas, and Alexander Belov. The players had played together for more than seven years. For Gennadi Volnov it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4–8 points behind during the first half.\n\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted Dwight Jones, as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by Mikheil Korkia and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit Jim Brewer during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, Doug Collins stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by Zurab Sakandelidze as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee Renato Righetto to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds, and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, the final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' Alexander Belov and the USA's Kevin Joyce and Jim Forbes went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\n\n\n#### Later Olympics[edit]\n\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in 1976, but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In 1988, the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. The 1988 game was a turning point in international basketball. FIBA officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair, and in 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.[87][88][89]\n\n\n\n### Ice hockey[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Miracle on Ice\n\n![](image)An amateur photo featuring 1980 U.S. vs USSR ice hockey matchup\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"Miracle on Ice\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union, on the way to a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the 1960 Games at Squaw Valley, California, defeating the Soviet Union, Canada, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".[90][91]\n\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in 1988. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7–5 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\n\n\n![](image)Hilary Knight is one of the top stars in U.S. women's ice hockey. Knight helped lead Team USA to gold at the 2018 PyeongChang Games—their first Olympic victory in 20 years.\nThe two teams met again at the 1992 Olympics in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5–2. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey. The Americans won both games 5–2 enroute to the tournament championship.\n\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by Slava Fetisov, met twice in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, which included a 2–2 round-robin draw and a 3–2 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game. The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, with the U.S. earning a decisive 5–3 victory.\n\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The game was tied 2–2 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with T.J. Oshie scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length.[92] Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of United States Olympic medalists\n* United States at the Paralympics\n* United States at the Summer Olympics\n* United States at the Winter Olympics\n* United States at the Pan American Games\n* Four territories of the United States send independent Olympic teams (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** [1] [*bare URL*]\n2. **^** Skousen, Mark (August 17, 2016). \"Privately Funded USA Olympic Team...Wins!\". *Townhall*.\n3. **^** Crookston, Paul (August 10, 2016). \"U.S. Has Done Fine with No Government Department of Sports\". *National Review*.\n4. **^** Hart, Torrey (August 7, 2020). \"U.S. Olympic Athletes in Financial Limbo Without Olympics, Events\".\n5. **^** Bachman, Rachel (April 12, 2020). \"WSJ News Exclusive | U.S. Olympic Sports Groups Seek Government Aid\". *Wall Street Journal* – via www.wsj.com.\n6. **^** Carter Vaughn Findley; John Alexander Rothney (January 1, 2011). *Twentieth-Century World*.

The United States has sent athletes to every Olympic Games with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics, during which it led a boycott in protest of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is the National Olympic Committee for the United States.\n\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,629 medals (1,061 of them gold) at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 330 (113 of them gold) at the Winter Olympic Games. This makes the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The United States remains one of the only major teams in the world to receive no government funding.[1][2][3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Swimmer Michael Phelps and President George W.

The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri were the first Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896 in Athens, the very first edition of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-World War-I period, primarily due to fielding considerably fewer athletes than host countries, with the exception being the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, where the U.S. achieved its largest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. During the interwar period, the U.S. enjoyed its greatest success, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in the 1936 Berlin games. The next summer Olympics were held in 1948 following World War II. In 1952, the Soviet Union made its Olympic debut, initiating a state-sponsored approach to international sport focused on projecting socio-political superiority. The rapid rise of the Soviet Union to challenge the United States as a leading Olympic power raised questions and suspicion about the means used to achieve this, including the pretense of professional athletes having amateur status and allegations of state-sponsored doping. After 20 years of competition on the Olympic stage, the USSR convincingly topped the medal chart at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. After that, the U.S. would not top the medal table in non-boycotted games until the 1996 Summer Olympics, five years after the USSR collapsed.[9][10] A bright spot for the United States was the 1984 games in Los Angeles, where the U.S. set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics (83), buoyed by the Soviet-led boycott. Coincident with a drive by the International Olympic Committee toward gender parity beginning in the 1990s, the U.S.’s fortunes improved, and the nation topped the medal table in the Summer Olympics six times since 1992 and placed second on two occasions.\n\n\nIn contrast to its summer Olympics status, the United States was not a power in the Winter Games until the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Hosting the games in 2002 boosted the U.S. winter sports program; since then, the country’s athletes have performed consistently well, never placing below fourth in the medal count. The nation won the most medals (37) at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver but dropped to 23 medals at the most recent 2018 games in Pyeongchang.\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

of America's first Olympic team in 1896. Standing: T.E. Burke, Thomas P. Curtis, Ellery H. Clark. Seated: W.W. Hoyt, Sumner Paine, trainer John Graham, John B. Paine, Arthur C. Blake.\n![](image)Margaret Abbott competing in golf. Abbott was the first American woman to win an Olympic event.\nThe first modern Olympic Games, held in Athens, Greece, saw the Americans fielding 14 athletes that competed in three sports. The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team managed to win only 20 medals, dwarfed by the enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to win 11 gold medals, edging out Greece, who secured 10 golds, and allowing Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. James Connolly became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the triple jump, and Thomas Burke won three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.[13]\n\n\nAt the 1900 Paris Olympics, the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts, who fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was Margaret Abbott, who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the women's golf. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of athletics, where US athletes clinched 16 golds and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of athletics, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly fewer athletes.[14]\n\n\nThe 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n\n\n### Interwar period (1920–1936)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics.\nJesse Owens achieved international fame at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany by winning four gold medals: in the 100 meters, long jump, 200 meters, and 4 × 100-meter relay, disproving the Nazi theory of Aryan racial superiority in the process.\n\n\n\n### Cold War era (1948–1992)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bob Mathias became the star of the 1948 London games by winning the decathlon event at the age of 17. He would go on to repeat this feat at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, setting a new world record.\nThe 1948 London Olympics marked the first time that newly communist countries, occupied by the Soviet Union after WW2, competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader Joseph Stalin demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up Sweden. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The US basketball team won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating France in the final, 65–21.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gold medal game in basketball at the 1952 Olympics between the US and the USSR. The Americans won, 36–25.\nIn 1952, Helsinki saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system's superiority.[16][17][9] The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were *de facto* professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.[18] The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the Soviets who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. US basketball team won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.[19][20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bobby Morrow won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne.\nMelbourne hosted the Olympics in 1956. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their invasion of Hungary, but the International Olympic Committee decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called Blood in the Water. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The US basketball team won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89–55.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wilma Rudolph became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the 1960 Rome Games.\nThe 1960 Rome Olympics saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the 100 meters freestyle, despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less than the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal-winning men's 4x100 relay team. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The US basketball team, however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Don Schollander won 4 golds in swimming at the 1964 games in Tokyo, the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since Jesse Owens in 1936.\nThere was some redemption for the US at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, as the nation returned to the top of the gold medal count for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their home-field advantage to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US–USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The US basketball team won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73–59.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)There were many historic achievements at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics but, perhaps, the most significant among them was Bob Beamon's performance in the long jump, where he improved the world record by 55 centimeters.\nThe 1968 Mexico Olympics became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the US basketball team won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Peggy Fleming an American former figure skater and the only American in the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France to bring home a gold medal.\nThe Munich Olympics saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972–1992, though in 1992 they would compete as the *Unified Team* as the USSR dissolved half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the Munich massacre in the second week, in which eleven Israeli athletes and coaches and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by Black September terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one of the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the 100 meters were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the 400 meters freestyle was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the 50 meters rifle only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the US basketball team was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and Greco-Roman (14–6 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German dopers.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 1976, Margaret Murdock captured the silver in the three positions shooting event. Lanny Bassham and Murdock tied for the first place, but Murdock was placed second after review of the targets. Bassham suggested that two gold medals be given, and after this request was declined, asked Murdock to share the top step with him at the award ceremony. Women had no separate shooting events at the time and were allowed to compete with men. Murdock became the first woman to win an Olympic medal in shooting.[26]\nThe Eastern Bloc dominated the 1976 Montreal Olympics, with seven countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history. This was an Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite the generally dismal showing of the overall delegation, swept 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and broke 11 world records in the process (arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),[27] while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to what was later shown to be a pervasive East German doping program.[28] They still managed to win a gold medal, in an upset of the East Germans in the 4x100 freestyle relay. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking being deprived of gold for the first time in US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when public revelation of the doping program began, their gold medal is considered to be one of the most improbable upsets of all time.[28] In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who secured a bulk of medals in the signature sports of the US, resulting in the USSR topping the medal table. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took five golds. The achievement was even more notable due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.[29] In other sports, US divers won five medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home four medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the mixed 50 meters rifle three positions; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with six medals overall. The US men's basketball team reclaimed the gold medal, while the women's team won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1–2 in the overall medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31 when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.[30]\n\n\nThe 1980 Summer Olympics marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant boycott in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's anti-Semitic policies.[31][32][33][34][35] The Soviet state-run media ridiculed the Americans as sore losers who couldn't get over the fact that they were no longer a perennial Olympic power, and simply didn't want to be embarrassed by the Soviets who would thrash them in the medal count. Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55–60 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40–45 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30–35 golds. However, the world would never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the host country and East Germany in what was the most skewed medal tally since 1904.[36] The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Ronald Reagan and Mary Lou Retton with the U.S. Olympic Team in Los Angeles, 1984. Retton had just recovered in time from surgery to compete for the all-around title, where she completed two perfect 10s to defeat her Soviet-bloc competitor by .05 points for the gold medal.\nIn 1984, Los Angeles witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles—Romania—encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60–65 gold medals compared to 35–45 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Among Olympic medalists, Shannon Miller is tied with Simone Biles as the most decorated U.S. gymnast, male or female, each with seven Olympic medals.\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul as well because South Korea had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognized and supported only North Korea. However, the policies of Perestroika that were initiated by Gorbachev in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. Cuba, clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate collapse but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals).\n\n\nDuring the Cold War period the Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules, and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.[35] Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, East Germany, with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own National Olympic Committee, and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e., boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n\n\n### Recent period (1994–present)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(February 2020)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)Jennie Finch signing autographs. From 1998 to 2010, Finch became the most recognizable face on a dominant squad. Her 2004 Olympics showing put her on an elite level, as she helped lead the USA softball team to a gold medal.\nU.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics in recent decades. The United States, represented by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2020, the Games were postponed to July 23 to August 8, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] The opening ceremony flag-bearers for the United States were baseball player Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird.[40] Javelin thrower Kara Winger was the flag-bearer for the closing ceremony.[41] When USA Gymnastics announced that 2016 Olympic all-around champion Biles would not participate in the gymnastics all-around final, the spotlight fell on her American team-mates. The U.S. had won the event in each of the last five Olympic Games: a formidable winning streak was on the line. Sunisa Lee embraced the moment and stood tall to deliver for her country. She totaled 57.433 to hold off Rebeca Andrade of Brazil (57.298) to clinch the title. Lee also made history of her own. With victory in the all-around she became the first Hmong American gymnast to win an Olympic gold medal. With a silver in the women's team final and bronze in the individual uneven bars Lee left Tokyo with an impressive three Olympic medals. Lydia Jacoby Alaska's swimming sweetheart made history when she was the first Alaskan swimmer selected to make the U.S. Olympic swim team. She stunned the world to secure victory in the women's 100m breaststroke. Recent major champion Nelly Korda followed the winning ways of compatriot Xander Schauffele to take home gold in the women's golf competition. The 2.01m-tall thrower Ryan Crouser retained his Olympic title in the men's shot put and did so in some style, setting an Olympic record three times.\n\n\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics, the USA exercised a diplomatic boycott, meaning it did not send any high-level delegation to the games, but would not hinder athletes from participating. The reasoning was the \"ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses.”[42] A total of 25 medals meant Team USA won two more medals than in 2018, although it still signifies an overall decline after 37 medals in 2010 and 28 in 2014. Notable successes included Jessie Diggins becoming the first American female skier to win individual cross-country medals, figure skater Nathan Chen breaking the short program world record on route to the Olympic gold medal in the men’s singles, Erin Jackson becoming the first black female athlete to win speed skating gold, and Chloe Kim defending her title in the snowboarding women’s halfpipe. Veteran snowboarder Lindsey Jacobellis, who last medaled in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, was the only U.S. athlete with multiple gold medals, winning the women's snowboard cross event, and sharing the gold with teammate Nick Baumgartner in the mixed snowboard cross event.\n\n\n\n## Amateurism and professionalism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)U.S. President George W. Bush visits Misty May-Treanor (left) and Kerri Walsh Jennings (right) at the 2008 Olympics.\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals, when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.[43]\n\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded the ideology of the pure amateur. It put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.[44][45][46] The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from amateurism, as envisioned by Pierre de Coubertin. They began allowing participation of professional athletes, but only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its influence within the International Olympic Committee.[47][48][49]\n\n\n\n## Prize money[edit]\n\n\nWhen a US athlete wins an Olympic medal, as of 2016, the USOPC paid the winner $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze.[50] The USOPC increased the payouts by 25% to $37,000 for gold, $22,500 for silver, and $15,000 for bronze beginning in 2017.[51] These numbers are significantly lower than in other countries, where Olympic gold medalists receive up to $1 million from their governments for a gold medal.[52][53] Since 2018, payouts to Paralympic athletes have been the same as to the Olympians. The International Paralympic Committee noted that \"'Operation Gold Awards' for [American] Paralympic athletes [would] be increased by as much as 400 percent.\"[54]\n\n\n\n## Doping[edit]\n\n\nUnited States has had eight Olympic medals stripped for doping violations. In all cases, the US government or the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) had nothing to do with it, and sanctioned athletes acted on their own. In the case of swimmer Rick DeMont, the USOC has recognized his gold medal performance in the 1972 Summer Olympics in 2001,[55] but only the IOC has the power to restore his medal, and it has as of 2017 refused to do so.[55] DeMont originally won the gold medal in 4:00.26. Following the race, the IOC stripped him of his gold medal[56] after his post-race urinalysis tested positive for traces of the banned substance ephedrine contained in his prescription asthma medication, Marax. The positive test following the 400-meter freestyle final also deprived him of a chance at multiple medals, as he was not permitted to swim in any other events at the 1972 Olympics, including the 1,500-meter freestyle for which he was the then-current world record-holder. Before the Olympics, DeMont had properly declared his asthma medications on his medical disclosure forms, but the USOC had not cleared them with the IOC's medical committee.[57][55]\n\n\nIn 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to *Sports Illustrated* that revealed that some 100 American athletes failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete; among those athletes were Carl Lewis, Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard.[58][59][60][61] Before showing the documents to *Sports Illustrated*, Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests. His case was summarily dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence. The USOC claimed his case \"baseless\" as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules.[62][63]\n\n\nCarl Lewis broke his silence on allegations that he was the beneficiary of a drugs cover-up, admitting he had failed tests for banned substances, but claiming he was just one of \"hundreds\" of American athletes who were allowed to escape bans, concealed by the USOC. Lewis has acknowledged that he failed three tests during the 1988 US Olympic trials, which under international rules at the time should have prevented him from competing in the 1988 Summer Olympics.[64] Former athletes and officials came out against the USOC cover-up. \"For so many years I lived it. I knew this was going on, but there's absolutely nothing you can do as an athlete. You have to believe governing bodies are doing what they are supposed to do. And it is obvious they did not,\" said former American sprinter and 1984 Olympic champion, Evelyn Ashford.[65]\n\n\nExum's documents revealed that Carl Lewis had tested positive three times at the 1988 Olympics trials for minimum amounts of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, which were banned stimulants. Bronchodilators are also found in cold medication. Due to the rules, his case could have led to disqualification from the Seoul Olympics and suspension from competition for six months. The levels of the combined stimulants registered in the separate tests were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm.[62] Lewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain \"Ma Huang\", the Chinese name for Ephedra (ephedrine is known to help weight loss).[62] Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.[66][67] The highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances.[62][68] According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed that \"These [levels] are what you'd see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.\"[62] Following Exum's revelations the IAAF acknowledged that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. Additionally, in 1988 the federation reviewed the relevant documents with the athletes' names undisclosed and stated that \"the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the USOC as 'negative cases' in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken\".[69][70]\n\n\n\n### Disqualified medalists[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of stripped Olympic medals\n\nThe United States has had eight Olympic medals stripped, which is fifth in the ranking of countries with the most stripped medals.[71]\n\n\n\n* 1972 Summer Olympics, Rick DeMont, first place, gold medalist, Swimming, Men's 400 m freestyle[72]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Marion Jones, first place, gold medalist, Athletics, Women's 100 m[73]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Marion Jones, first place, gold medalist, Athletics, Women's 200 m[73]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Marion Jones, third place, bronze medalist, Athletics, Women's long jump[73]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Relay team (Antonio Pettigrew, Jerome Young), first place, gold medalists, Athletics, Men's 4 × 400 m relay[74]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Lance Armstrong, third place, bronze medalist, Cycling, Men's road time trial[75]\n* 2004 Summer Olympics, Tyler Hamilton, first place, gold medalist, Cycling, Men's road time trial[76]\n* 2012 Summer Olympics, Relay team (Tyson Gay), second place, silver medalist, Athletics, Men's 4 × 100 m relay[77]\n\n\n## Russia–United States rivalry[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section's **tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia**.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, the Americans hadn't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the 1952 tournament, the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, 1956, 1960, and 1964, and bronze in 1968. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the World Championship play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament.\n\n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers, which allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.[84] On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics, as they were officially professional and played in the NBA. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning, as they won the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the basketball court was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly anti-American.[85] There were rumors that the Communist party had bribed the officials, because they wanted the USSR to win 50 gold medals at these Olympics, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union.[86]\n\n\nThe United States team was the youngest in history. American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star Bill Walton declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored, featuring such players as Doug Collins or Tommy Burleson (the tallest player among all teams).\n\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars Sergei Belov, Modestas Paulauskas, and Alexander Belov. The players had played together for more than seven years. For Gennadi Volnov it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4–8 points behind during the first half.\n\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted Dwight Jones, as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by Mikheil Korkia and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit Jim Brewer during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, Doug Collins stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by Zurab Sakandelidze as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee Renato Righetto to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds, and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, the final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' Alexander Belov and the USA's Kevin Joyce and Jim Forbes went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\n\n\n#### Later Olympics[edit]\n\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in 1976, but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In 1988, the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. The 1988 game was a turning point in international basketball. FIBA officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair, and in 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.[87][88][89]\n\n\n\n### Ice hockey[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Miracle on Ice\n\n![](image)An amateur photo featuring 1980 U.S. vs USSR ice hockey matchup\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"Miracle on Ice\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union, on the way to a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the 1960 Games at Squaw Valley, California, defeating the Soviet Union, Canada, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".[90][91]\n\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in 1988. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7–5 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\n\n\n![](image)Hilary Knight is one of the top stars in U.S. women's ice hockey. Knight helped lead Team USA to gold at the 2018 PyeongChang Games—their first Olympic victory in 20 years.\nThe two teams met again at the 1992 Olympics in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5–2. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey. The Americans won both games 5–2 enroute to the tournament championship.\n\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by Slava Fetisov, met twice in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, which included a 2–2 round-robin draw and a 3–2 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game. The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, with the U.S. earning a decisive 5–3 victory.\n\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The game was tied 2–2 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with T.J. Oshie scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length.[92] Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of United States Olympic medalists\n* United States at the Paralympics\n* United States at the Summer Olympics\n* United States at the Winter Olympics\n* United States at the Pan American Games\n* Four territories of the United States send independent Olympic teams (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** [1] [*bare URL*]\n2. **^** Skousen, Mark (August 17, 2016). \"Privately Funded USA Olympic Team...Wins!\". *Townhall*.\n3. **^** Crookston, Paul (August 10, 2016). \"U.S. Has Done Fine with No Government Department of Sports\". *National Review*.\n4. **^** Hart, Torrey (August 7, 2020). \"U.S. Olympic Athletes in Financial Limbo Without Olympics, Events\".\n5. **^** Bachman, Rachel (April 12, 2020). \"WSJ News Exclusive | U.S. Olympic Sports Groups Seek Government Aid\". *Wall Street Journal* – via www.wsj.com.\n6. **^** Carter Vaughn Findley; John Alexander Rothney (January 1, 2011). *Twentieth-Century World*.

At six of its nine appearances at the Summer Olympic Games, the Soviet team ranked first in the total number of gold medals won, second three times, and became the biggest contender to the United States' domination in the Summer Games. Similarly, the team was ranked first in the gold medal count seven times and second twice in its nine appearances at the Winter Olympic Games. The Soviet Union's success might be attributed to a heavy state investment in sports to fulfill its political objectives on an international stage.[1]\n\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of November 1917 and the Russian Civil War (1917–1922), the Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events on ideological grounds;[2] however, after World War II (1939–1945), dominating the Olympic Games came to be seen by Soviet officials and leaders as a useful method of promoting communism.[3] *The Olympic Committee of the USSR* was formed on April 21, 1951, and the IOC recognised the new body in its 45th session (May 7, 1951). In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement.\n\n\nThe 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. On July 20, 1952 Nina Romashkova won the first Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport, competing in the women's discus throw. Romashkova's result in this event (51.42 m) was the new Olympic record at that time.\n\n\nThe 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo became the first Winter Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. There Lyubov Kozyreva won the first Winter Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport, competing in the women's cross-country skiing 10 km event.\n\n\nThe USSR became the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The United States and many other countries boycotted these Games in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; the USSR led a boycott of the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\nAlthough the USSR ceased to exist on December 26, 1991, *The Olympic Committee of the USSR* formally existed until March 12, 1992, when it disbanded.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1992, 7 of the 15 former Soviet Republics competed together as the Unified Team and marched under the Olympic Flag in the Albertville Games, where they finished second in the medal rankings. The Unified Team also competed in the Barcelona Games later in the year (represented by 12 of the 15 ex-Republics), and finished first in the medal rankings at those Games.\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted

All Soviet athletes held some nominal jobs, but were in fact state-sponsored and trained full-time. According to many experts, that gave the Soviet Union a huge advantage over the United States and other Western countries, whose athletes were students or real amateurs.[4][5] Indeed, the Soviet Union monopolized the top place in the medal standings after 1968, and, until its collapse, placed second only once, in the 1984 Winter games, after another Eastern bloc nation, the GDR. Amateur rules were relaxed only in the late 1980s and were almost completely abolished in the 1990s, after the fall of the USSR.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Doping[edit]\n\n\nAccording to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".[8][9] On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games.\"[8]\n\n\nDocuments obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements.[10] The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.[10]\n\n\n\n### Flag bearers controversy[edit]\n\n\nSoviet officials expected the flag bearer to show an example of an attractive, physically strong person and a distinguished athlete. He was expected to carry the flag through the Olympic ceremony in one hand unsupported by a harness. This presented a formidable physical task as the flag weighed 16 kilograms (35 lb) in the 1960s, and a sudden wind might further increase the physical load. Hence the Soviet flag bearers at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics were selected from among heavyweight weightlifters or wrestlers, who did not have to compete the next day.[11]\n\n\nSoviet officials also expected the flag bearer to win a gold medal at the given Olympics. This resulted in absurd situations at the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics, when the selected flag bearers, Yakov Kutsenko and Aleksey Medvedev respectively, were not allowed to compete because the officials did not believe they would win a gold medal. Both were top-level heavyweight weightlifters. Kutsenko placed second at the 1950 World Championships and Medvedev won the world title in 1956 and 1957.[11]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of flag bearers for the Soviet Union at the Olympics\n* Category:Olympic competitors for the Soviet Union\n* Soviet Union at the Paralympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Role of Sports in the Soviet Union | Guided History\".\n2. **^** Keys, Barbara J.

At six of its nine appearances at the Summer Olympic Games, the Soviet team ranked first in the total number of gold medals won, second three times, and became the biggest contender to the United States' domination in the Summer Games. Similarly, the team was ranked first in the gold medal count seven times and second twice in its nine appearances at the Winter Olympic Games. The Soviet Union's success might be attributed to a heavy state investment in sports to fulfill its political objectives on an international stage.[1]\n\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of November 1917 and the Russian Civil War (1917–1922), the Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events on ideological grounds;[2] however, after World War II (1939–1945), dominating the Olympic Games came to be seen by Soviet officials and leaders as a useful method of promoting communism.[3] *The Olympic Committee of the USSR* was formed on April 21, 1951, and the IOC recognised the new body in its 45th session (May 7, 1951). In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement.\n\n\nThe 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. On July 20, 1952 Nina Romashkova won the first Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport, competing in the women's discus throw. Romashkova's result in this event (51.42 m) was the new Olympic record at that time.\n\n\nThe 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo became the first Winter Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. There Lyubov Kozyreva won the first Winter Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport, competing in the women's cross-country skiing 10 km event.\n\n\nThe USSR became the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The United States and many other countries boycotted these Games in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; the USSR led a boycott of the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\nAlthough the USSR ceased to exist on December 26, 1991, *The Olympic Committee of the USSR* formally existed until March 12, 1992, when it disbanded.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1992, 7 of the 15 former Soviet Republics competed together as the Unified Team and marched under the Olympic Flag in the Albertville Games, where they finished second in the medal rankings. The Unified Team also competed in the Barcelona Games later in the year (represented by 12 of the 15 ex-Republics), and finished first in the medal rankings at those Games.\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted

All Soviet athletes held some nominal jobs, but were in fact state-sponsored and trained full-time. According to many experts, that gave the Soviet Union a huge advantage over the United States and other Western countries, whose athletes were students or real amateurs.[4][5] Indeed, the Soviet Union monopolized the top place in the medal standings after 1968, and, until its collapse, placed second only once, in the 1984 Winter games, after another Eastern bloc nation, the GDR. Amateur rules were relaxed only in the late 1980s and were almost completely abolished in the 1990s, after the fall of the USSR.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Doping[edit]\n\n\nAccording to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".[8][9] On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games.\"[8]\n\n\nDocuments obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements.[10] The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.[10]\n\n\n\n### Flag bearers controversy[edit]\n\n\nSoviet officials expected the flag bearer to show an example of an attractive, physically strong person and a distinguished athlete. He was expected to carry the flag through the Olympic ceremony in one hand unsupported by a harness. This presented a formidable physical task as the flag weighed 16 kilograms (35 lb) in the 1960s, and a sudden wind might further increase the physical load. Hence the Soviet flag bearers at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics were selected from among heavyweight weightlifters or wrestlers, who did not have to compete the next day.[11]\n\n\nSoviet officials also expected the flag bearer to win a gold medal at the given Olympics. This resulted in absurd situations at the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics, when the selected flag bearers, Yakov Kutsenko and Aleksey Medvedev respectively, were not allowed to compete because the officials did not believe they would win a gold medal. Both were top-level heavyweight weightlifters. Kutsenko placed second at the 1950 World Championships and Medvedev won the world title in 1956 and 1957.[11]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of flag bearers for the Soviet Union at the Olympics\n* Category:Olympic competitors for the Soviet Union\n* Soviet Union at the Paralympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Role of Sports in the Soviet Union | Guided History\".\n2. **^** Keys, Barbara J.

Tennis in 1896 was a sport that allowed mixed teams, and both Boland and George S. Robertson joined partners from other nations to win their medals. Great Britain again dominated in 1900, taking all four gold medals and adding seven others (three as part of mixed teams).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to official data of the International Olympic Committee.

In July 2021, the 2032 Games were awarded to Brisbane.\n\n\n\n## Medals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Silver | Kriss AkabusiGarry CookTodd Bennett Phil Brown | ![United States](image) 1984 Los Angeles | ![](image) Athletics | Men's 4 x 400 metres relay\n |\n| ![](image) Bronze | Charlie Spedding | ![United States](image) 1984 Los Angeles | ![](image) Athletics | Men's marathon\n |\n| ![](image) Bronze | Keith Connor | ![United States](image) 1984 Los Angeles | ![](image) Athletics | Men's triple jump\n |\n| ![](image) Silver | David Ottley | ![United States](image) 1984 Los Angeles | ![](image) Athletics | Men's javelin throw\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Daley Thompson | ![United States](image) 1984 Los Angeles | ![](image) Athletics | Men's decathlon\n |\n| ![](image) Bronze | Kathy Smallwood-Cook | ![United States](image) 1984 Los Angeles | ![](image) Athletics | Women's 400 metres\n |\n| ![](image) Silver | Wendy Smith-Sly | ![United States](image) 1984 Los Angeles | ![](image) Athletics | Women's 3000 metres\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the Winter Olympics as a non-alpine team Great Britain has historically been unable to replicate the amount of success they have achieved in the Summer Olympics although the team enjoyed gold medal success at figure skating through the seventies and eighties, while in recent years, the expansion of the Winter Olympics to include sports such as Curling, Snowboarding, Skeleton and Freestyle skiing has brought some renewed success. Currently, Great Britain is the most successful team in women's skeleton, having won a medal six times, and every gold medal from 2010 to 2018. The most successful Winter Olympian from the Great Britain team is Lizzy Yarnold, with two gold medals, both in the women's skeleton.\n\n\n\n\n## Eligibility[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Gold | Richard BudgettMartin CrossAdrian EllisonAndy HolmesSteve Redgrave | ![United States](image) 1984 Los Angeles | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxed four\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Andy HolmesSteve Redgrave | ![South Korea](image) 1988 Seoul | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless pair\n |\n| ![](image) Bronze | Andy HolmesSteve RedgravePatrick Sweeney | ![South Korea](image) 1988 Seoul | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxed pair\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Matthew PinsentSteve Redgrave | ![Spain](image) 1992 Barcelona | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless pair\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Garry HerbertGreg SearleJonny Searle | ![Spain](image) 1992 Barcelona | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxed pair\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Matthew PinsentSteve Redgrave | ![United States](image) 1996 Atlanta | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless pair\n |\n| ![](image) Bronze | Gregory SearleJonathan William SearleRupert John ObholzerTim Foster | ![United States](image) 1996 Atlanta | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless four\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Gold | John BadcockHugh EdwardsJack BeresfordRowland George | ![United States](image) 1932 Los Angeles | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless four\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Jack BeresfordDick Southwood | ![Germany](image) 1936 Berlin | ![](image) Rowing | Men's double sculls\n |\n| ![](image) Silver | Martin BristowAlan BarrettPeter JacksonJohn Sturrock | ![Germany](image) 1936 Berlin | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless four\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Richard BurnellBertie Bushnell | ![United Kingdom](image) 1948 London | ![](image) Rowing | Men's double sculls\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | John WilsonRan Laurie | ![United Kingdom](image) 1948 London | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless pair\n |\n| ![](image) Silver | Christopher BartonMichael LapageGuy RichardsonPaul BircherPaul MasseyBrian LloydJohn MeyrickAlfred MellowsJack Dearlove | ![United Kingdom](image) 1948 London | ![](image) Rowing | Men's eight\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGreat Britain first competed in gymnastics in the inaugural 1896 Olympics, with wrestler Launceston Elliot entering the rope climbing event and finishing last. Great Britain's first gymnastics medal came in 1908 with a silver in the men's individual all-around. Until 2008, Great Britain's last medal for gymnastics was a Bronze in the Women's all-round team event in 1928. At the 2012 Summer Games in London, Great Britain equaled its tally for all previous games combined, winning 4 medals to bring their all-time total to eight. A record seven medals, including first ever gold medals, were won in 2016, while a further three, including one gold, were won at the 2020 Games. Having won only four medals in total between 1896 and 2008, 14 medals, including 3 gold medals were secured between 2012 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Gold | Jess LearmonthJonathan BrownleeGeorgia Taylor-BrownAlex Yee | ![Japan](image) 2020 Tokyo | ![](image) Triathlon | Mixed relay\n |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Tug of war[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Tug of war at the Summer Olympics\n\nGreat Britain's Olympic tug of war debut came when the United Kingdom hosted the Games in 1908.

Tennis in 1896 was a sport that allowed mixed teams, and both Boland and George S. Robertson joined partners from other nations to win their medals. Great Britain again dominated in 1900, taking all four gold medals and adding seven others (three as part of mixed teams).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to official data of the International Olympic Committee.

Currently, Great Britain is the most successful team in women's skeleton, having won a medal six times, and every gold medal from 2010 to 2018. The most successful Winter Olympian from the Great Britain team is Lizzy Yarnold, with two gold medals, both in the women's skeleton.\n\n\n\n\n## Eligibility[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Gold | Richard BudgettMartin CrossAdrian EllisonAndy HolmesSteve Redgrave | ![United States](image) 1984 Los Angeles | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxed four\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Andy HolmesSteve Redgrave | ![South Korea](image) 1988 Seoul | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless pair\n |\n| ![](image) Bronze | Andy HolmesSteve RedgravePatrick Sweeney | ![South Korea](image) 1988 Seoul | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxed pair\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Matthew PinsentSteve Redgrave | ![Spain](image) 1992 Barcelona | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless pair\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Garry HerbertGreg SearleJonny Searle | ![Spain](image) 1992 Barcelona | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxed pair\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Matthew PinsentSteve Redgrave | ![United States](image) 1996 Atlanta | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless pair\n |\n| ![](image) Bronze | Gregory SearleJonathan William SearleRupert John ObholzerTim Foster | ![United States](image) 1996 Atlanta | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless four\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Gold | John BadcockHugh EdwardsJack BeresfordRowland George | ![United States](image) 1932 Los Angeles | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless four\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Jack BeresfordDick Southwood | ![Germany](image) 1936 Berlin | ![](image) Rowing | Men's double sculls\n |\n| ![](image) Silver | Martin BristowAlan BarrettPeter JacksonJohn Sturrock | ![Germany](image) 1936 Berlin | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless four\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | Richard BurnellBertie Bushnell | ![United Kingdom](image) 1948 London | ![](image) Rowing | Men's double sculls\n |\n| ![](image) Gold | John WilsonRan Laurie | ![United Kingdom](image) 1948 London | ![](image) Rowing | Men's coxless pair\n |\n| ![](image) Silver | Christopher BartonMichael LapageGuy RichardsonPaul BircherPaul MasseyBrian LloydJohn MeyrickAlfred MellowsJack Dearlove | ![United Kingdom](image) 1948 London | ![](image) Rowing | Men's eight\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGreat Britain first competed in gymnastics in the inaugural 1896 Olympics, with wrestler Launceston Elliot entering the rope climbing event and finishing last. Great Britain's first gymnastics medal came in 1908 with a silver in the men's individual all-around. Until 2008, Great Britain's last medal for gymnastics was a Bronze in the Women's all-round team event in 1928. At the 2012 Summer Games in London, Great Britain equaled its tally for all previous games combined, winning 4 medals to bring their all-time total to eight. A record seven medals, including first ever gold medals, were won in 2016, while a further three, including one gold, were won at the 2020 Games. Having won only four medals in total between 1896 and 2008, 14 medals, including 3 gold medals were secured between 2012 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Gold | Jess LearmonthJonathan BrownleeGeorgia Taylor-BrownAlex Yee | ![Japan](image) 2020 Tokyo | ![](image) Triathlon | Mixed relay\n |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Tug of war[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Tug of war at the Summer Olympics\n\nGreat Britain's Olympic tug of war debut came when the United Kingdom hosted the Games in 1908.

Germany has hosted three Olympic Games, in 1936 both the Winter and Summer Games, and the 1972 Summer Olympics. In addition, Germany had been selected to host the 1916 Summer Olympics as well as the 1940 Winter Olympics, both of which had to be cancelled due to World Wars. After these wars, Germany was banned from participating in the 1920, 1924 and 1948 Olympics.\n\n\nWhile the country was divided, each of the two German states boycotted one of the Summer Games. In 1980, West Germany was one of 66 nations which did not go to Moscow in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, and in 1984 East Germany joined the Soviet Union and several others in the boycott of the Summer Games in Los Angeles. In 1990, East Germany and West Germany would reunite, with Germany once again competing as a single full sovereign state since the 1992 Olympic year.\n\n\nThe IOC currently splits German results among four codes, even though only the German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1968 to 1988 had sent a separate team to compete against the team of the German NOC that represented Germany (GER) since 1896.\n\n\n\n\n## German post-WW2 division until 1990[edit]\n\n\nAfter German organisations had been dissolved by the Allies in 1947, in 1950 the IOC recognized the reorganized Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Deutschland for all of Germany, based in (West) Germany.\n\n\nDue to the Cold War, an East German state (German Democratic Republic) was created in October 1949, and a separate National Olympic Committee (NOC) for East Germany was established in 1951. It was not immediately recognized by the IOC, which until 1965 required that athletes of the NOC of East Germany join the German team represented by the West Germany-based NOC of Germany. This team, which competed together from 1956 to 1964, is nowadays called the United Team of Germany (*EUA*, \"Equipe Unifiée Allemande\"), but was Germany (*GER*) then. As a result of the Germany being divided, from 1968 to 1990 two independent teams competed in each of the Games; the original designations were *GER* for the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and *GDR* for the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1980 the West German code was changed to *FRG* (which is currently also applied by the IOC in retrospect). After the GDR ceased to exist in 1990 and its states joined the Federal Republic of Germany, Germany once again was represented by a single team, designated *GER*.\n\n\nAdditionally, in the early

NOCs[edit]\n\n\nGermany has competed at the Olympics under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games. Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams. The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the main table. Saar competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals. Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it's possible but not certain Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations.\n\n\n\n![](image)Medals won by Germany at the Summer Olympic Games between 1896 and 2012 (between 1956 and 1964 as the United Team of Germany and between 1968 and 1988 as a sum of medals of West and East Germany)![](image)Medals won by Germany at the Winter Olympic Games between 1928 and 2014 (between 1956 and 1964 as the United Team of Germany and between 1968 and 1988 as sum of medals of West and East Germany)\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics, as of February 20, 2022*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | №\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image)\n | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image)\n | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image)\n | Total\n | №\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image)\n | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image)\n | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image)\n | Total\n | №\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image)\n | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image)\n | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image)\n | Total\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) Germany (GER) | 17 | 201 | 207 | 247 | 655 | 13 | 104 | 98 | 65 | 267 | 30 | 305 | 305 | 312 | 922\n |\n| ![](image) Saar (SAA) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) United Team of Germany (EUA) | 3 | 28 | 54 | 36 | 118 | 3 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 19 | 6 | 36 | 60 | 41 | 137\n |\n| ![](image) East Germany (GDR) | 5 | 153 | 129 | 127 | 409 | 6 | 39 | 36 | 35 | 110 | 11 | 192 | 165 | 162 | 519\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany (FRG) | 5 | 56 | 67 | 81 | 204 | 6 | 11 | 15 | 13 | 39 | 11 | 67 | 82 | 94 | 243\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 438 | 457 | 491 | 1386 | 22 | 162 | 155 | 118 | 435 | 48 | 600 | 612 | 609 | 1821\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Combined IOC codes\n | No. Games\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany (GER)[1] | 30 | 305 | 305 | 312 | 922\n |\n| ![](image) Germany (GER) (EUA) | 36 | 341 | 365 | 353 | 1059\n |\n| ![](image) Germany (GER) (EUA) (FRG) | 47 | 408 | 447 | 447 | 1302\n |\n| ![](image) Germany (GER) (EUA) (FRG) (GDR)[2] | 58[3] | 600 | 612 | 609 | 1821\n |\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\nFor the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, see West Germany at the Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games | Host city | Dates | Nations | Participants | Events\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1936 Winter Olympics | Garmisch-Partenkirchen | 6 – 16 February | 28 | 646 | 17\n |\n| 1936 Summer Olympics | Berlin | 1 – 6 August | 49 | 3,963 | 129\n |\n\n\n### Unsuccessful bids[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | City\n | Winner of bid[4] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1908 Summer Olympics | Berlin | London, United Kingdom\n |\n| 2000 Summer Olympics | Berlin | Sydney, Australia\n |\n| 2012 Summer Olympics | *Leipzig*[a] | London, United Kingdom\n |\n| 2018 Winter Olympics | Munich | Pyeongchang, South Korea\n |\n| 2024 Summer Olympics | Hamburg | Paris, France\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Not shortlisted into candidate stage\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of flag bearers for Germany at the Olympics\n* Category:Olympic competitors for Germany\n* Germany at the Paralympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** International Olympic Committee: Germany\n2. **^** BBC: Timeline: Olympic Powers\n3. **^** Counting the eleven Games where both East Germany (GDR) and West Germany (FRG) competed as two appearances.\n4. **^** \"Past Olympic host city election results\".

Germany has hosted three Olympic Games, in 1936 both the Winter and Summer Games, and the 1972 Summer Olympics. In addition, Germany had been selected to host the 1916 Summer Olympics as well as the 1940 Winter Olympics, both of which had to be cancelled due to World Wars. After these wars, Germany was banned from participating in the 1920, 1924 and 1948 Olympics.\n\n\nWhile the country was divided, each of the two German states boycotted one of the Summer Games. In 1980, West Germany was one of 66 nations which did not go to Moscow in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, and in 1984 East Germany joined the Soviet Union and several others in the boycott of the Summer Games in Los Angeles. In 1990, East Germany and West Germany would reunite, with Germany once again competing as a single full sovereign state since the 1992 Olympic year.\n\n\nThe IOC currently splits German results among four codes, even though only the German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1968 to 1988 had sent a separate team to compete against the team of the German NOC that represented Germany (GER) since 1896.\n\n\n\n\n## German post-WW2 division until 1990[edit]\n\n\nAfter German organisations had been dissolved by the Allies in 1947, in 1950 the IOC recognized the reorganized Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Deutschland for all of Germany, based in (West) Germany.\n\n\nDue to the Cold War, an East German state (German Democratic Republic) was created in October 1949, and a separate National Olympic Committee (NOC) for East Germany was established in 1951. It was not immediately recognized by the IOC, which until 1965 required that athletes of the NOC of East Germany join the German team represented by the West Germany-based NOC of Germany. This team, which competed together from 1956 to 1964, is nowadays called the United Team of Germany (*EUA*, \"Equipe Unifiée Allemande\"), but was Germany (*GER*) then. As a result of the Germany being divided, from 1968 to 1990 two independent teams competed in each of the Games; the original designations were *GER* for the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and *GDR* for the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1980 the West German code was changed to *FRG* (which is currently also applied by the IOC in retrospect). After the GDR ceased to exist in 1990 and its states joined the Federal Republic of Germany, Germany once again was represented by a single team, designated *GER*.\n\n\nAdditionally, in the early 1950s the French-occupied Saar had its own NOC and competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics before joining the German Olympic team in 1956 and the (West) German state by 1957.\n\n\n\n## Overview of

NOCs[edit]\n\n\nGermany has competed at the Olympics under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games. Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams. The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the main table. Saar competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals. Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it's possible but not certain Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations.\n\n\n\n![](image)Medals won by Germany at the Summer Olympic Games between 1896 and 2012 (between 1956 and 1964 as the United Team of Germany and between 1968 and 1988 as a sum of medals of West and East Germany)![](image)Medals won by Germany at the Winter Olympic Games between 1928 and 2014 (between 1956 and 1964 as the United Team of Germany and between 1968 and 1988 as sum of medals of West and East Germany)\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics, as of February 20, 2022*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | №\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image)\n | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image)\n | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image)\n | Total\n | №\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image)\n | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image)\n | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image)\n | Total\n | №\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image)\n | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image)\n | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image)\n | Total\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) Germany (GER) | 17 | 201 | 207 | 247 | 655 | 13 | 104 | 98 | 65 | 267 | 30 | 305 | 305 | 312 | 922\n |\n| ![](image) Saar (SAA) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) United Team of Germany (EUA) | 3 | 28 | 54 | 36 | 118 | 3 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 19 | 6 | 36 | 60 | 41 | 137\n |\n| ![](image) East Germany (GDR) | 5 | 153 | 129 | 127 | 409 | 6 | 39 | 36 | 35 | 110 | 11 | 192 | 165 | 162 | 519\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany (FRG) | 5 | 56 | 67 | 81 | 204 | 6 | 11 | 15 | 13 | 39 | 11 | 67 | 82 | 94 | 243\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 438 | 457 | 491 | 1386 | 22 | 162 | 155 | 118 | 435 | 48 | 600 | 612 | 609 | 1821\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Combined IOC codes\n | No. Games\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany (GER)[1] | 30 | 305 | 305 | 312 | 922\n |\n| ![](image) Germany (GER) (EUA) | 36 | 341 | 365 | 353 | 1059\n |\n| ![](image) Germany (GER) (EUA) (FRG) | 47 | 408 | 447 | 447 | 1302\n |\n| ![](image) Germany (GER) (EUA) (FRG) (GDR)[2] | 58[3] | 600 | 612 | 609 | 1821\n |\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\nFor the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, see West Germany at the Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games | Host city | Dates | Nations | Participants | Events\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1936 Winter Olympics | Garmisch-Partenkirchen | 6 – 16 February | 28 | 646 | 17\n |\n| 1936 Summer Olympics | Berlin | 1 – 6 August | 49 | 3,963 | 129\n |\n\n\n### Unsuccessful bids[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | City\n | Winner of bid[4] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1908 Summer Olympics | Berlin | London, United Kingdom\n |\n| 2000 Summer Olympics | Berlin | Sydney, Australia\n |\n| 2012 Summer Olympics | *Leipzig*[a] | London, United Kingdom\n |\n| 2018 Winter Olympics | Munich | Pyeongchang, South Korea\n |\n| 2024 Summer Olympics | Hamburg | Paris, France\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Not shortlisted into candidate stage\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of flag bearers for Germany at the Olympics\n* Category:Olympic competitors for Germany\n* Germany at the Paralympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** International Olympic Committee: Germany\n2. **^** BBC: Timeline: Olympic Powers\n3. **^** Counting the eleven Games where both East Germany (GDR) and West Germany (FRG) competed as two appearances.\n4. **^** \"Past Olympic host city election results\".

France has competed in every edition (both Summer and Winter), with the possible exception of the 1904 Games (as sources disagree about whether athlete Albert Corey competed for the United States or France[1][2]).\n\n\nFrench athletes have won 751 medals at the Summer Olympic Games in a wide variety of sports, achieving particular success in fencing and cycling.

Aquatics[edit]\n\n\n#### Swimming[edit]\n\n\nFrance first competed in swimming at the Paris 1900 Games, with 47 swimmers taking one gold medal (and five total medals).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n |

Archery[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed in archery in its first Olympic appearance in Paris 1900. The French team there took 13 of the 20 medals, including gold in 4 of the 7 events.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Archers\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 129 | 7/7 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 13\n |\n| Total |  |  | 6 | 11 | 7 | 24\n |\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nFrance first competed in athletics at the inaugural 1896 Games, winning a silver and a bronze. The nation's first gold medal in the sport is a disputed one; Michel Théato was Luxembourgish but living in Paris; his win in the 1900 marathon is credited to France by the International Olympic Committee, which rejected a petition by Luxembourg to change the Olympic record of Théato's nationality.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Athletes\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1896 Athens | 5 | 9/12 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| 1900 Paris | 23 | 18/23 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 7\n |\n| Total |  |  | 14 | 27 | 29 | 70\n |\n\n\n### Basque pelota[edit]\n\n\nIn the only appearance of basque pelota as a medal sport at the Olympics in 1900, the French team (one of only two teams to enter) withdrew shortly before the competition started, and the match was not played. The Spanish pair is credited with the gold medal.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 2 | 1/1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n\n\n### Cricket[edit]\n\n\nFrance is one of two nations to have competed in the only Olympic cricket competition, in 1900.

The nation was a frequent competitor from then through 1996, peaking with a gold medal win in 1984. France did not qualify for the men's tournament from 2000 to 2016, but has qualified for the 2020 Games.\n\n\nFrance did not qualify for the first four women's tournaments from 1996 to 2008. The French women debuted in 2012, placing 4th, and followed that with a 5th-place finish in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 13 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| Total |  |  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2\n |\n\n\n### Golf[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed in the first Olympic golf tournaments in 1900, which the nation hosted. The French golfers' best results that year were 4th place for the women and 10th place for the men. France did not compete in the 1904 golf tournaments.

The nation's first medals in the sport came when Paris hosted the Games in 1900; the only event on the schedule was the men's individual all-around, in which France swept the top 18 places (having 108 of the 135 competing gymnasts).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Gymnasts\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1896 Athens | 1 | 1/8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 1900 Paris | 108 | 1/1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3\n |\n| Total |  |  | 3 | 10 | 9 | 22\n |\n\n\n### Polo[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed at two of the five editions of Olympic polo tournaments, both occasions when Paris hosted the Games in 1900 and 1924. The nation is formally credited with no medals, though French players competed on a mixed team in 1900 (along with a British player) that took bronze. France had a fully-French team as well in 1900, which took fifth place. Both the all-French and the mixed team went 0–1 (losing to the same team), with the mixed team placed higher due to a bye. The French team in 1924 went 0–4 in the round-robin tournament. Thus, the overall Olympic record of teams with French polo players is 0–6.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 7 | 1/1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0[6] |\n| 1924 Paris | 5 | 1/1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0[6] |\n\n\n### Rowing[edit]\n\n\nFrance hosted the inaugural Olympic rowing contests in Paris 1900. France won 2 of the 5 gold medals, and a French boy served as cox in the final for the otherwise Dutch team that won the coxed pair.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Rowers\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 47 | 4/4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 6[7] |\n| Total |  |  | 8 | 15 | 14 | 37\n |\n\n\n### Rugby[edit]\n\n\nFrance hosted the inaugural Olympic rugby union contest in 1900, winning the gold medal over Germany and Great Britain. France did not play in 1908, but returned in 1920 (losing the single match to the United States) and 1924 (beating Romania but losing again to the United States).\n\n\nWith the return of rugby, in the form of rugby sevens, in 2016, France competed again. France had both men's and women's teams in 2016; both advanced out of pool play to the quarterfinals but were defeated there.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 17 | 1/1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 1920 Antwerp | 15 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 1924 Paris | 30 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2016 Rio de Janeiro | 25 | 2/2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3\n |\n\n\n### Sailing[edit]\n\n\nFrance hosted the first Olympic sailing competitions in 1900, earning 24 total medals in the 13 events, including 5 golds.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | No. Sailors\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n | Ranking\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 | *451* | 130/13 | 5 | 9 | 10 | 24 | 1\n |\n| 1908 | 3 | 1/4 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4\n |\n| 1912 | 3 | 1/4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3\n |\n| 1920 | 3 | 1/14 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 6\n |\n| 1924 | 9 | 3/3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 5\n |\n| 1928 | 13 | 3/3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3\n |\n| 1932 | 3 | 2/4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3\n |\n| 1936 | 14 | 4/4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1948 | 17 | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1952 | 9 | 4/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1956 | 8 | 4/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1960 | 11 | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1964 | 3 | 2/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1968 | 9 | 4/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1972 | 11 | 5/6 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2\n |\n| 1976 | 10 | 5/6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1980 | 0 | 0/6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1984 | 11 | 6/7 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 8\n |\n| 1988 | 13 | 7/8 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1\n |\n| 1992 | 17 | 10/10 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2\n |\n| 1996 | 13 | 8/10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 2000 | 12 | 7/11 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 2004 | 18 | 11/11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 7\n |\n| 2008 | 18 | 11/11 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 9\n |\n| 2012 | 16 | 10/10 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 12\n |\n| 2016 | 15 | 10/10 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 6\n |\n| 2020 | 14 | 9/10 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 8\n |\n| Total |  |  | 15 | 14 | 20 | 49 | 4\n |\n\n\n### Shooting[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed in shooting at the inaugural 1896 Games, with one shooter in one event, winning no medals.

France has won an additional 138 medals at the Winter Olympic Games, mostly in alpine skiing.\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\n![France at the Olympics is located in

Aquatics[edit]\n\n\n#### Swimming[edit]\n\n\nFrance first competed in swimming at the Paris 1900 Games, with 47 swimmers taking one gold medal (and five total medals).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n |

Archery[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed in archery in its first Olympic appearance in Paris 1900. The French team there took 13 of the 20 medals, including gold in 4 of the 7 events.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Archers\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 129 | 7/7 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 13\n |\n| Total |  |  | 6 | 11 | 7 | 24\n |\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nFrance first competed in athletics at the inaugural 1896 Games, winning a silver and a bronze. The nation's first gold medal in the sport is a disputed one; Michel Théato was Luxembourgish but living in Paris; his win in the 1900 marathon is credited to France by the International Olympic Committee, which rejected a petition by Luxembourg to change the Olympic record of Théato's nationality.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Athletes\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1896 Athens | 5 | 9/12 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| 1900 Paris | 23 | 18/23 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 7\n |\n| Total |  |  | 14 | 27 | 29 | 70\n |\n\n\n### Basque pelota[edit]\n\n\nIn the only appearance of basque pelota as a medal sport at the Olympics in 1900, the French team (one of only two teams to enter) withdrew shortly before the competition started, and the match was not played. The Spanish pair is credited with the gold medal.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 2 | 1/1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n\n\n### Cricket[edit]\n\n\nFrance is one of two nations to have competed in the only Olympic cricket competition, in 1900.

The nation hosted the first equestrian events in Paris 1900, winning gold medals in two of the five events. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Riders\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 39 | 5/5 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 8\n |\n| Total |  |  | 14 | 13 | 10 | 37\n |\n\n\n### Fencing[edit]\n\n\nFrance has won the second-most gold medals and second-most total medals in fencing, in each case behind Italy.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Fencers\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1896 Athens | 4 | 2/3 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3\n |\n| 1900 Paris | 211 | 7/7 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 15\n |\n| Total |  |  | 42 | 41 | 35 | 118\n |\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed in the first men's Olympic football \"tournament,\" winning one match and losing another to earn a second place finish currently recognized as a silver medal performance. The nation was a frequent competitor from then through 1996, peaking with a gold medal win in 1984. France did not qualify for the men's tournament from 2000 to 2016, but has qualified for the 2020 Games.\n\n\nFrance did not qualify for the first four women's tournaments from 1996 to 2008. The French women debuted in 2012, placing 4th, and followed that with a 5th-place finish in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 13 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| Total |  |  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2\n |\n\n\n### Golf[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed in the first Olympic golf tournaments in 1900, which the nation hosted. The French golfers' best results that year were 4th place for the women and 10th place for the men. France did not compete in the 1904 golf tournaments. When the sport returned to the Olympics in 2016, France had two men and two women compete; the best result was Grégory Bourdy's 21st-place finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Fencers\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 7 | 2/2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2016 Rio de Janeiro | 4 | 2/2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n\n\n### Gymnastics[edit]\n\n\nFrance had one gymnast participate in one event in the inaugural 1896 Games. The nation's first medals in the sport came when Paris hosted the Games in 1900; the only event on the schedule was the men's individual all-around, in which France swept the top 18 places (having 108 of the 135 competing gymnasts).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Gymnasts\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1896 Athens | 1 | 1/8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 1900 Paris | 108 | 1/1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3\n |\n| Total |  |  | 3 | 10 | 9 | 22\n |\n\n\n### Polo[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed at two of the five editions of Olympic polo tournaments, both occasions when Paris hosted the Games in 1900 and 1924. The nation is formally credited with no medals, though French players competed on a mixed team in 1900 (along with a British player) that took bronze. France had a fully-French team as well in 1900, which took fifth place. Both the all-French and the mixed team went 0–1 (losing to the same team), with the mixed team placed higher due to a bye. The French team in 1924 went 0–4 in the round-robin tournament. Thus, the overall Olympic record of teams with French polo players is 0–6.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 7 | 1/1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0[6] |\n| 1924 Paris | 5 | 1/1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0[6] |\n\n\n### Rowing[edit]\n\n\nFrance hosted the inaugural Olympic rowing contests in Paris 1900.

France did not play in 1908, but returned in 1920 (losing the single match to the United States) and 1924 (beating Romania but losing again to the United States).\n\n\nWith the return of rugby, in the form of rugby sevens, in 2016, France competed again. France had both men's and women's teams in 2016; both advanced out of pool play to the quarterfinals but were defeated there.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 17 | 1/1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 1920 Antwerp | 15 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 1924 Paris | 30 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2016 Rio de Janeiro | 25 | 2/2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3\n |\n\n\n### Sailing[edit]\n\n\nFrance hosted the first Olympic sailing competitions in 1900, earning 24 total medals in the 13 events, including 5 golds.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | No. Sailors\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n | Ranking\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 | *451* | 130/13 | 5 | 9 | 10 | 24 | 1\n |\n| 1908 | 3 | 1/4 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4\n |\n| 1912 | 3 | 1/4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3\n |\n| 1920 | 3 | 1/14 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 6\n |\n| 1924 | 9 | 3/3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 5\n |\n| 1928 | 13 | 3/3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3\n |\n| 1932 | 3 | 2/4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3\n |\n| 1936 | 14 | 4/4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1948 | 17 | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1952 | 9 | 4/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1956 | 8 | 4/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1960 | 11 | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1964 | 3 | 2/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1968 | 9 | 4/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1972 | 11 | 5/6 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2\n |\n| 1976 | 10 | 5/6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1980 | 0 | 0/6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1984 | 11 | 6/7 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 8\n |\n| 1988 | 13 | 7/8 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1\n |\n| 1992 | 17 | 10/10 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2\n |\n| 1996 | 13 | 8/10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 2000 | 12 | 7/11 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 2004 | 18 | 11/11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 7\n |\n| 2008 | 18 | 11/11 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 9\n |\n| 2012 | 16 | 10/10 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 12\n |\n| 2016 | 15 | 10/10 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 6\n |\n| 2020 | 14 | 9/10 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 8\n |\n| Total |  |  | 15 | 14 | 20 | 49 | 4\n |\n\n\n### Shooting[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed in shooting at the inaugural 1896 Games, with one shooter in one event, winning no medals.
