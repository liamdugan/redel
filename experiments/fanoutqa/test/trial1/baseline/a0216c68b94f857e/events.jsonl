The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\nEstimation of the World Bank Group for 2021.[3][4][5] Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. The values in the World Bank Group tables are rounded. All calculations were done on raw data, therefore, due to the nuances of rounding, in some places illusory inconsistencies of indicators arose, with a size of 0.01 year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries

expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries &territories\n | 2019\n | 2021\n | 2019→2021 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | Male\n | Female\n | Gendergap |

The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\nEstimation of the World Bank Group for 2021.[3][4][5] Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. The values in the World Bank Group tables are rounded. All calculations were done on raw data, therefore, due to the nuances of rounding, in some places illusory inconsistencies of indicators arose, with a size of 0.01 year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries

expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries &territories\n | 2019\n | 2021\n | 2019→2021 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | Male\n | Female\n | Gendergap |

Open the original svg-file and hover over a bubble to show its data. The square of the bubbles is proportional to country population based on estimation of the UN.\n**Life expectancy** is a statistical measure of the estimate of the span of a life. The most commonly used measure is *life expectancy at birth* (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. *Cohort* LEB is the mean length of life of a birth cohort (in this case, all individuals born in a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born so long ago that all their members have died. *Period* LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort[1][2] assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year.[3] National LEB figures reported by national agencies and international organizations for human populations are estimates of *period* LEB.\n\n\nIn the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, human LEB was 26 years[*citation needed*]; in 2010, world LEB was 67.2 years. In recent years, LEB in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) is 49, while LEB in Japan is 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 would have relatively few people dying at exactly 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity, LEB can be grossly misinterpreted, leading to the belief that a population with a low LEB would have a small proportion of older people.[4] A different measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood. For instance, in a society with a life expectancy of 30, it may nevertheless be common to have a 40-year remaining timespan at age 5 (but perhaps not a 60-year one).\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, infant mortality was approximately 40–60% of the total mortality. Excluding child mortality, the average life expectancy during the 12th–19th centuries was approximately 55 years. If a person survived childhood, they had about a 50% chance of living 50–55 years, instead of only 25–40 years.[5] As of 2016, the overall worldwide life expectancy had reached the highest level that has been measured in modern times.[6]\n\n\nAggregate population measures—such as the proportion of the population in various age groups—are also used alongside individual-based measures—such as formal life expectancy—when analyzing population structure and dynamics. Pre-modern societies had universally higher mortality rates and lower life expectancies at every age for both males and females. This example is relatively rare.\n\n\nLife expectancy, longevity, and maximum lifespan are not synonymous. Longevity refers to the relatively long lifespan of some members of a population. Maximum lifespan is the age at death for the longest-lived individual of a species. Mathematically, life expectancy is denoted \n\n\n\n\ne\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e\\_{x}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle e_{x}}](image) [a] and is the mean number of years of life remaining at a given age \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image), with a particular mortality.[7] Because life expectancy is an average, a particular person may die many years before or after the expected survival.\n\n\nLife expectancy is also used in plant or animal ecology,[8] and in life tables (also known as actuarial tables). The concept of life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects,[9] though the related term[*dubious – discuss*] shelf life is commonly used for consumer products, and the terms \"mean time to breakdown\" and \"mean time between failures\" are used in engineering.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest documented work on life expectancy was done in the 1660s by John Graunt,[10] Christiaan Huygens, and Lodewijck Huygens.[11]\n\n\n\n## Human patterns[edit]\n\n\n### Maximum[edit]\n\n\nThe longest verified lifespan for any human is that of Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who is verified as having lived to age 122 years, 164 days, between 21 February 1875 and 4 August 1997. This is referred to as the \"maximum life span\", which is the upper boundary of life, the maximum number of years any human is known to have lived.[12] A theoretical study shows that the maximum life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ, which is around 104 years.[13] According to a study by biologists Bryan G. Hughes and Siegfried Hekimi, there is no evidence for limit on human lifespan.[14][15] However, this view has been questioned on the basis of error patterns.[16]\n\n\nRecords of human lifespan above age 100 are highly susceptible to errors.[16] For example, the previous world-record holder for human lifespan, Carrie C. White was uncovered as a simple typographic error after more than two decades.[16][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### Variation over time[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Longevity and List of countries by past life expectancy\n\nThe following information is derived from the 1961 *Encyclopædia Britannica* and other sources, some with questionable accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, it represents estimates of the life expectancies of the world population as a whole. In many instances, life expectancy varied considerably according to class and gender.\n\n\nLife expectancy at birth takes account of infant mortality and child mortality but not prenatal mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Era | Life expectancy at birth in years | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Paleolithic | 22–33[17] | Based on the data from modern hunter-gatherer populations, it is estimated that at 15, life expectancy another 39 years (54 years total). There was a 60% probability of surviving until age 15.[18] |\n| Neolithic | 20[19] – 33[20] | Based on Early Neolithic data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–33 years.[21] |\n| Bronze Age and Iron Age[22] | 26 | Based on Early and Middle Bronze Age data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–36 years.[21] |\n| Classical Greece[23] | 25[24] – 28[25] | Based on Athens Agora and Corinth data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 37–41 years.[21] Most Greeks and Romans died young. About half of all children died before adolescence. Those who survived to the age of 30 had a reasonable chance of reaching 50 or 60. The truly elderly, however, were rare. Because so many died in childhood, life expectancy at birth was probably between 20 and 30 years.[26] |\n| Ancient Rome | 20–33\n[27][28][29][26][17][30]\n | Data is lacking, but computer models provide the estimate. If a person survived to age 20, they could expect to live around 30 years more. Life expectancy was probably slightly longer for women than men.[31]\nWhen infant mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 67[27]–75% who survived the first year), life expectancy is around 34–41 more years (i.e. expected to live to 35–42). When child mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 55-65% who survived to age 5), life expectancy is around 40–45 (i.e. age 45–50).[29] The ~50% that reached age 10 could also expect to reach ~45-50;[27] at 15 to ~48–54; at 40 to ~60;[27] at 50 to ~64–68; at 60 to ~70–72; at 70 to ~76–77.[29][31]\n |\n| Wang clan of China, 1st c. AD – 1749 | 35 | For the 60% that survived the first year (i.e. excluding infant mortalities), life expectancy rose to ~35.[32][33] |\n| Early Middle Ages (Europe, from the late 5th or early 6th century to the 10th century) | 30–35 | Life expectancy for those of both sexes who survived birth averaged about 30–35 years. However, if a Gaulish boy made it past age 20, he might expect to live 25 more years, while a woman at age 20 could normally expect about 17 more years. Anyone who survived until 40 had a good chance at another 15 to 20 years.[34] |\n| Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica[35] | >40 | The average Aztec life expectancy was 41.2 years for men and 42.1 for women.\n |\n| Late medieval English peerage[36][37] | 30–33[30] | In Europe, around one-third of infants died in their first year.[17] Once children reached the age of 10, their life expectancy was 32.2 years, and for those who survived to 25, the remaining life expectancy was 23.3 years. Such estimates reflected the life expectancy of adult males from the higher ranks of English society in the Middle Ages, and were similar to that computed for monks of the Christ Church in Canterbury during the 15th century.[30] At age 21, life expectancy of an aristocrat was an additional 43 years (total age 64).[38] |\n| Early modern Britain (16th – 18th century)[22] | 33–40 | For males in the 18th century it was 34 years.[39] For 15-year-old girls: around the 15th – 16th century it was ~33 years (48 total), and in the 18th century it was ~42 (57 total).[40] |\n| 18th-century England[41][17] | 25–40 | For most of the century it ranged from 35 to 40; however, in the 1720s it dipped as low as 25.[41] For 15-year-old girls, it was ~42 (57 total).[40] During the second half of the century it was ~37,[42] while for the elite it passed 40 and approached 50.[32] |\n| Pre-Champlain Canadian Maritimes[43] | 60\n | Samuel de Champlain wrote that in his visits to Mi'kmaq and Huron communities, he met people over 100 years old. Daniel Paul attributes the incredible lifespan in the region to low stress and a healthy diet of lean meats, diverse vegetables, and legumes.[44] |\n| 18th-century Prussia[39] | 24.7 | For males.[39] |\n| 18th-century France[39] | 27.5–30 | For males:[39] 24.8 years in 1740–1749, 27.9 years in 1750–1759, 33.9 years in 1800–1809.[33] |\n| 18th-century American colonies[17] | 28 | Massachusetts colonists who reached the age of 50 could expect to live until 71, and those who were still alive at 60 could expect to reach 75.\n |\n| Beginning of the 19th century[41] | ~29 | Demographic research suggests that at the beginning of the 19th century, no country in the world had a life expectancy longer than 40 years. India was ~25 years, while Belgium was ~40 years.[41] For Europe as a whole, it was ~33 years.[42] |\n| Early 19th-century England[22][41][32] | 40 | For the 84% who survived the first year (i.e. excluding infant mortality), the average age was ~46[32]–48. If they reached 20, then it was ~60; if 50, then ~70; if 70, then ~80.[41] For a 15-year-old girl it was ~60–65.[40] For the upper-class, LEB rose from ~45 to 50.[32]\nLess than half of the people born in the mid-19th century made it past their 50th birthday. In contrast, 97% of the people born in 21st century England and Wales can expect to live longer than 50 years.[41]\n |\n| 19th-century British India[45] | 25.4 |  |\n| 19th-century world average[41] | 28.5–32 | Over the course of the century: Europe rose from ~33 to 43, the Americas from ~35 to 41, Oceania ~35 to 48, Asia ~28, Africa 26.[41] In 1820s France, LEB was ~38, and for the 80% that survived, it rose to ~47. For Moscow serfs, LEB was ~34, and for the 66% that survived, it rose to ~36.[32] Western Europe in 1830 was ~33 years, while for the people of Hau-Lou in China, it was ~40.[42] The LEB for a 10-year-old in Sweden rose from ~44 to ~54.[41] |\n| 1900 world average[46] | 31–32[41] | Around 48 years in Oceania, 43 in Europe, and 41 in the Americas.[41] Around 47 in the U.S.[17] and around 48 for 15-year-old girls in England.[40] |\n| 1950 world average[46] | 45.7–48[41] | Around 60 years in Europe, North America, Oceania, Japan, and parts of South America; but only 41 in Asia and 36 in Africa. Norway led with 72, while in Mali it was merely 26.[41] |\n| 2019–2020 world average | 72.6–73.2 [41][47][48] | * Females: 75.6 years\n* Males: 70.8 years\n* Range: ~54 (Central African Republic) – 85.3 (Hong Kong)[48]\n |\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy[49] increases with age already achieved.\nLife expectancy increases with age as the individual survives the higher mortality rates associated with childhood. For instance, the table above gives the life expectancy at birth among 13th-century English nobles as 30. Having survived to the age of 21, a male member of the English aristocracy in this period could expect to live:[38]\n\n\n\n* 1200–1300: to age 64\n* 1300–1400: to age 45 (because of the bubonic plague)\n* 1400–1500: to age 69\n* 1500–1550: to age 71\n\n\n17th-century English life expectancy was only about 35 years, largely because infant and child mortality remained high. Life expectancy was under 25 years in the early Colony of Virginia,[50] and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40% died before reaching adulthood.[51] During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.[52] The under-5 mortality rate in London decreased from 74.5% (in 1730–1749) to 31.8% (in 1810–1829).[53][54]\n\n\nPublic health measures are credited with much of the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic,[55] the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.[56]\n\n\n\n### Regional variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in 1800, 1950, and 2015 – visualization by Our World in Data\nHuman beings are expected to live on average 30–40 years in Eswatini[57] and 82.6 years in Japan.[b] An analysis published in 2011 in *The Lancet* attributes Japanese life expectancy to equal opportunities, public health, and diet.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plot of life expectancy vs. GDP per capita in 2009. This phenomenon is known as the Preston curve.\n![](image)Graphs of life expectancy at birth for some sub-Saharan countries showing the fall in the 1990s primarily due to the HIV pandemic[61]\nThere are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care, and diet. The impact of AIDS on life expectancy is particularly notable in many African countries. According to projections made by the United Nations in 2002, the life expectancy at birth for 2010–2015 (if HIV/AIDS did not exist) would have been:[62]\n\n\n\n* 70.7 years instead of 31.6 years, Botswana\n* 69.9 years instead of 41.5 years, South Africa\n* 70.5 years instead of 31.8 years, Zimbabwe\n\n\nActual life expectancy in Botswana declined from 65 in 1990 to 49 in 2000 before increasing to 66 in 2011. In South Africa, life expectancy was 63 in 1990, 57 in 2000, and 58 in 2011. And in Zimbabwe, life expectancy was 60 in 1990, 43 in 2000, and 54 in 2011.[63]\n\n\nDuring the last 200 years, African countries have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.[64][65]\n\n\nIn the United States, African-American people have shorter life expectancies than their European-American counterparts. For example, white Americans in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since 1975 at the latest. The greatest difference was 7.1 years in 1993.[66] In contrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years.[67] The life expectancy of Hispanic-Americans is 81.2 years.[66] According to the new government reports in the US, life expectancy in the country dropped again because of the rise in suicide and drug overdose rates. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found nearly 70,000 more Americans died in 2017 than in 2016, with rising rates of death among 25- to 44-year-olds.[68]\n\n\nCities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In United States cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high-income neighborhoods touches 20 years.[69]\n\n\n\n### Economic circumstances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy is higher in rich countries with low economic inequality.[70]\n![](image)Life expectancy vs healthcare spending of rich OECD countries. US average of $10,447 in 2018.[71]\nEconomic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas.[72] In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only 8 km (5.0 mi) away.[73][74]\n\n\nA 2013 study found a pronounced relationship between economic inequality and life expectancy.[75] However, in contrast, a study by José A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually *increased* during the Great Depression, and during recessions and depressions in general.[76] The authors suggest that when people are working at a more extreme degree during prosperous economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and the likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.\n\n\nLife expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expectancies than average. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet, and exercise.\n\n\n\n### Sex differences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pink: Countries where female life expectancy at birth is higher than males. Blue: A few countries in southern Africa where females have shorter lives due to AIDS.[77]\nIn the present, female human life expectancy is greater than that of males, despite females having higher morbidity rates (see Health survival paradox). There are many potential reasons for this. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol, and drugs than women in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.[78] Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war, or car wrecks) or intentional (suicide).[78] Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease.[12] These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer. In the past, mortality rates for females in child-bearing age groups were higher than for males at the same age.\n\n\nA paper from 2015 found that female foetuses have a higher mortality rate than male foetuses.[79] This finding contradicts papers dating from 2002 and earlier that attribute the male sex to higher in-utero mortality rates.[80][81][82] Among the smallest premature babies (those under 2 pounds (910 grams)), females have a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States dropped from 7.8 years in 1979 to 5.3 years in 2005, with women expected to live to age 80.1 in 2005.[83] Data from the United Kingdom shows the gap in life expectancy between men and women decreasing in later life. This may be attributable to the effects of infant mortality and young adult death rates.[84]\n\n\nSome argue that shorter male life expectancy is merely another manifestation of the general rule, seen in all mammal species, that larger-sized individuals within a species tend, on average, to have shorter lives.[85][86] This biological difference[*clarification needed*] occurs because women have more resistance to infections and degenerative diseases.[12]\n\n\nIn her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. However, Kalben's study was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where the demographic transition occurred relatively early. United Nations statistics from mid-twentieth century onward, show that in all parts of the world, females have a higher life expectancy at age 60 than males.[87] Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. Except for birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.[88]\n\n\nOne recent suggestion is that mitochondrial mutations which shorten lifespan continue to be expressed in males (but less so in females) because mitochondria are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival; therefore, such mitochondria are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. This thus suggests that females tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.[89][90]\n\n\nAnother explanation is the unguarded X hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, one reason for why the average lifespan of males isn't as long as that of females––by 18% on average, according to the study––is that they have a Y chromosome which can't protect an individual from harmful genes expressed on the X chromosome, while a duplicate X chromosome, as present in female organisms, can ensure harmful genes aren't expressed.[91][92]\n\n\nIn developed countries, starting around 1880, death rates decreased faster among women, leading to differences in mortality rates between males and females. Before 1880, death rates were the same. In people born after 1900, the death rate of 50- to 70-year-old men was double that of women of the same age. Men may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease than women, but this susceptibility was evident only after deaths from other causes, such as infections, started to decline.[93] Most of the difference in life expectancy between the sexes is accounted for by differences in the rate of death by cardiovascular diseases among persons aged 50–70.[94]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Genetics of aging\n\nThe heritability of lifespan is estimated to be less than 10%, meaning the majority of variation in lifespan is attributable due to differences in environment rather than genetic variation.[95] However, researchers have identified regions of the genome which can influence the length of life and the number of years lived in good health. For example, a genome-wide association study of 1 million lifespans found 12 genetic loci which influenced lifespan by modifying susceptibility to cardiovascular and smoking-related disease.[96] The locus with the largest effect is APOE. Carriers of the APOE ε4 allele live approximately one year less than average (per copy of the ε4 allele), mainly due to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Healthspan, parental lifespan, and longevity are highly genetically correlated.\"[97]\nIn July 2020, scientists identified 10 genomic loci with consistent effects across multiple lifespan-related traits, including healthspan, lifespan, and longevity.[97] The genes affected by variation in these loci highlighted haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field. This study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce, and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans.[98]\n\n\nA follow-up study which investigated the genetics of frailty and self-rated health in addition to healthspan, lifespan, and longevity also highlighted haem metabolism as an important pathway, and found genetic variants which lower blood protein levels of LPA and VCAM1 were associated with increased healthy lifespan.[99]\n\n\n\n### Centenarians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Centenarian\n\nIn developed countries, the number of centenarians is increasing at approximately 5.5% per year, which means doubling the centenarian population every 13 years, pushing it from some 455,000 in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2050.[100] Japan is the country with the highest ratio of centenarians (347 for every 1 million inhabitants in September 2010). Shimane Prefecture had an estimated 743 centenarians per million inhabitants.[101]\n\n\nIn the United States, the number of centenarians grew from 32,194 in 1980 to 71,944 in November 2010 (232 centenarians per million inhabitants).[102]\n\n\n\n### Mental illness[edit]\n\n\nMental illness is reported to occur in approximately 18% of the average American population.[103][104]\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in the seriously mentally ill is much shorter than the general population.[105]\nThe mentally ill have been shown to have a 10- to 25-year reduction in life expectancy.[106] Generally, the reduction of lifespan in the mentally ill population compared to the mentally stable population has been studied and documented.[107][108][109][110][111]\n\n\nThe greater mortality of people with mental disorders may be due to death from injury, from co-morbid conditions, or medication side effects.[112] For instance, psychiatric medications can increase the risk of developing diabetes.[113][114][115][116] It has been shown that the psychiatric medication olanzapine can increase risk of developing agranulocytosis, among other comorbidities.[117][118] Psychiatric medicines also affect the gastrointestinal tract; the mentally ill have a four times risk of gastrointestinal disease.[119][120][121]\n\n\nAs of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found an increased risk of death in the mentally ill.[122][123][124]\n\n\n\n### Other illnesses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Post-COVID life expectancy in the US, UK, Netherlands, and Austria\nThe life expectancy of people with diabetes, which is 9.3% of the U.S. population, is reduced by roughly 10–20 years.[125][126] People over 60 years old with Alzheimer's disease have about a 50% life expectancy of 3–10 years.[127] Other demographics that tend to have a lower life expectancy than average include transplant recipients[128] and the obese.[129]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nEducation on all levels has been shown to be strongly associated with increased life expectancy.[130] This association may be due partly to higher income,[131] which can lead to increased life expectancy. Despite the association, among identical twin pairs with different education levels, there is only weak evidence of a relationship between educational attainment and adult mortality.[130]\n\n\nAccording to a paper from 2015, the mortality rate for the Caucasian population in the United States from 1993 to 2001 is four times higher[*dubious – discuss*] for those who did not complete high school compared to those who have at least 16 years of education.[130] In fact, within the U.S. adult population, people with less than a high school education have the shortest life expectancies.\n\n\nPreschool education also plays a large role in life expectancy. It was found that high-quality early-stage childhood education had positive effects on health. Researchers discovered this by analyzing the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, finding that the disadvantaged children who were randomly assigned to treatment had lower instances of risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in their mid-30s.[132]\n\n\n\n## Evolution and aging rate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life history theory\n\nVarious species of plants and animals, including humans, have different lifespans. Evolutionary theory states that organisms which—by virtue of their defenses or lifestyle—live for long periods and avoid accidents, disease, predation, etc. are likely to have genes that code for slow aging, which often translates to good cellular repair. One theory is that if predation or accidental deaths prevent most individuals from living to an old age, there will be less natural selection to increase the intrinsic life span.[133] That finding was supported in a classic study of opossums by Austad;[134] however, the opposite relationship was found in an equally prominent study of guppies by Reznick.[135][136]\n\n\nOne prominent and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction.[137] Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span from a very limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy.[138][139][140] That is the key to why animals like giant tortoises can live so long.[141] Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe ability of skin fibroblasts to perform DNA repair after UV irradiation was measured in shrew, mouse, rat, hamster, cow, elephant and human.[142] It was found that DNA repair capability increased systematically with species life span. Since this original study in 1974, at least 14 additional studies were performed on mammals to test this correlation.[143] In all, but two of these studies, lifespan correlated with DNA repair levels, suggesting that DNA repair capability contributes to life expectancy.[143]\n\n\nIn a broad survey of zoo animals, no relationship was found between investment of the animal in reproduction and its life span.[144]\n\n\n\n## Calculation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Life table § The mathematics\n\n![](image)A survival tree to explain the calculations of life-expectancy.

It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\n\n\nThe starting point for calculating life expectancy is the age-specific death rates of the population members. If a large amount of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years \"exposed to risk\" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to remove (as much as possible) the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used.[147] The most common modern methods include:\n\n\n\n* fitting a mathematical formula (such as the Gompertz function, or an extension of it) to the data.\n* looking at an established mortality table derived from a larger population and making a simple adjustment to it (such as multiplying by a constant factor) to fit the data. (In cases of relatively small amounts of data.)\n* looking at the mortality rates actually experienced at each age and applying a piecewise model (such as by cubic splines) to fit the data. (In cases of relatively large amounts of data.)\n\n\nThe age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, or smokers and non-smokers) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them.[148] The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications (e.g. aircraft), methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.[9]\n\n\nIt is important to note that the life expectancy statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends, but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality, like the Lee–Carter model.[149]\n\n\nAs discussed above, on an individual basis, some factors correlate with longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use (including smoking and alcohol consumption), disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care.[12]\n\n\n\n## Healthy life expectancy[edit]\n\n\nTo assess the quality of these additional years of life, 'healthy life expectancy' has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called **Healthy life expectancy** (**HALE**), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury.[150][151] Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan \"Healthy People 2010\". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.\n\n\n\n![Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries](image)Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries\nThe long-standing quest for longer life led in the 2010s to a more promising focus on increasing HALE, also known as a person's \"healthspan\". Besides the benefits of keeping people healthier longer, a goal is to reduce health-care expenses on the many diseases associated with cellular senescence. Approaches being explored include fasting, exercise, and senolytic drugs.[152]\n\n\n\n## Forecasting[edit]\n\n\nForecasting life expectancy and mortality form an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs (like U.S. Social Security and pension) since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.\n\n\nLife expectancy forecasting is usually based on one of two different approaches:\n\n\n\n1. Forecasting the life expectancy directly, generally using ARIMA or other time-series extrapolation procedures. This has the advantage of simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other life table results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach can be done with any common statistical/mathematical software package, like EViews, R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, or SPSS.\n2. Forecasting age-specific death rates and computing the life expectancy from the results with life table methods. This is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated age-specific mortality rates, but it seems to be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age-specific rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach in this group is the Lee-Carter model,[153] which uses the singular value decomposition on a set of transformed age-specific mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series, and then recovers a full set of age-specific mortality rates from that forecasted value. The software includes Professor Rob J. Hyndman's R package called 'demography' and UC Berkeley's LCFIT system.\n\n\n## Policy uses[edit]\n\n\nLife expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.[154]\n\n\nLife expectancy is used in describing the physical quality of life of an area. It is also used for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy is sold for a cash asset.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nDisparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907).[155] There is a similar relationship among states in the U.S. (r = −0.620).[156]\n\n\n\n## Life expectancy vs. other measures of longevity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Remaining\" life expectancy—expected number of remaining years of life as a function of *current age*—is used in retirement income planning.[49]\nLife expectancy is commonly confused with the average age an adult could expect to live. This confusion may create the expectation that an adult would be unlikely to exceed an life expectancy, even though, with all statistical probability, an adult, who has already avoided many statistical causes of adolescent mortality, should be expected to outlive the life expectancy calculated from birth.[157] One must compare the life expectancy of the period after childhood to estimate also the life expectancy of an adult.[157]\n\n\n  \n\nLife expectancy can change dramatically after childhood. In the table above, note the life expectancy *at birth* in the Paleolithic is 22–33 years, but life expectancy at 15 is 54 years. Additional studies similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.[158][159]\n\n\nMaximum life span is an individual-specific concept, and therefore is an upper bound rather than an average.[157] Science author Christopher Wanjek writes, \"[H]as the human race increased its life span? Not at all. This is one of the biggest misconceptions about old age: we are not living any longer.\" The maximum life span, or oldest age a human can live, may be constant.[157] Further, there are many examples of people living significantly longer than the average life expectancy of their time period, such as Socrates (71), Saint Anthony the Great (105), Michelangelo (88), and John Adams (90).[157]\n\n\nHowever, anthropologist John D. Hawks criticizes the popular conflation of life span (life expectancy) and maximum life span when popular science writers falsely imply that the average adult human does not live longer than their ancestors. He writes, \"[a]ge-specific mortality rates have declined across the adult lifespan. A smaller fraction of adults die at 20, at 30, at 40, at 50, and so on across the lifespan. As a result, we live longer on average... In every way we can measure, human lifespans are longer today than in the immediate past, and longer today than they were 2000 years ago... age-specific mortality rates in adults really have reduced substantially.\"[160]\n\n\nLife expectancy can also create popular misconceptions about at what age a certain population may expect to die at. The modal age at death is the age when most deaths occur in a population, and is sometimes used instead of life expectancy for this kind of understanding. For example, in the table above, life expectancy in the Paleolithic is listed as 22–33 years. For many, this implies that most people in the Paleolithic died in their late twenties. However, in the Paleolithic, most adults in the Paleolithic died at *72 years* (the average modal adult life span).[161]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biodemography\n* Calorie restriction\n* Demography\n* Depreciation\n* DNA damage theory of aging\n* Glasgow effect\n* Health equity\n* Life extension\n* Life table\n* Lindy effect\n* List of countries by life expectancy\n* List of countries by past life expectancy\n* List of longest-living organisms\n* LGBT life expectancy\n* Maximum life span\n* Medieval demography\n* Mitohormesis\n* Mortality rate\n* Population pyramid\n* Senescence\n\n### Increasing life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n* Strategies for engineered negligible senescence (SENS)\n* John Sperling\n* Life extension\n* Longevity\n* Rejuvenation\n* Public health\n* Infant mortality\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In standard actuarial notation, *ex* refers to the expected future lifetime of *(x)* in whole years, while *eͦx* (with a ring above the *e*) denotes the complete expected future lifetime of *(x)*, including the fraction.\n2. **^** Japan's recorded life expectancy may have been very slightly increased by counting many infant deaths as stillborn.[58]\n3. **^**  Note the different units: a probability is unit-less, whereas a mortality rate has units (such as deaths per population per year).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"\"Life Expectancy\" – What does this actually mean?\". *Our World in Data*.

Open the original svg-file and hover over a bubble to show its data. The square of the bubbles is proportional to country population based on estimation of the UN.\n**Life expectancy** is a statistical measure of the estimate of the span of a life. The most commonly used measure is *life expectancy at birth* (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. *Cohort* LEB is the mean length of life of a birth cohort (in this case, all individuals born in a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born so long ago that all their members have died. *Period* LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort[1][2] assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year.[3] National LEB figures reported by national agencies and international organizations for human populations are estimates of *period* LEB.\n\n\nIn the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, human LEB was 26 years[*citation needed*]; in 2010, world LEB was 67.2 years. In recent years, LEB in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) is 49, while LEB in Japan is 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 would have relatively few people dying at exactly 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity, LEB can be grossly misinterpreted, leading to the belief that a population with a low LEB would have a small proportion of older people.[4] A different measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood. For instance, in a society with a life expectancy of 30, it may nevertheless be common to have a 40-year remaining timespan at age 5 (but perhaps not a 60-year one).\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, infant mortality was approximately 40–60% of the total mortality. Excluding child mortality, the average life expectancy during the 12th–19th centuries was approximately 55 years. If a person survived childhood, they had about a 50% chance of living 50–55 years, instead of only 25–40 years.[5] As of 2016, the overall worldwide life expectancy had reached the highest level that has been measured in modern times.[6]\n\n\nAggregate population measures—such as the proportion of the population in various age groups—are also used alongside individual-based measures—such as formal life expectancy—when analyzing population structure and dynamics. Pre-modern societies had universally higher mortality rates and lower life expectancies at every age for both males and females. This example is relatively rare.\n\n\nLife expectancy, longevity, and maximum lifespan are not synonymous. Longevity refers to the relatively long lifespan of some members of a population. Maximum lifespan is the age at death for the longest-lived individual of a species. Mathematically, life expectancy is denoted \n\n\n\n\ne\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e\\_{x}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle e_{x}}](image) [a] and is the mean number of years of life remaining at a given age \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image), with a particular mortality.[7] Because life expectancy is an average, a particular person may die many years before or after the expected survival.\n\n\nLife expectancy is also used in plant or animal ecology,[8] and in life tables (also known as actuarial tables). The concept of life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects,[9] though the related term[*dubious – discuss*] shelf life is commonly used for consumer products, and the terms \"mean time to breakdown\" and \"mean time between failures\" are used in engineering.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest documented work on life expectancy was done in the 1660s by John Graunt,[10] Christiaan Huygens, and Lodewijck Huygens.[11]\n\n\n\n## Human patterns[edit]\n\n\n### Maximum[edit]\n\n\nThe longest verified lifespan for any human is that of Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who is verified as having lived to age 122 years, 164 days, between 21 February 1875 and 4 August 1997. This is referred to as the \"maximum life span\", which is the upper boundary of life, the maximum number of years any human is known to have lived.[12] A theoretical study shows that the maximum life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ, which is around 104 years.[13] According to a study by biologists Bryan G. Hughes and Siegfried Hekimi, there is no evidence for limit on human lifespan.[14][15] However, this view has been questioned on the basis of error patterns.[16]\n\n\nRecords of human lifespan above age 100 are highly susceptible to errors.[16] For example, the previous world-record holder for human lifespan, Carrie C. White was uncovered as a simple typographic error after more than two decades.[16][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### Variation over time[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Longevity and List of countries by past life expectancy\n\nThe following information is derived from the 1961 *Encyclopædia Britannica* and other sources, some with questionable accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, it represents estimates of the life expectancies of the world population as a whole. In many instances, life expectancy varied considerably according to class and gender.\n\n\nLife expectancy at birth takes account of infant mortality and child mortality but not prenatal mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Era | Life expectancy at birth in years | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Paleolithic | 22–33[17] | Based on the data from modern hunter-gatherer populations, it is estimated that at 15, life expectancy another 39 years (54 years total). There was a 60% probability of surviving until age 15.[18] |\n| Neolithic | 20[19] – 33[20] | Based on Early Neolithic data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–33 years.[21] |\n| Bronze Age and Iron Age[22] | 26 | Based on Early and Middle Bronze Age data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–36 years.[21] |\n| Classical Greece[23] | 25[24] – 28[25] | Based on Athens Agora and Corinth data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 37–41 years.[21] Most Greeks and Romans died young. About half of all children died before adolescence. Those who survived to the age of 30 had a reasonable chance of reaching 50 or 60. The truly elderly, however, were rare. Because so many died in childhood, life expectancy at birth was probably between 20 and 30 years.[26] |\n| Ancient Rome | 20–33\n[27][28][29][26][17][30]\n | Data is lacking, but computer models provide the estimate. If a person survived to age 20, they could expect to live around 30 years more. Life expectancy was probably slightly longer for women than men.[31]\nWhen infant mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 67[27]–75% who survived the first year), life expectancy is around 34–41 more years (i.e. expected to live to 35–42). When child mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 55-65% who survived to age 5), life expectancy is around 40–45 (i.e. age 45–50).[29] The ~50% that reached age 10 could also expect to reach ~45-50;[27] at 15 to ~48–54; at 40 to ~60;[27] at 50 to ~64–68; at 60 to ~70–72; at 70 to ~76–77.[29][31]\n |\n| Wang clan of China, 1st c. AD – 1749 | 35 | For the 60% that survived the first year (i.e. excluding infant mortalities), life expectancy rose to ~35.[32][33] |\n| Early Middle Ages (Europe, from the late 5th or early 6th century to the 10th century) | 30–35 | Life expectancy for those of both sexes who survived birth averaged about 30–35 years. However, if a Gaulish boy made it past age 20, he might expect to live 25 more years, while a woman at age 20 could normally expect about 17 more years. Anyone who survived until 40 had a good chance at another 15 to 20 years.[34] |\n| Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica[35] | >40 | The average Aztec life expectancy was 41.2 years for men and 42.1 for women.\n |\n| Late medieval English peerage[36][37] | 30–33[30] | In Europe, around one-third of infants died in their first year.[17] Once children reached the age of 10, their life expectancy was 32.2 years, and for those who survived to 25, the remaining life expectancy was 23.3 years. Such estimates reflected the life expectancy of adult males from the higher ranks of English society in the Middle Ages, and were similar to that computed for monks of the Christ Church in Canterbury during the 15th century.[30] At age 21, life expectancy of an aristocrat was an additional 43 years (total age 64).[38] |\n| Early modern Britain (16th – 18th century)[22] | 33–40 | For males in the 18th century it was 34 years.[39] For 15-year-old girls: around the 15th – 16th century it was ~33 years (48 total), and in the 18th century it was ~42 (57 total).[40] |\n| 18th-century England[41][17] | 25–40 | For most of the century it ranged from 35 to 40; however, in the 1720s it dipped as low as 25.[41] For 15-year-old girls, it was ~42 (57 total).[40] During the second half of the century it was ~37,[42] while for the elite it passed 40 and approached 50.[32] |\n| Pre-Champlain Canadian Maritimes[43] | 60\n | Samuel de Champlain wrote that in his visits to Mi'kmaq and Huron communities, he met people over 100 years old. Daniel Paul attributes the incredible lifespan in the region to low stress and a healthy diet of lean meats, diverse vegetables, and legumes.[44] |\n| 18th-century Prussia[39] | 24.7 | For males.[39] |\n| 18th-century France[39] | 27.5–30 | For males:[39] 24.8 years in 1740–1749, 27.9 years in 1750–1759, 33.9 years in 1800–1809.[33] |\n| 18th-century American colonies[17] | 28 | Massachusetts colonists who reached the age of 50 could expect to live until 71, and those who were still alive at 60 could expect to reach 75.\n |\n| Beginning of the 19th century[41] | ~29 | Demographic research suggests that at the beginning of the 19th century, no country in the world had a life expectancy longer than 40 years. India was ~25 years, while Belgium was ~40 years.[41] For Europe as a whole, it was ~33 years.[42] |\n| Early 19th-century England[22][41][32] | 40 | For the 84% who survived the first year (i.e. excluding infant mortality), the average age was ~46[32]–48. If they reached 20, then it was ~60; if 50, then ~70; if 70, then ~80.[41] For a 15-year-old girl it was ~60–65.[40] For the upper-class, LEB rose from ~45 to 50.[32]\nLess than half of the people born in the mid-19th century made it past their 50th birthday. In contrast, 97% of the people born in 21st century England and Wales can expect to live longer than 50 years.[41]\n |\n| 19th-century British India[45] | 25.4 |  |\n| 19th-century world average[41] | 28.5–32 | Over the course of the century: Europe rose from ~33 to 43, the Americas from ~35 to 41, Oceania ~35 to 48, Asia ~28, Africa 26.[41] In 1820s France, LEB was ~38, and for the 80% that survived, it rose to ~47. For Moscow serfs, LEB was ~34, and for the 66% that survived, it rose to ~36.[32] Western Europe in 1830 was ~33 years, while for the people of Hau-Lou in China, it was ~40.[42] The LEB for a 10-year-old in Sweden rose from ~44 to ~54.[41] |\n| 1900 world average[46] | 31–32[41] | Around 48 years in Oceania, 43 in Europe, and 41 in the Americas.[41] Around 47 in the U.S.[17] and around 48 for 15-year-old girls in England.[40] |\n| 1950 world average[46] | 45.7–48[41] | Around 60 years in Europe, North America, Oceania, Japan, and parts of South America; but only 41 in Asia and 36 in Africa. Norway led with 72, while in Mali it was merely 26.[41] |\n| 2019–2020 world average | 72.6–73.2 [41][47][48] | * Females: 75.6 years\n* Males: 70.8 years\n* Range: ~54 (Central African Republic) – 85.3 (Hong Kong)[48]\n |\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy[49] increases with age already achieved.\nLife expectancy increases with age as the individual survives the higher mortality rates associated with childhood. For instance, the table above gives the life expectancy at birth among 13th-century English nobles as 30. Having survived to the age of 21, a male member of the English aristocracy in this period could expect to live:[38]\n\n\n\n* 1200–1300: to age 64\n* 1300–1400: to age 45 (because of the bubonic plague)\n* 1400–1500: to age 69\n* 1500–1550: to age 71\n\n\n17th-century English life expectancy was only about 35 years, largely because infant and child mortality remained high. Life expectancy was under 25 years in the early Colony of Virginia,[50] and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40% died before reaching adulthood.[51] During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.[52] The under-5 mortality rate in London decreased from 74.5% (in 1730–1749) to 31.8% (in 1810–1829).[53][54]\n\n\nPublic health measures are credited with much of the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic,[55] the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.[56]\n\n\n\n### Regional variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in 1800, 1950, and 2015 – visualization by Our World in Data\nHuman beings are expected to live on average 30–40 years in Eswatini[57] and 82.6 years in Japan.[b] An analysis published in 2011 in *The Lancet* attributes Japanese life expectancy to equal opportunities, public health, and diet.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plot of life expectancy vs. GDP per capita in 2009. This phenomenon is known as the Preston curve.\n![](image)Graphs of life expectancy at birth for some sub-Saharan countries showing the fall in the 1990s primarily due to the HIV pandemic[61]\nThere are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care, and diet. The impact of AIDS on life expectancy is particularly notable in many African countries. According to projections made by the United Nations in 2002, the life expectancy at birth for 2010–2015 (if HIV/AIDS did not exist) would have been:[62]\n\n\n\n* 70.7 years instead of 31.6 years, Botswana\n* 69.9 years instead of 41.5 years, South Africa\n* 70.5 years instead of 31.8 years, Zimbabwe\n\n\nActual life expectancy in Botswana declined from 65 in 1990 to 49 in 2000 before increasing to 66 in 2011. In South Africa, life expectancy was 63 in 1990, 57 in 2000, and 58 in 2011. And in Zimbabwe, life expectancy was 60 in 1990, 43 in 2000, and 54 in 2011.[63]\n\n\nDuring the last 200 years, African countries have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.[64][65]\n\n\nIn the United States, African-American people have shorter life expectancies than their European-American counterparts. For example, white Americans in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since 1975 at the latest. The greatest difference was 7.1 years in 1993.[66] In contrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years.[67] The life expectancy of Hispanic-Americans is 81.2 years.[66] According to the new government reports in the US, life expectancy in the country dropped again because of the rise in suicide and drug overdose rates. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found nearly 70,000 more Americans died in 2017 than in 2016, with rising rates of death among 25- to 44-year-olds.[68]\n\n\nCities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In United States cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high-income neighborhoods touches 20 years.[69]\n\n\n\n### Economic circumstances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy is higher in rich countries with low economic inequality.[70]\n![](image)Life expectancy vs healthcare spending of rich OECD countries. US average of $10,447 in 2018.[71]\nEconomic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas.[72] In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only 8 km (5.0 mi) away.[73][74]\n\n\nA 2013 study found a pronounced relationship between economic inequality and life expectancy.[75] However, in contrast, a study by José A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually *increased* during the Great Depression, and during recessions and depressions in general.[76] The authors suggest that when people are working at a more extreme degree during prosperous economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and the likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.\n\n\nLife expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expectancies than average. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet, and exercise.\n\n\n\n### Sex differences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pink: Countries where female life expectancy at birth is higher than males. Blue: A few countries in southern Africa where females have shorter lives due to AIDS.[77]\nIn the present, female human life expectancy is greater than that of males, despite females having higher morbidity rates (see Health survival paradox). There are many potential reasons for this. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol, and drugs than women in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.[78] Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war, or car wrecks) or intentional (suicide).[78] Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease.[12] These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer. In the past, mortality rates for females in child-bearing age groups were higher than for males at the same age.\n\n\nA paper from 2015 found that female foetuses have a higher mortality rate than male foetuses.[79] This finding contradicts papers dating from 2002 and earlier that attribute the male sex to higher in-utero mortality rates.[80][81][82] Among the smallest premature babies (those under 2 pounds (910 grams)), females have a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States dropped from 7.8 years in 1979 to 5.3 years in 2005, with women expected to live to age 80.1 in 2005.[83] Data from the United Kingdom shows the gap in life expectancy between men and women decreasing in later life. This may be attributable to the effects of infant mortality and young adult death rates.[84]\n\n\nSome argue that shorter male life expectancy is merely another manifestation of the general rule, seen in all mammal species, that larger-sized individuals within a species tend, on average, to have shorter lives.[85][86] This biological difference[*clarification needed*] occurs because women have more resistance to infections and degenerative diseases.[12]\n\n\nIn her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. However, Kalben's study was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where the demographic transition occurred relatively early. United Nations statistics from mid-twentieth century onward, show that in all parts of the world, females have a higher life expectancy at age 60 than males.[87] Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. Except for birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.[88]\n\n\nOne recent suggestion is that mitochondrial mutations which shorten lifespan continue to be expressed in males (but less so in females) because mitochondria are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival; therefore, such mitochondria are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. This thus suggests that females tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.[89][90]\n\n\nAnother explanation is the unguarded X hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, one reason for why the average lifespan of males isn't as long as that of females––by 18% on average, according to the study––is that they have a Y chromosome which can't protect an individual from harmful genes expressed on the X chromosome, while a duplicate X chromosome, as present in female organisms, can ensure harmful genes aren't expressed.[91][92]\n\n\nIn developed countries, starting around 1880, death rates decreased faster among women, leading to differences in mortality rates between males and females. Before 1880, death rates were the same. In people born after 1900, the death rate of 50- to 70-year-old men was double that of women of the same age. Men may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease than women, but this susceptibility was evident only after deaths from other causes, such as infections, started to decline.[93] Most of the difference in life expectancy between the sexes is accounted for by differences in the rate of death by cardiovascular diseases among persons aged 50–70.[94]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Genetics of aging\n\nThe heritability of lifespan is estimated to be less than 10%, meaning the majority of variation in lifespan is attributable due to differences in environment rather than genetic variation.[95] However, researchers have identified regions of the genome which can influence the length of life and the number of years lived in good health. For example, a genome-wide association study of 1 million lifespans found 12 genetic loci which influenced lifespan by modifying susceptibility to cardiovascular and smoking-related disease.[96] The locus with the largest effect is APOE. Carriers of the APOE ε4 allele live approximately one year less than average (per copy of the ε4 allele), mainly due to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Healthspan, parental lifespan, and longevity are highly genetically correlated.\"[97]\nIn July 2020, scientists identified 10 genomic loci with consistent effects across multiple lifespan-related traits, including healthspan, lifespan, and longevity.[97] The genes affected by variation in these loci highlighted haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field. This study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce, and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans.[98]\n\n\nA follow-up study which investigated the genetics of frailty and self-rated health in addition to healthspan, lifespan, and longevity also highlighted haem metabolism as an important pathway, and found genetic variants which lower blood protein levels of LPA and VCAM1 were associated with increased healthy lifespan.[99]\n\n\n\n### Centenarians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Centenarian\n\nIn developed countries, the number of centenarians is increasing at approximately 5.5% per year, which means doubling the centenarian population every 13 years, pushing it from some 455,000 in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2050.[100] Japan is the country with the highest ratio of centenarians (347 for every 1 million inhabitants in September 2010). Shimane Prefecture had an estimated 743 centenarians per million inhabitants.[101]\n\n\nIn the United States, the number of centenarians grew from 32,194 in 1980 to 71,944 in November 2010 (232 centenarians per million inhabitants).[102]\n\n\n\n### Mental illness[edit]\n\n\nMental illness is reported to occur in approximately 18% of the average American population.[103][104]\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in the seriously mentally ill is much shorter than the general population.[105]\nThe mentally ill have been shown to have a 10- to 25-year reduction in life expectancy.[106] Generally, the reduction of lifespan in the mentally ill population compared to the mentally stable population has been studied and documented.[107][108][109][110][111]\n\n\nThe greater mortality of people with mental disorders may be due to death from injury, from co-morbid conditions, or medication side effects.[112] For instance, psychiatric medications can increase the risk of developing diabetes.[113][114][115][116] It has been shown that the psychiatric medication olanzapine can increase risk of developing agranulocytosis, among other comorbidities.[117][118] Psychiatric medicines also affect the gastrointestinal tract; the mentally ill have a four times risk of gastrointestinal disease.[119][120][121]\n\n\nAs of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found an increased risk of death in the mentally ill.[122][123][124]\n\n\n\n### Other illnesses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Post-COVID life expectancy in the US, UK, Netherlands, and Austria\nThe life expectancy of people with diabetes, which is 9.3% of the U.S. population, is reduced by roughly 10–20 years.[125][126] People over 60 years old with Alzheimer's disease have about a 50% life expectancy of 3–10 years.[127] Other demographics that tend to have a lower life expectancy than average include transplant recipients[128] and the obese.[129]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nEducation on all levels has been shown to be strongly associated with increased life expectancy.[130] This association may be due partly to higher income,[131] which can lead to increased life expectancy. Despite the association, among identical twin pairs with different education levels, there is only weak evidence of a relationship between educational attainment and adult mortality.[130]\n\n\nAccording to a paper from 2015, the mortality rate for the Caucasian population in the United States from 1993 to 2001 is four times higher[*dubious – discuss*] for those who did not complete high school compared to those who have at least 16 years of education.[130] In fact, within the U.S. adult population, people with less than a high school education have the shortest life expectancies.\n\n\nPreschool education also plays a large role in life expectancy. It was found that high-quality early-stage childhood education had positive effects on health. Researchers discovered this by analyzing the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, finding that the disadvantaged children who were randomly assigned to treatment had lower instances of risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in their mid-30s.[132]\n\n\n\n## Evolution and aging rate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life history theory\n\nVarious species of plants and animals, including humans, have different lifespans. Evolutionary theory states that organisms which—by virtue of their defenses or lifestyle—live for long periods and avoid accidents, disease, predation, etc. are likely to have genes that code for slow aging, which often translates to good cellular repair. One theory is that if predation or accidental deaths prevent most individuals from living to an old age, there will be less natural selection to increase the intrinsic life span.[133] That finding was supported in a classic study of opossums by Austad;[134] however, the opposite relationship was found in an equally prominent study of guppies by Reznick.[135][136]\n\n\nOne prominent and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction.[137] Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span from a very limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy.[138][139][140] That is the key to why animals like giant tortoises can live so long.[141] Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe ability of skin fibroblasts to perform DNA repair after UV irradiation was measured in shrew, mouse, rat, hamster, cow, elephant and human.[142] It was found that DNA repair capability increased systematically with species life span. Since this original study in 1974, at least 14 additional studies were performed on mammals to test this correlation.[143] In all, but two of these studies, lifespan correlated with DNA repair levels, suggesting that DNA repair capability contributes to life expectancy.[143]\n\n\nIn a broad survey of zoo animals, no relationship was found between investment of the animal in reproduction and its life span.[144]\n\n\n\n## Calculation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Life table § The mathematics\n\n![](image)A survival tree to explain the calculations of life-expectancy.

It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\n\n\nThe starting point for calculating life expectancy is the age-specific death rates of the population members. If a large amount of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years \"exposed to risk\" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to remove (as much as possible) the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used.[147] The most common modern methods include:\n\n\n\n* fitting a mathematical formula (such as the Gompertz function, or an extension of it) to the data.\n* looking at an established mortality table derived from a larger population and making a simple adjustment to it (such as multiplying by a constant factor) to fit the data. (In cases of relatively small amounts of data.)\n* looking at the mortality rates actually experienced at each age and applying a piecewise model (such as by cubic splines) to fit the data. (In cases of relatively large amounts of data.)\n\n\nThe age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, or smokers and non-smokers) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them.[148] The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications (e.g. aircraft), methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.[9]\n\n\nIt is important to note that the life expectancy statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends, but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality, like the Lee–Carter model.[149]\n\n\nAs discussed above, on an individual basis, some factors correlate with longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use (including smoking and alcohol consumption), disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care.[12]\n\n\n\n## Healthy life expectancy[edit]\n\n\nTo assess the quality of these additional years of life, 'healthy life expectancy' has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called **Healthy life expectancy** (**HALE**), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury.[150][151] Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan \"Healthy People 2010\". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.\n\n\n\n![Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries](image)Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries\nThe long-standing quest for longer life led in the 2010s to a more promising focus on increasing HALE, also known as a person's \"healthspan\". Besides the benefits of keeping people healthier longer, a goal is to reduce health-care expenses on the many diseases associated with cellular senescence. Approaches being explored include fasting, exercise, and senolytic drugs.[152]\n\n\n\n## Forecasting[edit]\n\n\nForecasting life expectancy and mortality form an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs (like U.S. Social Security and pension) since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.\n\n\nLife expectancy forecasting is usually based on one of two different approaches:\n\n\n\n1. Forecasting the life expectancy directly, generally using ARIMA or other time-series extrapolation procedures. This has the advantage of simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other life table results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach can be done with any common statistical/mathematical software package, like EViews, R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, or SPSS.\n2. Forecasting age-specific death rates and computing the life expectancy from the results with life table methods. This is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated age-specific mortality rates, but it seems to be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age-specific rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach in this group is the Lee-Carter model,[153] which uses the singular value decomposition on a set of transformed age-specific mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series, and then recovers a full set of age-specific mortality rates from that forecasted value. The software includes Professor Rob J. Hyndman's R package called 'demography' and UC Berkeley's LCFIT system.\n\n\n## Policy uses[edit]\n\n\nLife expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.[154]\n\n\nLife expectancy is used in describing the physical quality of life of an area. It is also used for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy is sold for a cash asset.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nDisparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907).[155] There is a similar relationship among states in the U.S. (r = −0.620).[156]\n\n\n\n## Life expectancy vs. other measures of longevity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Remaining\" life expectancy—expected number of remaining years of life as a function of *current age*—is used in retirement income planning.[49]\nLife expectancy is commonly confused with the average age an adult could expect to live. This confusion may create the expectation that an adult would be unlikely to exceed an life expectancy, even though, with all statistical probability, an adult, who has already avoided many statistical causes of adolescent mortality, should be expected to outlive the life expectancy calculated from birth.[157] One must compare the life expectancy of the period after childhood to estimate also the life expectancy of an adult.[157]\n\n\n  \n\nLife expectancy can change dramatically after childhood. In the table above, note the life expectancy *at birth* in the Paleolithic is 22–33 years, but life expectancy at 15 is 54 years. Additional studies similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.[158][159]\n\n\nMaximum life span is an individual-specific concept, and therefore is an upper bound rather than an average.[157] Science author Christopher Wanjek writes, \"[H]as the human race increased its life span? Not at all. This is one of the biggest misconceptions about old age: we are not living any longer.\" The maximum life span, or oldest age a human can live, may be constant.[157] Further, there are many examples of people living significantly longer than the average life expectancy of their time period, such as Socrates (71), Saint Anthony the Great (105), Michelangelo (88), and John Adams (90).[157]\n\n\nHowever, anthropologist John D. Hawks criticizes the popular conflation of life span (life expectancy) and maximum life span when popular science writers falsely imply that the average adult human does not live longer than their ancestors. He writes, \"[a]ge-specific mortality rates have declined across the adult lifespan. A smaller fraction of adults die at 20, at 30, at 40, at 50, and so on across the lifespan. As a result, we live longer on average... In every way we can measure, human lifespans are longer today than in the immediate past, and longer today than they were 2000 years ago... age-specific mortality rates in adults really have reduced substantially.\"[160]\n\n\nLife expectancy can also create popular misconceptions about at what age a certain population may expect to die at. The modal age at death is the age when most deaths occur in a population, and is sometimes used instead of life expectancy for this kind of understanding. For example, in the table above, life expectancy in the Paleolithic is listed as 22–33 years. For many, this implies that most people in the Paleolithic died in their late twenties. However, in the Paleolithic, most adults in the Paleolithic died at *72 years* (the average modal adult life span).[161]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biodemography\n* Calorie restriction\n* Demography\n* Depreciation\n* DNA damage theory of aging\n* Glasgow effect\n* Health equity\n* Life extension\n* Life table\n* Lindy effect\n* List of countries by life expectancy\n* List of countries by past life expectancy\n* List of longest-living organisms\n* LGBT life expectancy\n* Maximum life span\n* Medieval demography\n* Mitohormesis\n* Mortality rate\n* Population pyramid\n* Senescence\n\n### Increasing life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n* Strategies for engineered negligible senescence (SENS)\n* John Sperling\n* Life extension\n* Longevity\n* Rejuvenation\n* Public health\n* Infant mortality\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In standard actuarial notation, *ex* refers to the expected future lifetime of *(x)* in whole years, while *eͦx* (with a ring above the *e*) denotes the complete expected future lifetime of *(x)*, including the fraction.\n2. **^** Japan's recorded life expectancy may have been very slightly increased by counting many infant deaths as stillborn.[58]\n3. **^**  Note the different units: a probability is unit-less, whereas a mortality rate has units (such as deaths per population per year).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"\"Life Expectancy\" – What does this actually mean?\". *Our World in Data*.

As of 2022[update], Chinese state media reported the country's total fertility rate to be 1.09.[4]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous country from at least 1950 until being surpassed by India in 2023.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of December 2022, China's population stood at 1.4118 billion.[7] According to the 2020 census, 91.11% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.89% were minorities. China's population growth rate is only 0.03%, ranking 159th in the world.[8] China conducted its sixth national population census in 2010,[9][10] and its seventh census was completed in late 2020, with data released in May 2021.[11] Unless otherwise indicated, the statistics on this page pertain to mainland China only; see also Demographics of Hong Kong, Demographics of Macau and Demographics of Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Chinese history\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Under Mao Zedong, China nearly doubled in population from 540 million in 1949 to 969 million in 1979. This growth slowed because of the one-child policy instituted in 1979.[13] The 2022 data shows a declining population for the first time since 1961.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of China from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Age structure projections for China up to 2100\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous nation for many centuries, until being surpassed by India in 2023.[17] When China took its first post-1949 census in 1953, the population stood at 583 million; by the fifth census in 2000, the population had more than doubled, reaching 1.2 billion.\n\n\nBy the sixth census in 2020, the total population had reached to 1,419,933,142, with the mainland having 1,411,778,724, Hong Kong having 7,474,200, and Macau having 683,218. However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Population of China by age and sex (demographic pyramid)[edit]\n\n\n* ![China population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953](image)\n\nChina population

population census since 1964. It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau. Pretests and small scale trial runs were conducted and checked for accuracy between 1980 and 1981 in twenty-four provincial-level units. Census stations were opened in rural production brigades and urban neighborhoods. Beginning on 1 July 1982, each household sent a representative to a census station to be enumerated. The census required about a month to complete and employed approximately 5 million census takers.\n\n\nThe 1982 census collected data in nineteen demographic categories relating to individuals and households. The thirteen areas concerning individuals were name, relationship to head of household, sex, age, nationality, registration status, educational level, profession, occupation, status of nonworking persons, marital status, number of children born and still living, and number of births in 1981. The six items pertaining to households were type (domestic or collective), serial number, number of persons, number of births in 1981, number of deaths in 1981, and number of registered persons absent for more than one year. Information was gathered in a number of important areas for which previous data were either extremely inaccurate or simply nonexistent, including fertility, marital status, urban population, minority ethnic groups, sex composition, age distribution, and employment and unemployment.\n\n\nA fundamental anomaly in the 1982 statistics was noted by some Western analysts. They pointed out that although the birth and death rates recorded by the census and those recorded through the household registration system were different, the two systems arrived at similar population totals. The discrepancies in the vital rates were the result of the underreporting of both births and deaths to the authorities under the registration system; families would not report some births because of the one-child policy and would not report some deaths so as to hold on to the rations of the deceased.\n\n\nNevertheless, the 1982 census was a watershed for both Chinese and world demographics. After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific fertility and mortality rates provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future manpower potential, consumer needs, and utility, energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. Demographers who had been conducting research on global population without accurate data on the Chinese fifth of the world's population were particularly thankful for the 1982 breakthrough census.\n\n\n\n### Population control[edit]\n\n\nSee also: One-child policy and Two-child policy\n\n![](image)Birth rate in China\nInitially, China's post-1949 leaders were ideologically disposed to view a large population as an asset. But the liabilities of a large, rapidly growing population soon became apparent. For one year, starting in August 1956, vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health's mass birth control efforts. These efforts, however, had little impact on fertility. After the interval of the Great Leap Forward, Chinese leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development, and their interest in birth control revived. In the early 1960s, schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign, emphasized the virtues of late marriage. Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial-level governments in 1964. The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities, where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963–66 period. The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution brought the program to a halt, however.\n\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the State Council. Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises. This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population. In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections. In rural areas the country's \"barefoot doctors\" distributed information and contraceptives to people's commune members. By 1973 Mao Zedong was personally identified with the family planning movement, signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before. Yet until several years after Mao's death in 1976, the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved living standards.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPopulation growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families. In the mid-1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country. Since 1979 the government has advocated a one-child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances. As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple, three in special circumstances, and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations. The overall goal of the one-child policy was to keep the total population within 1.2 billion through the year 2000, on the premise that the Four Modernizations program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control.\n\n\nThe one-child policy was a highly ambitious population control program. Like previous programs of the 1960s and 1970s, the one-child policy employed a combination of public education, social pressure, and in some cases coercion. The one-child policy was unique, however, in that it linked reproduction with economic cost or benefit.\n\n\nUnder the one-child program, a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not. Through this policy, the rate of increasing population was tempered after the penalties were made. Couples with only one child were given a \"one-child certificate\" entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer maternity leave, better child care, and preferential housing assignments. In return, they were required to pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole.\n\n\nIn rural areas the day-to-day work of family planning was done by cadres at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women's affairs and by health workers. The women's team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using contraceptives, the methods used, and which had become pregnant. She then reported to the brigade women's leader, who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth-planning committee. According to reports, ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to; to satisfy these cutoffs, unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage, couples without children were advised to \"wait their turn,\" women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions, and those who already had children were urged to use contraception or undergo sterilization. Couples with more than one child were exhorted[*by whom?*] to be sterilized.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe one-child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas. Even without state intervention, there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child. Raising a child required a significant portion of family income, and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen. Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation. In addition, because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement, the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNumerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy. The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force, including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide. Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts, but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only. International reaction to the allegations were mixed. The UN Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation were generally supportive of China's family planning program. The United States Agency for International Development, however, withdrew US$10 million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used.\n\n\nObservers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one-child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years. As of 1987 the one-child program had achieved mixed results. In general, it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results. For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234 million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.[21] Even though China has already opened two-child policy since 2016, data shows that the second-child policy cannot stop the problem of an aging population. China needs to find an appropriate birth policy to optimize the demographic dividend, which refers to the proportion of labor-age population.[22] On the other hand, the higher house prices squeeze the marriage in China. The house price plays an important role on the influence of marriage and fertility. The increasing house price leads to the lower marriage rate and cause the other serious social problems in China. For the rapid reduction of marriage and fertility, the central government should establish the policy to deal with the high house price.[23]\n\n\n\n### Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density in the year 2000\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe–Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China's total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains[*which?*] and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.\n\n\nPopulation is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km2. The Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet autonomous regions and Qinghai and Gansu comprise 55% of the country's land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Area (km2) | Population | Density\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China | 9,650,000 (100%) | 1,411,778,724 (100%) | 134.7/km2 |\n| **5 provinces** | 5,246,400 (54.45%) | 84,493,388 (5.98%) | 15.16/km2 |\n|  | Inner Mongolia | 1,183,000 (12.28% ) | 24,049,155 (1.70%) | 20.33/km2 |\n| Xinjiang | 1,660,000 (17.23%) | 25,852,345 (1.83%) | 12.62/km2 |\n| Tibet | 1,228,400 (12.75%) | 3,648,100 (0.26%) | 2.31/km2 |\n| Qinghai | 721,000 (7.48%) | 5,923,957 (0.42%) | 7.65/km2 |\n| Gansu | 454,000 (4.71%) | 25,019,831 (1.77%) | 57.65/km2 |\n| **Other provinces** | 4,403,605 (45.55%) | 1,327,285,336 (94.02%) | 277.27/km2 |\n| Source: National Bureau of Statistics |\n\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China population changes 1949 - 2022\n### Table of births and deaths 1949–2022[edit]\n\n\nChina's fertility statistics differ depending on the source.

Beginning in the early 1950s, mortality steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China's population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the United States Bureau of the Census. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the Great Leap Forward (1958–60).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Chinese government statistics, the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982. It remained stable from 1949 to 1954, varied widely from 1955 to 1965, experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969, dropped sharply in the late 1970s, and increased from 1980 to 1981. Between 1970 and 1980, the crude birth rate dropped from 33.4 per 1,000 to 18.2 per 1,000. The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the *wǎn xī shǎo* (\"晚、稀、少\", or \"late, long, few\": later marriages, longer intervals between births, and fewer children) birth control campaign. However, elements of socioeconomic change, such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced infant mortality (a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children), may have played some role. The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1,000, primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births. The rise was an indication of problems with the one-child policy of 1979. Chinese sources, however, indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1,000 in recent years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn urban areas, the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate. Also, the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates (see Cultural Revolution (1966–76)). Primarily for economic reasons, rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates. The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old-age welfare system were incentives for rural people to produce many children, especially sons, for help in the fields and for support in old age. Because of these conditions, it is unclear to what degree education had been able to erode traditional values favoring large families.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nChina exhibits a serious gender imbalance. Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls, and among China's \"floating population\" the ratio was as high as 128:100. These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses. It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025–2030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.[28]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the National Health Commission reported 9.56 million births, the lowest figure on record since 1949.[29]\n\n\n\n### Total fertility rate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the TFR was 1.22 (0.86 for cities, 1.08 for towns and 1.43 for villages/outposts). Beijing had the lowest TFR at 0.67, while Guizhou had the highest at 2.19. The Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city (Heilongjiang) has a TFR of 0.41, which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history. Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the Heping district of Tianjin city (Tianjin), and 0.46 in the Mawei district of Fuzhou city (Fujian). At the other end TFR was 3.96 in Geji County (Tibet), 4.07 in Jiali County (Tibet), and 5.47 in Baqing County (Tibet).[30]\n\n\nThe 2010 census reported a TFR of 1.18 (0.88 in cities, 1.15 in townships, and\n1.44 in rural areas).[31]\nThe five regions with the lowest fertility rates were Beijing (0.71), Shanghai\n(0.74), Liaoning (0.74), Heilongjiang (0.75), and Jilin (0.76). The five regions with the highest\nfertility rates were Guangxi (1.79), Guizhou (1.75), Xinjiang (1.53), Hainan (1.51), and Anhui\n(1.48).[31]\n\n\nTotal fertility rate by ethnic group (2010 census): Han (1.14), Zhuang (1.59), Hui (1.48), Manchu (1.18), Uyghur (2.04), Miao (1.82), Yi (1.82), Tujia (1.74), Tibetan (1.60), Mongols (1.26).[32]\n\n\nIn 2022, the TFR was 1.09.[4]\n\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the number of people theoretically able to enter the Chinese labor force (individuals aged 15 to 59), shrank slightly to 937.27 million, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from a demographic transition, is anticipated to continue until at least 2030.[33]\nThe World Factbook estimated the 2019 active labor force was 774.71 million.[34]\n\n\n\n### Height and weight[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the average Chinese man was 169.7 centimeters tall (5 ft 7 in) in 2019, the figures showed, and women's average height was 158 centimeters (5 ft 2.2 in). The same study showed an average Chinese man weighed 69.6 kilograms (153.4 lbs, or 11 stone 0 lbs), up 3.4 kilograms (7.5 lbs) over 10 years, while women were 1.7 kilograms (3.8 pounds) heavier on average at 59 kilograms (130.1 pounds, or 9 stone 4.1 lbs). They were up 1.2 centimeters (0.47  in) and 0.8 centimeters (0.31 in) respectively from 5 years earlier.[35]\n\n\n\n### Gender balance[edit]\n\n\nFuture challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2020 census, males account for 51.24% of China's 1.41 billion people, while females made up 48.76% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005.[36] In most Western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls (51.22%).\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of ethnic groups in China.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, the largest of which are Han, who constitute 91.51% of the total population in 2010. Ethnic minorities constitute 8.49% or 113.8 million of China's population in 2010. During the past decades ethnic minorities have experienced higher growth rates than the majority Han population, because they are not under the one-child policy. Their proportion of the population in China has grown from 6.1% in 1953, to 8.04% in 1990, 8.41% in 2000, and 8.49% in 2010. Large ethnic minorities (data according to the 2000 census) include the Zhuang (16 million, 1.28%), Manchu (10 million, 0.84%), Uyghur (9 million, 0.78%), Hui (9 million, 0.71%), Miao (8 million, 0.71%), Yi (7 million, 0.61%), Tujia (5.75 million, 0.63%), Mongols (5 million, 0.46%), Tibetan (5 million, 0.43%), Buyei (3 million, 0.23%), and Korean (2 million, 0.15%). Over 126,000 Westerners from Canada, the US and Europe are living in Mainland China.[37] Almost 1% of people living in Hong Kong are Westerners.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of China according to ethnic

Migration in China and Chinese emigration\n\nInternal migration in the People's Republic of China is one of the most extensive in the world according to the International Labour Organization.[67] In fact, research done by Kam Wing Chan of the University of Washington suggests that \"In the 30 years since 1979, China's urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622 million in 2009. Of the 440 million increase, about 340 million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification. Even if only half of that increase was migration, the volume of rural-urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history.\"[68] Migrants in China are commonly members of a floating population, which refers primarily to migrants in China without local household registration status through the Chinese Hukou system.[69] In general, rural-urban migrant workers are most excluded from local educational resources, citywide social welfare programs and many jobs because of their lack of hukou status.[70]\n\n\nIn 2011 a total of 252.78 million migrant workers (an increase of 4.4% compared to 2010) existed in China. Out of these, migrant workers who left their hometown and worked in other provinces accounted for 158.63 million (an increase of 3.4% compared to 2010) and migrant workers who worked within their home provinces reached 94.15 million (an increase of 5.9% compared to 2010).[71] Estimations are that Chinese cities will face an influx of another 243 million migrants by 2025, taking the urban population up to nearly 1 billion people.[72] This population of migrants would represent \"almost 40 percent of the total urban population,\" a number which is almost three times the current level.[72][73] While it is often difficult to collect accurate statistical data on migrant floating populations, the number of migrants is undoubtedly quite large. \"In China's largest cities, for instance, it is often quoted that at least one out of every five persons is a migrant.\"[74] China's government influences the pattern of urbanization through the Hukou permanent residence registration system, land-sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials. The other factors influencing migration of people from rural provincial areas to large cities are employment, education, business opportunities and higher standard of living.[75]\n\n\nThe mass emigration known as the Chinese diaspora,[76] which occurred from the 19th century to 1949, was mainly caused by wars and starvation in mainland China, invasion from various foreign countries, as well as the problems resulting from political corruption. Most immigrants were illiterate peasants and manual labourers, called \"coolies\" by analogy to the same pattern of immigration from India, who emigrated to work in countries such as the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## Urbanization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban construction work in Guangshui, 2013\nMain article: Urbanization in China\n\nUrbanization increased in speed following the initiation of the reform and opening policy. By the end of 2014, 54.7% of the total population lived in urban areas, a rate that rose from 26% in 1990.[77]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[78]\nNo statistics have been included for areas currently governed by the Republic of China (Taiwan).

It is worthwhile to note that this does not include other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of national ancestral gods or the gods of nature (which in northern China is more common than ancestor worship), and Taoism and Confucianism.\n2. **^** Historical record and contemporary scholarly fieldwork testify certain central and northern provinces of China as hotbeds of folk religious sects and Confucian religious groups.\n3. **^** The map represents the geographic diffusion of the tradition of folk religious movements of salvation, Confucian churches and *jiaohua* (\"transformative teachings\") movements, based on historical data and contemporary fieldwork. Due to incomplete data and ambiguous identity of many of these traditions the map may not be completely accurate. Sources include a *World Religion Map* from Harvard University, based on data from the World Religion Database, showing highly unprecise ranges of Chinese folk (salvationist) religions' membership by province. Another source, the studies of China's Regional Religious System, find \"very high activity of popular religion and secret societies and low Buddhist presence in northern regions, while very high Buddhist presence in the southeast\".[44]\n[note 2]\n\n\t* Hebei: Fieldwork by Thomas David Dubois[45] testifies the dominance of folk religious movements, specifically the Church of the Heaven and the Earth and the Church of the Highest Supreme, since their \"energetic revival since the 1970s\" (p. 13), in the religious life of the counties of Hebei. Religious life in rural Hebei is also characterised by a type of organisation called the benevolent churches and the salvationist movement known as Zailiism has returned active since the 1990s.\n\t* Henan: According to Heberer and Jakobi (2000)[46] Henan has been for centuries a hub of folk religious sects (p. 7) that constitute significant focuses of the religious life of the province. Sects present in the region include the Baguadao or Tianli (\"Order of Heaven\") sect, the Dadaohui, the Tianxianmiaodao, the Yiguandao, and many others. Henan also has a strong popular Confucian orientation (p. 5).\n\t* Northeast China: According to official records by the then-government, the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue or Morality Society had 8 million members in Manchuria, or northeast China in the 1930s, making up about 25% of the total population of the area (note that the state of Manchuria also included the eastern end of modern-day Inner Mongolia).[47] Folk religious movements of a Confucian nature, or Confucian churches, were in fact very successful in the northeast.\n\t* Shandong: The province is traditionally a stronghold of Confucianism and is the area of origin of many folk religious sects and Confucian churches of the modern period, including the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, the Way of the Return to the One (皈依道 *Guīyīdào*), the Way of Unity (一貫道 *Yīguàndào*), and others. Alex Payette (2016) testifies the rapid growth of Confucian groups in the province in the 2010s.[48]\n\nAccording to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2012,[49] about 2.2% of the total population of China (around 30 million people) claims membership in the folk religious sects, which have likely maintained their historical dominance in central-northern and northeastern China.\n4. **^** The statistics for Chinese ancestorism, that is the worship of ancestor-gods within the lineage system, are from the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey of 2010.[43] The statistics for Buddhism and Christianity are from the China Family Panel Studies survey of 2012.[51] The statistics for Islam are from a survey conducted in 2010.[52] It is worthwhile to note that the populations of Chinese ancestorism and Buddhism may overlap, even with the large remaining parts of the population whose belief is not documented in the table. The latter, the uncharted population, may practise other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of gods, Taoism, Confucianism and folk salvationisms, or may be atheist. Indeed, according to the CFPS 2012, only 6.3% of the Chinese were irreligious in the sense of \"atheism\", while the rest practised the worship of gods and ancestors.[53]: 13\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Country Comparisons - Infant mortality rate\". *The World Factbook*.

As of 2022[update], Chinese state media reported the country's total fertility rate to be 1.09.[4]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous country from at least 1950 until being surpassed by India in 2023.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of December 2022, China's population stood at 1.4118 billion.[7] According to the 2020 census, 91.11% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.89% were minorities. China's population growth rate is only 0.03%, ranking 159th in the world.[8] China conducted its sixth national population census in 2010,[9][10] and its seventh census was completed in late 2020, with data released in May 2021.[11] Unless otherwise indicated, the statistics on this page pertain to mainland China only; see also Demographics of Hong Kong, Demographics of Macau and Demographics of Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Chinese history\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Under Mao Zedong, China nearly doubled in population from 540 million in 1949 to 969 million in 1979. This growth slowed because of the one-child policy instituted in 1979.[13] The 2022 data shows a declining population for the first time since 1961.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of China from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Age structure projections for China up to 2100\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous nation for many centuries, until being surpassed by India in 2023.[17] When China took its first post-1949 census in 1953, the population stood at 583 million; by the fifth census in 2000, the population had more than doubled, reaching 1.2 billion.\n\n\nBy the sixth census in 2020, the total population had reached to 1,419,933,142, with the mainland having 1,411,778,724, Hong Kong having 7,474,200, and Macau having 683,218. However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Population of China by age and sex (demographic pyramid)[edit]\n\n\n* ![China population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953](image)\n\nChina population

population census since 1964. It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau. Pretests and small scale trial runs were conducted and checked for accuracy between 1980 and 1981 in twenty-four provincial-level units. Census stations were opened in rural production brigades and urban neighborhoods. Beginning on 1 July 1982, each household sent a representative to a census station to be enumerated. The census required about a month to complete and employed approximately 5 million census takers.\n\n\nThe 1982 census collected data in nineteen demographic categories relating to individuals and households. The thirteen areas concerning individuals were name, relationship to head of household, sex, age, nationality, registration status, educational level, profession, occupation, status of nonworking persons, marital status, number of children born and still living, and number of births in 1981. The six items pertaining to households were type (domestic or collective), serial number, number of persons, number of births in 1981, number of deaths in 1981, and number of registered persons absent for more than one year. Information was gathered in a number of important areas for which previous data were either extremely inaccurate or simply nonexistent, including fertility, marital status, urban population, minority ethnic groups, sex composition, age distribution, and employment and unemployment.\n\n\nA fundamental anomaly in the 1982 statistics was noted by some Western analysts. They pointed out that although the birth and death rates recorded by the census and those recorded through the household registration system were different, the two systems arrived at similar population totals. The discrepancies in the vital rates were the result of the underreporting of both births and deaths to the authorities under the registration system; families would not report some births because of the one-child policy and would not report some deaths so as to hold on to the rations of the deceased.\n\n\nNevertheless, the 1982 census was a watershed for both Chinese and world demographics. After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific fertility and mortality rates provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future manpower potential, consumer needs, and utility, energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. Demographers who had been conducting research on global population without accurate data on the Chinese fifth of the world's population were particularly thankful for the 1982 breakthrough census.\n\n\n\n### Population control[edit]\n\n\nSee also: One-child policy and Two-child policy\n\n![](image)Birth rate in China\nInitially, China's post-1949 leaders were ideologically disposed to view a large population as an asset. But the liabilities of a large, rapidly growing population soon became apparent. For one year, starting in August 1956, vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health's mass birth control efforts. These efforts, however, had little impact on fertility. After the interval of the Great Leap Forward, Chinese leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development, and their interest in birth control revived. In the early 1960s, schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign, emphasized the virtues of late marriage. Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial-level governments in 1964. The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities, where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963–66 period. The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution brought the program to a halt, however.\n\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the State Council. Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises. This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population. In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections. In rural areas the country's \"barefoot doctors\" distributed information and contraceptives to people's commune members. By 1973 Mao Zedong was personally identified with the family planning movement, signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before. Yet until several years after Mao's death in 1976, the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved living standards.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPopulation growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families. In the mid-1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country. Since 1979 the government has advocated a one-child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances. As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple, three in special circumstances, and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations. The overall goal of the one-child policy was to keep the total population within 1.2 billion through the year 2000, on the premise that the Four Modernizations program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control.\n\n\nThe one-child policy was a highly ambitious population control program. Like previous programs of the 1960s and 1970s, the one-child policy employed a combination of public education, social pressure, and in some cases coercion. The one-child policy was unique, however, in that it linked reproduction with economic cost or benefit.\n\n\nUnder the one-child program, a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not. Through this policy, the rate of increasing population was tempered after the penalties were made. Couples with only one child were given a \"one-child certificate\" entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer maternity leave, better child care, and preferential housing assignments. In return, they were required to pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole.\n\n\nIn rural areas the day-to-day work of family planning was done by cadres at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women's affairs and by health workers. The women's team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using contraceptives, the methods used, and which had become pregnant. She then reported to the brigade women's leader, who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth-planning committee. According to reports, ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to; to satisfy these cutoffs, unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage, couples without children were advised to \"wait their turn,\" women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions, and those who already had children were urged to use contraception or undergo sterilization. Couples with more than one child were exhorted[*by whom?*] to be sterilized.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe one-child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas. Even without state intervention, there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child. Raising a child required a significant portion of family income, and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen. Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation. In addition, because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement, the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNumerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy. The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force, including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide. Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts, but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only. International reaction to the allegations were mixed. The UN Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation were generally supportive of China's family planning program. The United States Agency for International Development, however, withdrew US$10 million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used.\n\n\nObservers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one-child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years. As of 1987 the one-child program had achieved mixed results. In general, it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results. For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234 million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.[21] Even though China has already opened two-child policy since 2016, data shows that the second-child policy cannot stop the problem of an aging population. China needs to find an appropriate birth policy to optimize the demographic dividend, which refers to the proportion of labor-age population.[22] On the other hand, the higher house prices squeeze the marriage in China. The house price plays an important role on the influence of marriage and fertility. The increasing house price leads to the lower marriage rate and cause the other serious social problems in China. For the rapid reduction of marriage and fertility, the central government should establish the policy to deal with the high house price.[23]\n\n\n\n### Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density in the year 2000\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe–Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China's total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains[*which?*] and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.\n\n\nPopulation is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km2. The Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet autonomous regions and Qinghai and Gansu comprise 55% of the country's land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Area (km2) | Population | Density\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China | 9,650,000 (100%) | 1,411,778,724 (100%) | 134.7/km2 |\n| **5 provinces** | 5,246,400 (54.45%) | 84,493,388 (5.98%) | 15.16/km2 |\n|  | Inner Mongolia | 1,183,000 (12.28% ) | 24,049,155 (1.70%) | 20.33/km2 |\n| Xinjiang | 1,660,000 (17.23%) | 25,852,345 (1.83%) | 12.62/km2 |\n| Tibet | 1,228,400 (12.75%) | 3,648,100 (0.26%) | 2.31/km2 |\n| Qinghai | 721,000 (7.48%) | 5,923,957 (0.42%) | 7.65/km2 |\n| Gansu | 454,000 (4.71%) | 25,019,831 (1.77%) | 57.65/km2 |\n| **Other provinces** | 4,403,605 (45.55%) | 1,327,285,336 (94.02%) | 277.27/km2 |\n| Source: National Bureau of Statistics |\n\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China population changes 1949 - 2022\n### Table of births and deaths 1949–2022[edit]\n\n\nChina's fertility statistics differ depending on the source.

Beginning in the early 1950s, mortality steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China's population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the United States Bureau of the Census. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the Great Leap Forward (1958–60).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Chinese government statistics, the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982. It remained stable from 1949 to 1954, varied widely from 1955 to 1965, experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969, dropped sharply in the late 1970s, and increased from 1980 to 1981. Between 1970 and 1980, the crude birth rate dropped from 33.4 per 1,000 to 18.2 per 1,000. The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the *wǎn xī shǎo* (\"晚、稀、少\", or \"late, long, few\": later marriages, longer intervals between births, and fewer children) birth control campaign. However, elements of socioeconomic change, such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced infant mortality (a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children), may have played some role. The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1,000, primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births. The rise was an indication of problems with the one-child policy of 1979. Chinese sources, however, indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1,000 in recent years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn urban areas, the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate. Also, the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates (see Cultural Revolution (1966–76)). Primarily for economic reasons, rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates. The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old-age welfare system were incentives for rural people to produce many children, especially sons, for help in the fields and for support in old age. Because of these conditions, it is unclear to what degree education had been able to erode traditional values favoring large families.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nChina exhibits a serious gender imbalance. Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls, and among China's \"floating population\" the ratio was as high as 128:100. These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses. It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025–2030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.[28]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the National Health Commission reported 9.56 million births, the lowest figure on record since 1949.[29]\n\n\n\n### Total fertility rate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the TFR was 1.22 (0.86 for cities, 1.08 for towns and 1.43 for villages/outposts). Beijing had the lowest TFR at 0.67, while Guizhou had the highest at 2.19. The Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city (Heilongjiang) has a TFR of 0.41, which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history. Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the Heping district of Tianjin city (Tianjin), and 0.46 in the Mawei district of Fuzhou city (Fujian). At the other end TFR was 3.96 in Geji County (Tibet), 4.07 in Jiali County (Tibet), and 5.47 in Baqing County (Tibet).[30]\n\n\nThe 2010 census reported a TFR of 1.18 (0.88 in cities, 1.15 in townships, and\n1.44 in rural areas).[31]\nThe five regions with the lowest fertility rates were Beijing (0.71), Shanghai\n(0.74), Liaoning (0.74), Heilongjiang (0.75), and Jilin (0.76). The five regions with the highest\nfertility rates were Guangxi (1.79), Guizhou (1.75), Xinjiang (1.53), Hainan (1.51), and Anhui\n(1.48).[31]\n\n\nTotal fertility rate by ethnic group (2010 census): Han (1.14), Zhuang (1.59), Hui (1.48), Manchu (1.18), Uyghur (2.04), Miao (1.82), Yi (1.82), Tujia (1.74), Tibetan (1.60), Mongols (1.26).[32]\n\n\nIn 2022, the TFR was 1.09.[4]\n\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the number of people theoretically able to enter the Chinese labor force (individuals aged 15 to 59), shrank slightly to 937.27 million, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from a demographic transition, is anticipated to continue until at least 2030.[33]\nThe World Factbook estimated the 2019 active labor force was 774.71 million.[34]\n\n\n\n### Height and weight[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the average Chinese man was 169.7 centimeters tall (5 ft 7 in) in 2019, the figures showed, and women's average height was 158 centimeters (5 ft 2.2 in). The same study showed an average Chinese man weighed 69.6 kilograms (153.4 lbs, or 11 stone 0 lbs), up 3.4 kilograms (7.5 lbs) over 10 years, while women were 1.7 kilograms (3.8 pounds) heavier on average at 59 kilograms (130.1 pounds, or 9 stone 4.1 lbs). They were up 1.2 centimeters (0.47  in) and 0.8 centimeters (0.31 in) respectively from 5 years earlier.[35]\n\n\n\n### Gender balance[edit]\n\n\nFuture challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2020 census, males account for 51.24% of China's 1.41 billion people, while females made up 48.76% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005.[36] In most Western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls (51.22%).\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of ethnic groups in China.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, the largest of which are Han, who constitute 91.51% of the total population in 2010. Ethnic minorities constitute 8.49% or 113.8 million of China's population in 2010. During the past decades ethnic minorities have experienced higher growth rates than the majority Han population, because they are not under the one-child policy. Their proportion of the population in China has grown from 6.1% in 1953, to 8.04% in 1990, 8.41% in 2000, and 8.49% in 2010. Large ethnic minorities (data according to the 2000 census) include the Zhuang (16 million, 1.28%), Manchu (10 million, 0.84%), Uyghur (9 million, 0.78%), Hui (9 million, 0.71%), Miao (8 million, 0.71%), Yi (7 million, 0.61%), Tujia (5.75 million, 0.63%), Mongols (5 million, 0.46%), Tibetan (5 million, 0.43%), Buyei (3 million, 0.23%), and Korean (2 million, 0.15%). Over 126,000 Westerners from Canada, the US and Europe are living in Mainland China.[37] Almost 1% of people living in Hong Kong are Westerners.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of China according to ethnic

Migration in China and Chinese emigration\n\nInternal migration in the People's Republic of China is one of the most extensive in the world according to the International Labour Organization.[67] In fact, research done by Kam Wing Chan of the University of Washington suggests that \"In the 30 years since 1979, China's urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622 million in 2009. Of the 440 million increase, about 340 million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification. Even if only half of that increase was migration, the volume of rural-urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history.\"[68] Migrants in China are commonly members of a floating population, which refers primarily to migrants in China without local household registration status through the Chinese Hukou system.[69] In general, rural-urban migrant workers are most excluded from local educational resources, citywide social welfare programs and many jobs because of their lack of hukou status.[70]\n\n\nIn 2011 a total of 252.78 million migrant workers (an increase of 4.4% compared to 2010) existed in China. Out of these, migrant workers who left their hometown and worked in other provinces accounted for 158.63 million (an increase of 3.4% compared to 2010) and migrant workers who worked within their home provinces reached 94.15 million (an increase of 5.9% compared to 2010).[71] Estimations are that Chinese cities will face an influx of another 243 million migrants by 2025, taking the urban population up to nearly 1 billion people.[72] This population of migrants would represent \"almost 40 percent of the total urban population,\" a number which is almost three times the current level.[72][73] While it is often difficult to collect accurate statistical data on migrant floating populations, the number of migrants is undoubtedly quite large. \"In China's largest cities, for instance, it is often quoted that at least one out of every five persons is a migrant.\"[74] China's government influences the pattern of urbanization through the Hukou permanent residence registration system, land-sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials. The other factors influencing migration of people from rural provincial areas to large cities are employment, education, business opportunities and higher standard of living.[75]\n\n\nThe mass emigration known as the Chinese diaspora,[76] which occurred from the 19th century to 1949, was mainly caused by wars and starvation in mainland China, invasion from various foreign countries, as well as the problems resulting from political corruption. Most immigrants were illiterate peasants and manual labourers, called \"coolies\" by analogy to the same pattern of immigration from India, who emigrated to work in countries such as the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## Urbanization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban construction work in Guangshui, 2013\nMain article: Urbanization in China\n\nUrbanization increased in speed following the initiation of the reform and opening policy. By the end of 2014, 54.7% of the total population lived in urban areas, a rate that rose from 26% in 1990.[77]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[78]\nNo statistics have been included for areas currently governed by the Republic of China (Taiwan).

It is worthwhile to note that this does not include other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of national ancestral gods or the gods of nature (which in northern China is more common than ancestor worship), and Taoism and Confucianism.\n2. **^** Historical record and contemporary scholarly fieldwork testify certain central and northern provinces of China as hotbeds of folk religious sects and Confucian religious groups.\n3. **^** The map represents the geographic diffusion of the tradition of folk religious movements of salvation, Confucian churches and *jiaohua* (\"transformative teachings\") movements, based on historical data and contemporary fieldwork. Due to incomplete data and ambiguous identity of many of these traditions the map may not be completely accurate. Sources include a *World Religion Map* from Harvard University, based on data from the World Religion Database, showing highly unprecise ranges of Chinese folk (salvationist) religions' membership by province. Another source, the studies of China's Regional Religious System, find \"very high activity of popular religion and secret societies and low Buddhist presence in northern regions, while very high Buddhist presence in the southeast\".[44]\n[note 2]\n\n\t* Hebei: Fieldwork by Thomas David Dubois[45] testifies the dominance of folk religious movements, specifically the Church of the Heaven and the Earth and the Church of the Highest Supreme, since their \"energetic revival since the 1970s\" (p. 13), in the religious life of the counties of Hebei. Religious life in rural Hebei is also characterised by a type of organisation called the benevolent churches and the salvationist movement known as Zailiism has returned active since the 1990s.\n\t* Henan: According to Heberer and Jakobi (2000)[46] Henan has been for centuries a hub of folk religious sects (p. 7) that constitute significant focuses of the religious life of the province. Sects present in the region include the Baguadao or Tianli (\"Order of Heaven\") sect, the Dadaohui, the Tianxianmiaodao, the Yiguandao, and many others. Henan also has a strong popular Confucian orientation (p. 5).\n\t* Northeast China: According to official records by the then-government, the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue or Morality Society had 8 million members in Manchuria, or northeast China in the 1930s, making up about 25% of the total population of the area (note that the state of Manchuria also included the eastern end of modern-day Inner Mongolia).[47] Folk religious movements of a Confucian nature, or Confucian churches, were in fact very successful in the northeast.\n\t* Shandong: The province is traditionally a stronghold of Confucianism and is the area of origin of many folk religious sects and Confucian churches of the modern period, including the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, the Way of the Return to the One (皈依道 *Guīyīdào*), the Way of Unity (一貫道 *Yīguàndào*), and others. Alex Payette (2016) testifies the rapid growth of Confucian groups in the province in the 2010s.[48]\n\nAccording to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2012,[49] about 2.2% of the total population of China (around 30 million people) claims membership in the folk religious sects, which have likely maintained their historical dominance in central-northern and northeastern China.\n4. **^** The statistics for Chinese ancestorism, that is the worship of ancestor-gods within the lineage system, are from the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey of 2010.[43] The statistics for Buddhism and Christianity are from the China Family Panel Studies survey of 2012.[51] The statistics for Islam are from a survey conducted in 2010.[52] It is worthwhile to note that the populations of Chinese ancestorism and Buddhism may overlap, even with the large remaining parts of the population whose belief is not documented in the table. The latter, the uncharted population, may practise other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of gods, Taoism, Confucianism and folk salvationisms, or may be atheist. Indeed, according to the CFPS 2012, only 6.3% of the Chinese were irreligious in the sense of \"atheism\", while the rest practised the worship of gods and ancestors.[53]: 13\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Country Comparisons - Infant mortality rate\". *The World Factbook*.

India overtook China to become the most populous country at the end of April 2023.[7] As of the UN data released in April 2023,[8] India has surpassed China to become the world's most populous nation. According to the UN's World Population dashboard, India's population now stands at slightly over 1.428 billion, edging past China's population of 1.425 billion people, as reported by the news agency Bloomberg.[9] its population is set to reach 1.7 billion by 2050.[10][11] In 2017 its population growth rate was 0.98%, ranking 112th in the world; in contrast, from 1972 to 1983, India's population grew by an annual rate of 2.3%.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, the median age of an Indian was 28.7 years,[13] compared to 38.4 for China and 48.6 for Japan; and, by 2030; India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4.[14] However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[15]\n\n\nIndia has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[16] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates: the Nihali language,[17] spoken in parts of Maharashtra, and the Burushaski language, spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. 1,000,000 people in India are Anglo-Indians and 700,000 United States citizens are living in India.[18] They represent over 0.1% of the total population of India. Overall, only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.[19]\n\n\nThe sex ratio was 944 females for 1000 males in 2016, and 940 per 1000 in 2011.[20] This ratio has been showing an upwards trend for the last two decades after a continuous decline in the 20th century.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economic history of India\n\n![](image)Historical population of India and China since 1100 with projection to 2100\n### Prehistory to early 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Estimates of historical world population\n\nThe following table lists estimates for the population of India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) from prehistory up until 1820.

population grew from the South Asian Stone Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate,[32] before population growth slowed down in the classical era up to 500 AD, and then became largely stagnant during the early medieval era era up to 1000 AD.[24][26] The population growth rate then increased in the late medieval era (during the Delhi Sultanate) from 1000 to 1500.[24][26]\n\n\nUnder the Mughal Empire, India experienced a high economic and demographic upsurge,[32] due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production.[33] 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India[34] and contemporary Europe[34] up until the 19th century.[35] These estimates by Abraham Eraly[34] and Paolo Malanima[35] have been criticised by Tim Dyson, who considers them exaggerations and estimates urbanisation of the Mughal Empire to be less than 9% of the population.[36]\n\n\nUnder the reign of Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe.[37] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[38] Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551–1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.[34] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[34] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people[39] and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people.[40] Mughal India also had a large number of villages, with 455,698 villages by the time of Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707).[37]\n\n\n\n### Late 19th century to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman.

Suggestions that it was the benefits of colonialism are refuted by academic thinking: \"There can be no serious, informed belief… that… late colonial era mortality diminished and population grew rapidly because of improvements in income, living standards, nutrition, environmental standards, sanitation or health policies, nor was there a cultural transformation…\".[47]\n\n\n\n## Salient features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crude birth rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 people, national average)[48][49][50]\n![](image)Infant mortality rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 births, under age 1, national average)\nIndia occupies 2.41% of the world's land area but supports over 18% of the world's population. At the 2001 census 72.2% of the population[51] lived in about 638,000 villages[52] and the remaining 27.8%[51] lived in more than 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations.[53]\n\n\nIndia's population exceeded that of the entire continent of Africa by 200 million people in 2010.[54] However, because Africa's population growth is nearly double that of India, it is expected to surpass both China and India by 2025.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Comparative demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nComparative demographics\n| Category\n | Global ranking\n | References\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Area\n

Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that a birth sex ratio between 1.08 and 1.12 can be due to natural factors, such as the age of mother at the baby's birth, the age of father at conception, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, and others.[79] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to birth sex ratios (870–930 girls to 1000 boys) observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 and 2005. They are also similar to birth sex ratios (below 900 girls to 1000 boys) observed in mothers of different age groups and gestation periods in the United States.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Population within

ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[122][123] 700,000 people from the United States of any race live in India.[18] Between 300,000 and 1 million Anglo-Indians live in India.[124]\n\n\nFor a list of ethnic groups in the Republic of India (as well as neighbouring countries) see South Asian ethnic groups.\n\n\n\nLinguistic groups in India chart[125][126]\n\n\n\nIndo-Aryan (75%)\nDravidian (20%)\nKolarian, Tibeto-Burman, Khasi, Tai and others (5%)\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia\n\n### Y-chromosome DNA[edit]\n\n\n[127]\n\n\nY-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, The Indian Y-chromosome pool may be summarised as follows where haplogroups R-M420, H, R2, L and NOP comprise generally more than 80% of the total chromosomes.[128]\n\n\n\n* H ~ 30%\n* R1a ~ 34%\n* R2 ~ 15%\n* L ~ 10%\n* NOP ~ 10% (Excluding R)\n* Other Haplogroups 15%\n\n\n### Mitochondrial DNA[edit]\n\n\n[129]\n\n\nMitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage. The Indian mitochondrial DNA is primarily made up of Haplogroup M[130]\n\n\n\n* Haplogroup M ~ 60%\n* Haplogroup UK ~ 15%\n* Haplogroup N ~ 25% (Excluding UK)\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tripuri children preparing for a dance performance. The Tripuris are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.\nNumerous genomic studies have been conducted in the last 15 years to seek insights into India's demographic and cultural diversity. These studies paint a complex and conflicting picture.\n\n\n\n* In a 2003 study, Basu, Majumder *et al*. have concluded on the basis of results obtained from mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal markers that \"(1) there is an underlying unity of female lineages in India, indicating that the initial number of female settlers may have been small; (2) the tribal and the caste populations are highly differentiated; (3) the Austroasiatic tribals are the earliest settlers in India, providing support to one anthropological hypothesis while refuting some others; (4) a major wave of humans entered India through the northeast; (5) the Tibeto-Burman tribals share considerable genetic commonalities with the Austroasiatic tribals, supporting the hypothesis that they may have shared a common habitat in southern China, but the two groups of tribals can be differentiated on the basis of Y-chromosomal haplotypes; (6) the Dravidian speaking populations were possibly widespread throughout India but are regulated to South India now; (7) formation of populations by fission that resulted in founder and drift effects have left their imprints on the genetic structures of contemporary populations; (8) the upper castes show closer genetic affinities with Central Asian populations, although those of southern India are more distant than those of northern India; (9) historical gene flow into India has contributed to a considerable obliteration of genetic histories of contemporary populations so that there is at present no clear congruence of genetic and geographical or sociocultural affinities.\"[131]\n* In a later 2010 review article, Majumder affirms some of these conclusions, introduces and revises some other. The ongoing studies, concludes Majumder, suggest India has served as the major early corridor for geographical dispersal of modern humans from out-of-Africa. The archaeological and genetic traces of the earliest settlers in India has not provided any conclusive evidence. The tribal populations of India are older than the non-tribal populations. The autosomal differentiation and genetic diversity within India's caste populations at 0.04 is significantly lower than 0.14 for continental populations and 0.09 for 31 world population sets studied by Watkins *et al*., suggesting that while tribal populations were differentiated, the differentiation effects within India's caste population was less than previously thought. Majumder also concludes that recent studies suggest India has been a major contributor to the gene pool of southeast Asia.[132][133]\n* Another study covering a large sample of Indian populations allowed Watkins *et al*. to examine eight Indian caste groups and four endogamous south Indian tribal populations. The Indian castes data show low between-group differences, while the tribal Indian groups show relatively high between-group differentiation. This suggests that people between Indian castes were not reproductively isolated, while Indian tribal populations experienced reproductive isolation and drift. Furthermore, the genetic fixation index data show historical genetic differentiation and segregation between Indian castes population is much smaller than those found in east Asia, Africa and other continental populations; while being similar to the genetic differentiation and segregation observed in European populations.[133]\n* In 2006, Sahoo *et al*. reported their analysis of genomic data on 936 Y-chromosomes representing 32 tribal and 45 caste groups from different regions of India. These scientists find that the haplogroup frequency distribution across the country, between different caste groups, was found to be predominantly driven by geographical, rather than cultural determinants. They conclude there is clear evidence for both large-scale immigration into ancient India of Sino-Tibetan speakers and language change of former Austroasiatic speakers, in the northeast Indian region.[134][135]\n* The genome studies conducted up until 2010 have been on relatively small population sets. Many are from just one southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana, which was part of the state until June 2014). Thus, any conclusions on demographic history of India must be interpreted with caution. A larger national genome study with demographic growth and sex ratio balances may offer further insights on the extent of genetic differentiation and segregation in India over the millenniums.[132]\n\n\n## Charts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

According to the UN's World Population dashboard, India's population now stands at slightly over 1.428 billion, edging past China's population of 1.425 billion people, as reported by the news agency Bloomberg.[9] its population is set to reach 1.7 billion by 2050.[10][11] In 2017 its population growth rate was 0.98%, ranking 112th in the world; in contrast, from 1972 to 1983, India's population grew by an annual rate of 2.3%.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, the median age of an Indian was 28.7 years,[13] compared to 38.4 for China and 48.6 for Japan; and, by 2030; India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4.[14] However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[15]\n\n\nIndia has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[16] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates: the Nihali language,[17] spoken in parts of Maharashtra, and the Burushaski language, spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. 1,000,000 people in India are Anglo-Indians and 700,000 United States citizens are living in India.[18] They represent over 0.1% of the total population of India. Overall, only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.[19]\n\n\nThe sex ratio was 944 females for 1000 males in 2016, and 940 per 1000 in 2011.[20] This ratio has been showing an upwards trend for the last two decades after a continuous decline in the 20th century.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economic history of India\n\n![](image)Historical population of India and China since 1100 with projection to 2100\n### Prehistory to early 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Estimates of historical world population\n\nThe following table lists estimates for the population of India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) from prehistory up until 1820.

population grew from the South Asian Stone Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate,[32] before population growth slowed down in the classical era up to 500 AD, and then became largely stagnant during the early medieval era era up to 1000 AD.[24][26] The population growth rate then increased in the late medieval era (during the Delhi Sultanate) from 1000 to 1500.[24][26]\n\n\nUnder the Mughal Empire, India experienced a high economic and demographic upsurge,[32] due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production.[33] 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India[34] and contemporary Europe[34] up until the 19th century.[35] These estimates by Abraham Eraly[34] and Paolo Malanima[35] have been criticised by Tim Dyson, who considers them exaggerations and estimates urbanisation of the Mughal Empire to be less than 9% of the population.[36]\n\n\nUnder the reign of Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe.[37] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[38] Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551–1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.[34] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[34] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people[39] and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people.[40] Mughal India also had a large number of villages, with 455,698 villages by the time of Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707).[37]\n\n\n\n### Late 19th century to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman.

Suggestions that it was the benefits of colonialism are refuted by academic thinking: \"There can be no serious, informed belief… that… late colonial era mortality diminished and population grew rapidly because of improvements in income, living standards, nutrition, environmental standards, sanitation or health policies, nor was there a cultural transformation…\".[47]\n\n\n\n## Salient features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crude birth rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 people, national average)[48][49][50]\n![](image)Infant mortality rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 births, under age 1, national average)\nIndia occupies 2.41% of the world's land area but supports over 18% of the world's population.

population exceeded that of the entire continent of Africa by 200 million people in 2010.[54] However, because Africa's population growth is nearly double that of India, it is expected to surpass both

Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that a birth sex ratio between 1.08 and 1.12 can be due to natural factors, such as the age of mother at the baby's birth, the age of father at conception, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, and others.[79] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to birth sex ratios (870–930 girls to 1000 boys) observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 and 2005. They are also similar to birth sex ratios (below 900 girls to 1000 boys) observed in mothers of different age groups and gestation periods in the United States.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Population within

ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[122][123] 700,000 people from the United States of any race live in India.[18] Between 300,000 and 1 million Anglo-Indians live in India.[124]\n\n\nFor a list of ethnic groups in the Republic of India (as well as neighbouring countries) see South Asian ethnic groups.\n\n\n\nLinguistic groups in India chart[125][126]\n\n\n\nIndo-Aryan (75%)\nDravidian (20%)\nKolarian, Tibeto-Burman, Khasi, Tai and others (5%)\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia\n\n### Y-chromosome DNA[edit]\n\n\n[127]\n\n\nY-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, The Indian Y-chromosome pool may be summarised as follows where haplogroups R-M420, H, R2, L and NOP comprise generally more than 80% of the total chromosomes.[128]\n\n\n\n* H ~ 30%\n* R1a ~ 34%\n* R2 ~ 15%\n* L ~ 10%\n* NOP ~ 10% (Excluding R)\n* Other Haplogroups 15%\n\n\n### Mitochondrial DNA[edit]\n\n\n[129]\n\n\nMitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage. The Indian mitochondrial DNA is primarily made up of Haplogroup M[130]\n\n\n\n* Haplogroup M ~ 60%\n* Haplogroup UK ~ 15%\n* Haplogroup N ~ 25% (Excluding UK)\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tripuri children preparing for a dance performance. The Tripuris are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.\nNumerous genomic studies have been conducted in the last 15 years to seek insights into India's demographic and cultural diversity. These studies paint a complex and conflicting picture.\n\n\n\n* In a 2003 study, Basu, Majumder *et al*. have concluded on the basis of results obtained from mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal markers that \"(1) there is an underlying unity of female lineages in India, indicating that the initial number of female settlers may have been small; (2) the tribal and the caste populations are highly differentiated; (3) the Austroasiatic tribals are the earliest settlers in India, providing support to one anthropological hypothesis while refuting some others; (4) a major wave of humans entered India through the northeast; (5) the Tibeto-Burman tribals share considerable genetic commonalities with the Austroasiatic tribals, supporting the hypothesis that they may have shared a common habitat in southern China, but the two groups of tribals can be differentiated on the basis of Y-chromosomal haplotypes; (6) the Dravidian speaking populations were possibly widespread throughout India but are regulated to South India now; (7) formation of populations by fission that resulted in founder and drift effects have left their imprints on the genetic structures of contemporary populations; (8) the upper castes show closer genetic affinities with Central Asian populations, although those of southern India are more distant than those of northern India; (9) historical gene flow into India has contributed to a considerable obliteration of genetic histories of contemporary populations so that there is at present no clear congruence of genetic and geographical or sociocultural affinities.\"[131]\n* In a later 2010 review article, Majumder affirms some of these conclusions, introduces and revises some other. The ongoing studies, concludes Majumder, suggest India has served as the major early corridor for geographical dispersal of modern humans from out-of-Africa. The archaeological and genetic traces of the earliest settlers in India has not provided any conclusive evidence. The tribal populations of India are older than the non-tribal populations. The autosomal differentiation and genetic diversity within India's caste populations at 0.04 is significantly lower than 0.14 for continental populations and 0.09 for 31 world population sets studied by Watkins *et al*., suggesting that while tribal populations were differentiated, the differentiation effects within India's caste population was less than previously thought. Majumder also concludes that recent studies suggest India has been a major contributor to the gene pool of southeast Asia.[132][133]\n* Another study covering a large sample of Indian populations allowed Watkins *et al*. to examine eight Indian caste groups and four endogamous south Indian tribal populations. The Indian castes data show low between-group differences, while the tribal Indian groups show relatively high between-group differentiation. This suggests that people between Indian castes were not reproductively isolated, while Indian tribal populations experienced reproductive isolation and drift. Furthermore, the genetic fixation index data show historical genetic differentiation and segregation between Indian castes population is much smaller than those found in east Asia, Africa and other continental populations; while being similar to the genetic differentiation and segregation observed in European populations.[133]\n* In 2006, Sahoo *et al*. reported their analysis of genomic data on 936 Y-chromosomes representing 32 tribal and 45 caste groups from different regions of India. These scientists find that the haplogroup frequency distribution across the country, between different caste groups, was found to be predominantly driven by geographical, rather than cultural determinants. They conclude there is clear evidence for both large-scale immigration into ancient India of Sino-Tibetan speakers and language change of former Austroasiatic speakers, in the northeast Indian region.[134][135]\n* The genome studies conducted up until 2010 have been on relatively small population sets. Many are from just one southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana, which was part of the state until June 2014). Thus, any conclusions on demographic history of India must be interpreted with caution. A larger national genome study with demographic growth and sex ratio balances may offer further insights on the extent of genetic differentiation and segregation in India over the millenniums.[132]\n\n\n## Charts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Approximately 55% of Indonesia's population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.\n\n\nDespite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,[3] Indonesia's average population growth per year was over 1.1% for the decade ending in 2020, nearly having 13% population growth for that decade. At this rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the recent population growth continues.[4]\n\n\nIndonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country's birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. The median age was 30.2 years in 2017.[5]\nIndonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Provinces of Indonesia by population

Approximately 55% of Indonesia's population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.\n\n\nDespite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,[3] Indonesia's average population growth per year was over 1.1% for the decade ending in 2020, nearly having 13% population growth for that decade. At this rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the recent population growth continues.[4]\n\n\nIndonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country's birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. The median age was 30.2 years in 2017.[5]\nIndonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Provinces of Indonesia by population

Javanese is the largest group with 100 million people (42%), followed by Sundanese, who number nearly 40 million (15%).\n\n\n\n## Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nReligion in Indonesia (2022)[20]\n\n\n\nIslam (87.02%)\nChristianity (10.49%)\nHinduism (1.69%)\nBuddhism (0.73%)\nFolk/Other (0.04%)\nConfucianism (0.03%)\n\nIndonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation; based on civil registration data in 2022 from Ministry of Home Affairs, 87.02% of Indonesians are Muslims, 10.49% Christians (7.43% Protestants, 3.06% Roman Catholic), 1.69% Hindu, 0.73% Buddhists, 0.03% Confucians and 0.04% other faiths.[20] Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese[21] and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are Chinese.[22]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Indonesia\n\nIndonesian is the official language, but there are many different languages native to Indonesia. According to Ethnologue, there are currently 737 living languages spoken in Indonesia,[23] the most widely spoken being Javanese and Sundanese. In Western New Guinea, there are more than 270 indigenous languages in spoken form.[24][25] Some Chinese varieties, most prominently Min Nan, are also spoken. The public use of Chinese, especially usage of Chinese characters, was dissuaded officially between 1966 and 1998.[26]\n\n\n\n## Literacy[edit]\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\n  \n*total population:* 92.81%\n  \n*male:* 95.5%\n  \n*female:* 90.4% (2011 est.)\n\n\nEducation is free in state schools; it is compulsory for children through to grade 12. Although about 92% of eligible children are enrolled in primary school, a much smaller percentage attend full-time. About 44% of secondary school-age children attend junior high school, and some others of this age group attend vocational schools.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid 2016\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook,[27] unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n**Age structure**\n\n\n\n*0-14 years:* 23.33%\n*15-64 years:* 70.72%\n*65 years and over:* 5.95% (2020 census)[28][29]\n**Median age**\n\n\n\n*total:* 31.1 years\n*male:* 30.5 years\n*female:* 31.8 years (2020 est.)\n**Birth rate**\n\n\n\n15.32 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Death rate**\n\n\n\n6.75 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Population growth rate**\n\n\n\n1.097% (2010 est.)\n1.04% (2012 est.)\n0.86% (2017 est.)\n0.79% (2022 est.)\n**Urbanization**\n\n\n\n*urban population:* 57.9% of total population (2022)\n*rate of urbanisation:* 1.99% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n**Sex ratio**\n\n\n\n*at birth:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*0-14 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*15-24 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*25-54 years:* 0.99 male(s)/female\n*55-64 years:* 0.98 male(s)/female\n*65 years and over:* 0.66 male(s)/female\n*total population:* 1 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n**Infant mortality rate**\n\n\n\n*total:* 19.73 deaths/1,000 live births\n*male:* 22.15 deaths/1,000 live births\n*female:* 17.18 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n**Life expectancy at birth**\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1927\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1960 by gender\n*total population:* 73.08 years\n*male:* 70.86 years\n*female:* 75.4 years (2022 est.)\n**Total fertility rate**\n\n\n\n2.01 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n**HIV/AIDS**\n\n\n\nAdult prevalence rate: 0.4% (2017 est.)\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS: 630,000 (2017 est.)\nHIV/AIDS deaths: 39,000 (2017 est.)\n**Obesity – adult prevalence rate**\n\n\n\n6.9% (2016)\n**Children under the age of 5 years underweight**\n\n\n\n19.9% (2013)\n**Nationality**\n\n\n\n*noun:* Indonesian(s)\n*adjective:* Indonesian\n*Ethnic groups:* Javanese 40.1%, Sundanese 15.5%, Malay 3.7%, Batak 3.6%, Madurese 3%, Betawi 2.9%, Minangkabau 2.7%, Buginese 2.7%, Bantenese 2%, Banjarese 1.7%, Balinese 1.7%, Acehnese 1.4%, Dayak 1.4%, Sasak 1.3%, Chinese 1.2%, other 15% (2010 est.)\n**Religions**\n\n\n\nMuslim 86.7%, Christianity 10.72% (Protestant 7.6% and Roman Catholic 3.12%), Hinduism 1.74%, other 0.8% (includes Buddhist and Confucian), unspecified 0.04% (2018 est.)\n**Languages**\n\n\n\nIndonesian (official, a form of Malay influenced by other languages of Indonesia), local languages (the most widely spoken of which is Javanese).\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n*total:* 11 years\n*male:* 12 years\n*female:* 11 years (2005)\n**Education expenditures**\n\n\n\n2.8% of GDP (2014)\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n\n\n* Census in Indonesia\n* Culture of Indonesia\n* Native Indonesians\n* Overseas Indonesian\n* Transmigration program\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2020\" (PDF) (in Indonesian).
