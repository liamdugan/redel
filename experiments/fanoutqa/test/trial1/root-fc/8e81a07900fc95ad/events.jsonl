It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.[1][2]\n\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938. Host nation  Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball. England's Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six. Belgium's Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance. It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid\n\n![](image)Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.\n![](image)The 100-ruble commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It features an image of Soviet goalkeeper Lev Yashin.\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.[3] Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings,[4] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.[5] During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid. As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.[6]\n\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[7] Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.[8]\n\n\nThe voting results were:[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n| Bidders\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Round 1\n | Round 2\n |\n| **Russia** | 9\n | 13\n |\n| Portugal / Spain\n | 7\n | 7\n |\n| Belgium / Netherlands\n | 4\n | 2\n |\n| England\n | 2\n | Eliminated\n |\n\n\n### Host selection criticism[edit]\n\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial. Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football,[9][10][11] human rights abuses by Russian authorities,[12][13] and discrimination against LGBT people in wider Russian society.[14][15] Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.[16][17] In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\".[18]\n\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues,[19] with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.[20][21] A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.[22][23][24] In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg's Zenit Arena.[25] By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers' International.[26][27] In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.[28]\n\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism,[29] with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.[30][31] In March 2015, FIFA's then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.[32] On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.[33] To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.[34]\n\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England's FA to boycott the tournament.[35] They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.[36] FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.[37] Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.[38][39] Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.[40][41] The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in Eckert's independence.[42]\n\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.[43][44] In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".[45][46] Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.[47][48]\n\n\n\n## Teams[edit]\n\n\n### Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.[49] Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches,[50][51] while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.[*citation needed*] Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.[52][53] The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC's qualification,[54][55][56] and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.[57][58]\n\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.[59] Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.[60]\n\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, and had qualified for the last three World Cups. Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify. The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.[61] The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.[62]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **AFC** (5)\n* ![](image) Australia (36)\n* ![](image) Iran (37)\n* ![](image) Japan (61)\n* ![](image) Saudi Arabia (67)\n* ![](image) South Korea (57)\n\n**CAF** (5)\n* ![](image) Egypt (45)\n* ![](image) Morocco (41)\n* ![](image) Nigeria (48)\n* ![](image) Senegal (27)\n* ![](image) Tunisia (21)\n\n\n | **CONCACAF** (3)\n* ![](image) Costa Rica (23)\n* ![](image) Mexico (15)\n* ![](image) Panama (55)\n\n**CONMEBOL** (5)\n* ![](image) Argentina (5)\n* ![](image) Brazil (2)\n* ![](image) Colombia (16)\n* ![](image) Peru (11)\n* ![](image) Uruguay (14)\n\n**OFC** (0)\n* *None qualified*\n\n\n | **UEFA** (14)\n* ![](image) Belgium (3)\n* ![](image) Croatia (20)\n* ![](image) Denmark (joint 12)\n* ![](image) England (joint 12)\n* ![](image) France (7)\n* ![](image) Germany (1)\n* ![](image) Iceland (22)\n* ![](image) Poland (8)\n* ![](image) Portugal (4)\n* ![](image) Russia (70) (hosts)\n* ![](image) Serbia (34)\n* ![](image) Spain (10)\n* ![](image) Sweden (24)\n* ![](image)  Switzerland (6)\n | ![](image)Qualified\n Did not qualify\n Disqualified\n Not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n### Draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\n![](image)Italian World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro in Moscow at the 2018 World Cup draw\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.[63][64] The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017. Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams. Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.[65] This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations. However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group. The pots for the draw are shown below.[66]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1\n | Pot 2\n | Pot 3\n | Pot 4\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Russia (65) *(hosts)*![](image) Germany (1)![](image) Brazil (2)![](image) Belgium (3)![](image) Portugal (4)![](image) Argentina (5)![](image) Poland (6)![](image) France (7)\n | ![](image) Spain (8)![](image) Peru (10)![](image)  Switzerland (11)![](image) England (12)![](image) Colombia (13)![](image) Mexico (16)![](image) Uruguay (17)![](image) Croatia (18)\n | ![](image) Denmark (19)![](image) Iceland (21)![](image) Costa Rica (22)![](image) Sweden (25)![](image) Tunisia (28)![](image) Egypt (30)![](image) Senegal (32)![](image) Iran (34)\n | ![](image) Serbia (38)![](image) Nigeria (41)![](image) Australia (43)![](image) Japan (44)![](image) Morocco (48)![](image) Panama (49)![](image) South Korea (62)![](image) Saudi Arabia (63)\n |\n\n\n### Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup squads\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.[67] From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June. Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match. These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.[68]\n\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.[69]\n\n\n\n## Officiating[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup officials\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.[70] On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.[71]\n\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt,[72] along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai. A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.[73][74] Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| List of officials\n |\n| --- |\n|

into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.[76][77]\n\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.[78] Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.[78]\n\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.[79] On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa's first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;[80] the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.[81] A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.[82] Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.[83] FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.[84]\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.[85] Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg,[86] which lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"[87]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.[88][*dead link*]\n\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.[89]\n\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.[90] He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.[92] On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.[93] Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\n\n\n### Stadiums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Exterior of Otkrytie Arena\nin Moscow\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.[94]\n\n\n\n* Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new). The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015. On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.\n* Kazan: Kazan Arena (new). The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade. It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.\n* Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated). The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013. It was commissioned in November 2017.\n* Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new). This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow. In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena. It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.\n* Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new). Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.[95]\n* Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new). The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don. Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.\n* Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new). Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared. The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.[96] It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.\n* Samara: Samara Arena (new). Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.\n* Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new). The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated). This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex. It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.[97]\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators. The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\n\n\n\n| Moscow | Saint Petersburg | Sochi |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Luzhniki Stadium | Otkritie Arena**(Spartak Stadium)** | Krestovsky Stadium**(Saint Petersburg Stadium)** | Fisht Olympic Stadium**(Fisht Stadium)** |\n| Capacity: **78,011**[98] | Capacity: **44,190**[99] | Capacity: **64,468**[100] | Capacity: **44,287**[101] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Volgograd | ![2018 FIFA World Cup is located in European Russia](image)![Moscow](image)\nMoscow\n![Saint Petersburg](image)\nSaint Petersburg\n![Kaliningrad](image)\nKaliningrad\n![Nizhny Novgorod](image)\nNizhny Novgorod\n![Kazan](image)\nKazan\n![Samara](image)\nSamara\n![Volgograd](image)\nVolgograd\n![Saransk](image)\nSaransk\n![Sochi](image)\nSochi\n![Rostov-on-Don](image)\nRostov-on-Don\n![Yekaterinburg](image)\nYekaterinburg\n | Rostov-on-Don |\n| Volgograd Arena | Rostov Arena |\n| Capacity: **43,713**[102] | Capacity: **43,472**[103] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Nizhny Novgorod | Kazan |\n| Nizhny Novgorod Stadium | Kazan Arena |\n| Capacity: **43,319**[104] | Capacity: **42,873**[105] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Samara | Saransk | Kaliningrad | Yekaterinburg |\n| Samara Arena | Mordovia Arena | Kaliningrad Stadium | Central Stadium**(Ekaterinburg Arena)** |\n| Capacity: **41,970**[106] | Capacity: **41,685**[107] | Capacity: **33,973**[108] | Capacity: **33,061**[109] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.

Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.[117] As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—\"Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure\"—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.[118] The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.[119] Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities. Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.[115]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure spending[edit]\n\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems. Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.[120] Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway. Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.[121] In Samara, new tram lines were laid.[122] Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.[123] Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.[120] On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned. The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd. In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.[124]\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volunteer flag bearers on the field prior to Belgium's *(flag depicted)* group stage match against Tunisia\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016. The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications,[125] and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.[126] They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities. Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.[127]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.[128][129][130]\n\n\n\n## Schedule[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Launching of a 1,000 days countdown in Moscow\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.[131][132] On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.[133][134]\n\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.[135] The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July. The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.[136][52]\n\n\n\n## Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Soprano Aida Garifullina and pop singer Robbie Williams singing \"Angels\" at the opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.[137][138]\n\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.[139] Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.[139] Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.[139] Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.[139] At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.[139]\n\n\nYoung participants of the international children's social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.[140]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage. Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round. This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014. No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982. The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards. Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless. Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.[141] All times listed below are local time.[133]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  Tie-breaking criteria for group play\n |\n| --- |\n| The ranking of teams in the group stage was determined as follows:[68][142]1. Points obtained in all group matches;\n2. Goal difference in all group matches;\n3. Number of goals scored in all group matches;\n4. Points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n5. Goal difference in the matches played between the teams in question;\n6. Number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n7. Fair play points in all group matches (only one deduction could be applied to a player in a single match): * Yellow card: −1 points;\n\t* Indirect red card (second yellow card): −3 points;\n\t* Direct red card: −4 points;\n\t* Yellow card and direct red card: −5 points;\n8.

Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by \"Russia's rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation\", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the \"heart and soul\" of the country.[*citation needed*] For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called *Dusha* – душа (Russian for 'soul') – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.[218]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.[219]\n\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.[*citation needed*] Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a \"Fan-ID\", a special photo identification pass. A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches. Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities. Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to \"ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order\".[128][129][130]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FIFA World Cup video games\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game *FIFA 18* that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.[220][221]\n\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.[222] Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.[223][224]\n\n\n\n## Symbols[edit]\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Zabivaka\n\n![](image)Tournament mascot, wolf Zabivaka\nThe tournament's official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students. A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf. The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team. Zabivaka's name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (\"hothead\") and забивать (\"to score\"), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is \"charming, confident and social\".[225]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Telstar 18\n\n![](image)Match ball \"Telstar 18\"\n![](image)Match ball for the knockout stage, \"Telstar Mechta\"\nThe official match ball, the \"Telstar 18\", was unveiled on 9 November 2017. It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.[226] A special red-coloured variation, \"Telstar Mechta\", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament. The word *mechta* (Russian: мечта) means \"dream\" or \"ambition\".[227]\n\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.[228][229] In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball's performance.[230][231]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Live It Up (Nicky Jam song)\n\nThe official song of the tournament was \"Live It Up\", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018. Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.[232]\n\n\n\n## Other controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2018 FIFA World Cup controversies\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.[233] On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.[234] On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.[235] FIFA's medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.[236]\n\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018. Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.[237] Reuters had raised concerns about the victims' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.[238][239] Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.[240][241]\n\n\n\n### Response to Skripal poisoning[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.[242] Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to \"take the World Cup out of Russia\".[243] The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson's statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism\".[244]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Facilities–such as the refurbished Luzhniki Stadium (pictured)–were one aspect of Russia's perceived success.\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it \"a resounding public relations success\" for Putin, adding: \"The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters. Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"[245]\n\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\",[246][247] fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.[248][249]\n\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\"[250] Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever.\" 98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.[251] It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup,[252] and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro),[253] the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.[254][255][256]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War. This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.[257][258] Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.[259] However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.[260]\n\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.[261][262][263] In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"beoutQ\". While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"[264][265]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo. The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.[266][267][268] Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014. Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network's history.[269][270]\n\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.[271]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA partners | FIFA World Cup sponsors | African supporters | Asian supporters | European supporters\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[272]\n* Coca-Cola[273]\n* Gazprom[274]\n* Hyundai–Kia[275]\n* Qatar Airways[276]\n | * Visa[277]\n* Wanda Group[278]\n\n\n |\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Anheuser-Busch InBev[279]\n* Hisense[280]\n* McDonald's[281]\n* Mengniu Dairy[282]\n* Vivo[283]\n | \n |\n | * Egypt – Experience & Invest[284]\n | * Diking[285]\n* Luci[285]\n* Yadea[286]\n | * Alfa-Bank[287]\n* Alrosa[288]\n* Rostelecom[289]\n* Russian Railways[290]\n |\n\n\n## Audience[edit]\n\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football's ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[291]\n\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224  billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014. However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014. Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014). However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).[292]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n* ![flag](image)Russia portal\n\n\n* FIFA World Cup\n* FIFA World Cup hosts\n* 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup\n* 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ellyatt, Holly (14 June 2018). \"The World Cup will give Russia's economy a boost — just don't expect it to last\".

It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.[1][2]\n\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938. Host nation  Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball. England's Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six. Belgium's Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance. It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid\n\n![](image)Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.\n![](image)The 100-ruble commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It features an image of Soviet goalkeeper Lev Yashin.\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.[3] Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings,[4] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.[5] During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid. As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.[6]\n\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[7] Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.[8]\n\n\nThe voting results were:[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n| Bidders\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Round 1\n | Round 2\n |\n| **Russia** | 9\n | 13\n |\n| Portugal / Spain\n | 7\n | 7\n |\n| Belgium / Netherlands\n | 4\n | 2\n |\n| England\n | 2\n | Eliminated\n |\n\n\n### Host selection criticism[edit]\n\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial. Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football,[9][10][11] human rights abuses by Russian authorities,[12][13] and discrimination against LGBT people in wider Russian society.[14][15] Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.[16][17] In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\".[18]\n\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues,[19] with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.[20][21] A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.[22][23][24] In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg's Zenit Arena.[25] By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers' International.[26][27] In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.[28]\n\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism,[29] with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.[30][31] In March 2015, FIFA's then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.[32] On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.[33] To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.[34]\n\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England's FA to boycott the tournament.[35] They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.[36] FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.[37] Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.[38][39] Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.[40][41] The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in Eckert's independence.[42]\n\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.[43][44] In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".[45][46] Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.[47][48]\n\n\n\n## Teams[edit]\n\n\n### Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.[49] Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches,[50][51] while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.[*citation needed*] Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.[52][53] The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC's qualification,[54][55][56] and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.[57][58]\n\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.[59] Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.[60]\n\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, and had qualified for the last three World Cups. Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify. The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.[61] The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.[62]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **AFC** (5)\n* ![](image) Australia (36)\n* ![](image) Iran (37)\n* ![](image) Japan (61)\n* ![](image) Saudi Arabia (67)\n* ![](image) South Korea (57)\n\n**CAF** (5)\n* ![](image) Egypt (45)\n* ![](image) Morocco (41)\n* ![](image) Nigeria (48)\n* ![](image) Senegal (27)\n* ![](image) Tunisia (21)\n\n\n | **CONCACAF** (3)\n* ![](image) Costa Rica (23)\n* ![](image) Mexico (15)\n* ![](image) Panama (55)\n\n**CONMEBOL** (5)\n* ![](image) Argentina (5)\n* ![](image) Brazil (2)\n* ![](image) Colombia (16)\n* ![](image) Peru (11)\n* ![](image) Uruguay (14)\n\n**OFC** (0)\n* *None qualified*\n\n\n | **UEFA** (14)\n* ![](image) Belgium (3)\n* ![](image) Croatia (20)\n* ![](image) Denmark (joint 12)\n* ![](image) England (joint 12)\n* ![](image) France (7)\n* ![](image) Germany (1)\n* ![](image) Iceland (22)\n* ![](image) Poland (8)\n* ![](image) Portugal (4)\n* ![](image) Russia (70) (hosts)\n* ![](image) Serbia (34)\n* ![](image) Spain (10)\n* ![](image) Sweden (24)\n* ![](image)  Switzerland (6)\n | ![](image)Qualified\n Did not qualify\n Disqualified\n Not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n### Draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\n![](image)Italian World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro in Moscow at the 2018 World Cup draw\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.[63][64] The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017. Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams. Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.[65] This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations. However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group. The pots for the draw are shown below.[66]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1\n | Pot 2\n | Pot 3\n | Pot 4\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Russia (65) *(hosts)*![](image) Germany (1)![](image) Brazil (2)![](image) Belgium (3)![](image) Portugal (4)![](image) Argentina (5)![](image) Poland (6)![](image) France (7)\n | ![](image) Spain (8)![](image) Peru (10)![](image)  Switzerland (11)![](image) England (12)![](image) Colombia (13)![](image) Mexico (16)![](image) Uruguay (17)![](image) Croatia (18)\n | ![](image) Denmark (19)![](image) Iceland (21)![](image) Costa Rica (22)![](image) Sweden (25)![](image) Tunisia (28)![](image) Egypt (30)![](image) Senegal (32)![](image) Iran (34)\n | ![](image) Serbia (38)![](image) Nigeria (41)![](image) Australia (43)![](image) Japan (44)![](image) Morocco (48)![](image) Panama (49)![](image) South Korea (62)![](image) Saudi Arabia (63)\n |\n\n\n### Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup squads\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.[67] From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June. Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match. These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.[68]\n\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.[69]\n\n\n\n## Officiating[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup officials\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.[70] On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.[71]\n\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt,[72] along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai. A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.[73][74] Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| List of officials\n |\n| --- |\n|

into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.[76][77]\n\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.[78] Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.[78]\n\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.[79] On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa's first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;[80] the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.[81] A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.[82] Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.[83] FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.[84]\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.[85] Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg,[86] which lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"[87]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.[88][*dead link*]\n\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.[89]\n\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.[90] He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.[92] On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.[93] Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\n\n\n### Stadiums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Exterior of Otkrytie Arena\nin Moscow\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.[94]\n\n\n\n* Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new). The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015. On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.\n* Kazan: Kazan Arena (new). The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade. It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.\n* Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated). The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013. It was commissioned in November 2017.\n* Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new). This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow. In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena. It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.\n* Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new). Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.[95]\n* Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new). The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don. Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.\n* Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new). Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared. The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.[96] It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.\n* Samara: Samara Arena (new). Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.\n* Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new). The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated). This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex. It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.[97]\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators. The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\n\n\n\n| Moscow | Saint Petersburg | Sochi |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Luzhniki Stadium | Otkritie Arena**(Spartak Stadium)** | Krestovsky Stadium**(Saint Petersburg Stadium)** | Fisht Olympic Stadium**(Fisht Stadium)** |\n| Capacity: **78,011**[98] | Capacity: **44,190**[99] | Capacity: **64,468**[100] | Capacity: **44,287**[101] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Volgograd | ![2018 FIFA World Cup is located in European Russia](image)![Moscow](image)\nMoscow\n![Saint Petersburg](image)\nSaint Petersburg\n![Kaliningrad](image)\nKaliningrad\n![Nizhny Novgorod](image)\nNizhny Novgorod\n![Kazan](image)\nKazan\n![Samara](image)\nSamara\n![Volgograd](image)\nVolgograd\n![Saransk](image)\nSaransk\n![Sochi](image)\nSochi\n![Rostov-on-Don](image)\nRostov-on-Don\n![Yekaterinburg](image)\nYekaterinburg\n | Rostov-on-Don |\n| Volgograd Arena | Rostov Arena |\n| Capacity: **43,713**[102] | Capacity: **43,472**[103] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Nizhny Novgorod | Kazan |\n| Nizhny Novgorod Stadium | Kazan Arena |\n| Capacity: **43,319**[104] | Capacity: **42,873**[105] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Samara | Saransk | Kaliningrad | Yekaterinburg |\n| Samara Arena | Mordovia Arena | Kaliningrad Stadium | Central Stadium**(Ekaterinburg Arena)** |\n| Capacity: **41,970**[106] | Capacity: **41,685**[107] | Capacity: **33,973**[108] | Capacity: **33,061**[109] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.

Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.[117] As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—\"Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure\"—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.[118] The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.[119] Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities. Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.[115]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure spending[edit]\n\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems. Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.[120] Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway. Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.[121] In Samara, new tram lines were laid.[122] Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.[123] Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.[120] On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned. The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd. In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.[124]\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volunteer flag bearers on the field prior to Belgium's *(flag depicted)* group stage match against Tunisia\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016. The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications,[125] and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.[126] They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities. Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.[127]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.[128][129][130]\n\n\n\n## Schedule[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Launching of a 1,000 days countdown in Moscow\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.[131][132] On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.[133][134]\n\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.[135] The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July. The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.[136][52]\n\n\n\n## Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Soprano Aida Garifullina and pop singer Robbie Williams singing \"Angels\" at the opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.[137][138]\n\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.[139] Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.[139] Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.[139] Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.[139] At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.[139]\n\n\nYoung participants of the international children's social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.[140]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage. Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round. This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014. No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982. The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards. Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless. Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.[141] All times listed below are local time.[133]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  Tie-breaking criteria for group play\n |\n| --- |\n| The ranking of teams in the group stage was determined as follows:[68][142]1. Points obtained in all group matches;\n2. Goal difference in all group matches;\n3. Number of goals scored in all group matches;\n4. Points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n5. Goal difference in the matches played between the teams in question;\n6. Number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n7. Fair play points in all group matches (only one deduction could be applied to a player in a single match): * Yellow card: −1 points;\n\t* Indirect red card (second yellow card): −3 points;\n\t* Direct red card: −4 points;\n\t* Yellow card and direct red card: −5 points;\n8.

Discipline[edit]\n\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.[209] International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.[210]\n\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:[68]\n\n\n\n* Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)\n* Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the

Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by \"Russia's rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation\", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the \"heart and soul\" of the country.[*citation needed*] For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called *Dusha* – душа (Russian for 'soul') – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.[218]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.[219]\n\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.[*citation needed*] Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a \"Fan-ID\", a special photo identification pass. A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches. Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities. Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to \"ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order\".[128][129][130]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FIFA World Cup video games\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game *FIFA 18* that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.[220][221]\n\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.[222] Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.[223][224]\n\n\n\n## Symbols[edit]\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Zabivaka\n\n![](image)Tournament mascot, wolf Zabivaka\nThe tournament's official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students. A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf. The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team. Zabivaka's name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (\"hothead\") and забивать (\"to score\"), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is \"charming, confident and social\".[225]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Telstar 18\n\n![](image)Match ball \"Telstar 18\"\n![](image)Match ball for the knockout stage, \"Telstar Mechta\"\nThe official match ball, the \"Telstar 18\", was unveiled on 9 November 2017. It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.[226] A special red-coloured variation, \"Telstar Mechta\", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament. The word *mechta* (Russian: мечта) means \"dream\" or \"ambition\".[227]\n\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.[228][229] In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball's performance.[230][231]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Live It Up (Nicky Jam song)\n\nThe official song of the tournament was \"Live It Up\", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018. Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.[232]\n\n\n\n## Other controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2018 FIFA World Cup controversies\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.[233] On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.[234] On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.[235] FIFA's medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.[236]\n\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018. Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.[237] Reuters had raised concerns about the victims' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.[238][239] Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.[240][241]\n\n\n\n### Response to Skripal poisoning[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.[242] Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to \"take the World Cup out of Russia\".[243] The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson's statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism\".[244]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Facilities–such as the refurbished Luzhniki Stadium (pictured)–were one aspect of Russia's perceived success.\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it \"a resounding public relations success\" for Putin, adding: \"The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters. Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"[245]\n\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\",[246][247] fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.[248][249]\n\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\"[250] Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever.\" 98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.[251] It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup,[252] and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro),[253] the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.[254][255][256]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War. This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.[257][258] Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.[259] However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.[260]\n\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.[261][262][263] In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"beoutQ\". While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"[264][265]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo. The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.[266][267][268] Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014. Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network's history.[269][270]\n\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.[271]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA partners | FIFA World Cup sponsors | African supporters | Asian supporters | European supporters\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[272]\n* Coca-Cola[273]\n* Gazprom[274]\n* Hyundai–Kia[275]\n* Qatar Airways[276]\n | * Visa[277]\n* Wanda Group[278]\n\n\n |\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Anheuser-Busch InBev[279]\n* Hisense[280]\n* McDonald's[281]\n* Mengniu Dairy[282]\n* Vivo[283]\n | \n |\n | * Egypt – Experience & Invest[284]\n | * Diking[285]\n* Luci[285]\n* Yadea[286]\n | * Alfa-Bank[287]\n* Alrosa[288]\n* Rostelecom[289]\n* Russian Railways[290]\n |\n\n\n## Audience[edit]\n\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football's ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[291]\n\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224  billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014. However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014. Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014). However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).[292]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n* ![flag](image)Russia portal\n\n\n* FIFA World Cup\n* FIFA World Cup hosts\n* 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup\n* 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ellyatt, Holly (14 June 2018). \"The World Cup will give Russia's economy a boost — just don't expect it to last\".

It took place in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2007. It was the second time that Brazil staged the competition, the first being in 1950, and the fifth time that it was held in South America.\n\n\n31 national teams advanced through qualification competitions to join the host nation in the final tournament (with Bosnia and Herzegovina as the only debutant). A total of 64 matches were played in 12 venues located in as many host cities across Brazil. For the first time at a World Cup finals, match officials used goal-line technology, as well as vanishing spray for free kicks.[6] FIFA Fan Fests in each host city gathered a total of 5 million people, and the country received 1 million visitors from 202 countries.[7] Spain, the defending champions, were eliminated at the group stage, along with England and Italy. Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16, and France exited in the quarter-finals. Host nation Brazil, who had won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, lost to Germany 7–1 in the semi-finals and eventually finished in fourth place.[8]\n\n\nIn the final, Germany defeated Argentina 1–0 after extra time thanks to a Mario Götze half-volley in the 113th minute of the final to win the tournament and secure the country's fourth world title, the first after German reunification in 1990, when as West Germany they also beat Argentina by the same score in 90 minutes in the World Cup final. Germany became the first European team to win a World Cup staged in the Americas,[9] and this result marked the third consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006 and Spain in 2010.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup bids\n\n![](image)Announcement of Brazil as hosts, 2007\nIn March 2003, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since 1978, in line with its policy at the time of rotating the right to host the World Cup among different confederations.[12][13] With the 2010 FIFA World Cup hosted in South Africa, it would be the second consecutive World Cup outside Europe, which was a first for the tournament. It was also sixth time (second consecutive) in the Southern Hemisphere.[14] Only Brazil and Colombia formally declared their candidacy but, after the withdrawal of the latter from the process,[15] Brazil was officially elected as host nation unopposed on 30 October 2007.[16]\n\n\n\n## Participating teams and officials[edit]\n\n\n### Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nSee also: FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nFollowing qualification matches played between June 2011 and November 2013, the following 32 teams – shown with their last pre-tournament FIFA world ranking[17] – qualified for the final tournament. Twenty-four of these teams were returning participants from the 2010 World Cup. Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only team with no previous appearance at the World Cup finals.[nb 1][18] Colombia qualified for the World Cup after 16 years of absence, while Belgium and Russia both returned after 12 years. Paraguay failed to qualify for the first time since 1994. This was also the first World Cup for 32 years that did not feature a representative from the Nordic countries. Iran, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Croatia returned to the tournament after missing the 2010 tournament. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Ukraine (ranked 16th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Australia (ranked 62nd).[17]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AFC (4)* ![](image) Australia (62)\n* ![](image) Iran (43)\n* ![](image) Japan (46)\n* ![](image) South Korea (57)\n\nCAF (5)* ![](image) Algeria (22)\n* ![](image) Cameroon (56)\n* ![](image) Ghana (37)\n* ![](image) Ivory Coast (23)\n* ![](image) Nigeria (44)\n\nOFC (0)* *None qualified*\n | CONCACAF (4)* ![](image) Costa Rica (28)\n* ![](image) Honduras (33)\n* ![](image) Mexico (20)\n* ![](image) United States (13)\n\nCONMEBOL (6)* ![](image) Argentina (5)\n* ![](image) Brazil (3) (hosts)\n* ![](image) Chile (14)\n* ![](image) Colombia (8)\n* ![](image) Ecuador (26)\n* ![](image) Uruguay (7)\n\n\n | UEFA (13)* ![](image) Belgium (11)\n* ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (21)\n* ![](image) Croatia (18)\n* ![](image) England (10)\n* ![](image) France (17)\n* ![](image) Germany (2)\n* ![](image) Greece (12)\n* ![](image) Italy (9)\n* ![](image) Netherlands (15)\n* ![](image) Portugal (4)\n* ![](image) Russia (19)\n* ![](image) Spain (1)\n* ![](image)  Switzerland (6)\n | ![](image)|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Qualified\n Did not qualify\n | Did not enter\n Not a FIFA member\n |\n\n\n |\n\n\n\n| Teams listed by FIFA ranking as of June 2014[17] |\n| --- |\n|  | Country | Confederation | Rank\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Spain | UEFA | 1\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Germany | UEFA | 2\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Brazil (host) | CONMEBOL | 3\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Portugal | UEFA | 4\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Argentina | CONMEBOL | 5\n |\n| 6 | ![](image)  Switzerland | UEFA | 6\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Uruguay | CONMEBOL | 7\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Colombia | CONMEBOL | 8\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Italy | UEFA | 9\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) England | UEFA | 10\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Belgium | UEFA | 11\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Greece | UEFA | 12\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) United States | CONCACAF | 13\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Chile | CONMEBOL | 14\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Netherlands | UEFA | 15\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) France | UEFA | 17\n |\n| 17 | ![](image) Croatia | UEFA | 18\n |\n| 18 | ![](image) Russia | UEFA | 19\n |\n| 19 | ![](image) Mexico | CONCACAF | 20\n |\n| 20 | ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina | UEFA | 21\n |\n| 21 | ![](image) Algeria | CAF | 22\n |\n| 22 | ![](image) Ivory Coast | CAF | 23\n |\n| 23 | ![](image) Ecuador | CONMEBOL | 26\n |\n| 24 | ![](image) Costa Rica | CONCACAF | 28\n |\n| 25 | ![](image) Honduras | CONCACAF | 33\n |\n| 26 | ![](image) Ghana | CAF | 37\n |\n| 27 | ![](image) Iran | AFC | 43\n |\n| 28 | ![](image) Nigeria | CAF | 44\n |\n| 29 | ![](image) Japan | AFC | 46\n |\n| 30 | ![](image) Cameroon | CAF | 56\n |\n| 31 | ![](image) South Korea | AFC | 57\n |\n| 32 | ![](image) Australia | AFC | 62\n |\n\n\nAs of 2022, this was the last time Chile, Ivory Coast, Greece, Italy, Honduras, and Algeria qualified for the World Cup finals, and the only time Bosnia and Herzegovina have qualified, and the last time Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Denmark, Poland, and Serbia failed to qualify. This was also the most recent World Cup finals to feature every prior winning team.\n\n\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\nThe 32 participating teams were drawn into eight groups. In preparation for this, the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highest-ranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot.[19] As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations.[20][21] The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia, during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cup-winning players.[22][23] Under the draw procedure, one randomly drawn team – Italy – was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams.[24]\n\n\n\n### Officials[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup officials\n\nIn March 2013, FIFA published a list of 52 prospective referees, each paired, on the basis of nationality, with two assistant referees, from all six football confederations for the tournament. On 14 January 2014, the FIFA Referees Committee appointed 25 referee trios and eight support duos representing 43 countries for the tournament.[25][26]\nYuichi Nishimura from Japan acted as referee in the opening match whereas Nicola Rizzoli from Italy acted as referee in the final.[27][28]\n\n\n\n\n\n| List of officials\n |\n| --- |\n| Confederation\n | Referee\n | Assistants\n | Support (referee/assist)\n |\n| AFC | Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan)\n | Abdukhamidullo Rasulov (Uzbekistan) | Bakhadyr Kochkarov (Kyrgyzstan)\n | Alireza Faghani (Iran) / Hassan Kamranifar (Iran)\n |\n| Yuichi Nishimura (Japan)\n | Toru Sagara (Japan) | Toshiyuki Nagi (Japan)\n |\n| Nawaf Shukralla (Bahrain)\n | Yaser Tulefat (Bahrain) | Ebrahim Saleh (Bahrain)\n |\n| Ben Williams (Australia)\n | Matthew Cream (Australia) | Hakan Anaz (Australia)\n |\n| CAF | Noumandiez Doué (Ivory Coast)\n | Songuifolo Yeo (Ivory Coast) | Jean-Claude Birumushahu (Burundi)\n | Néant Alioum (Cameroon) / Djibril Camara (Senegal) |\n| Bakary Gassama (Gambia)\n | Evarist Menkouande (Cameroon) | Félicien Kabanda (Rwanda)\n |\n| Djamel Haimoudi (Algeria)\n | Redouane Achik (Morocco) | Abdelhak Etchiali (Algeria)\n |\n| CONCACAF | Joel Aguilar (El Salvador)\n | William Torres (El Salvador) | Juan Zumba (El Salvador)\n | Roberto Moreno (Panama) / Eric Boria (United States)Walter López (Guatemala) / Leonel Leal (Costa Rica)\n |\n| Mark Geiger (United States)\n | Mark Hurd (United States) | Joe Fletcher (Canada)\n |\n| Marco Rodríguez (Mexico)\n | Marvin Torrentera (Mexico) | Marcos Quintero (Mexico)\n |\n| CONMEBOL | Néstor Pitana (Argentina)\n | Hernán Maidana (Argentina) | Juan Pablo Belatti (Argentina)\n | Víctor Hugo Carrillo (Peru) / Rodney Aquino (Paraguay)\n |\n| Sandro Ricci (Brazil)\n | Emerson De Carvalho (Brazil) | Marcelo Van Gasse (Brazil)\n |\n| Enrique Osses (Chile)\n | Carlos Astroza (Chile) | Sergio Román (Chile)\n |\n| Wilmar Roldán (Colombia)\n | Humberto Clavijo (Colombia) | Eduardo Díaz (Colombia)\n |\n| Carlos Vera (Ecuador)\n | Christian Lescano (Ecuador) | Byron Romero (Ecuador)\n |\n| OFC | Peter O'Leary (New Zealand)\n | Jan Hendrik Hintz (New Zealand) | Mark Rule (New Zealand)\n | Norbert Hauata (Tahiti) / Aden Marwa (Kenya)\n |\n| UEFA | Felix Brych (Germany)\n | Mark Borsch (Germany) | Stefan Lupp (Germany)\n | Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) / Kim Haglund (Norway)\n |\n| Cüneyt Çakır (Turkey)\n | Bahattin Duran (Turkey) | Tarık Ongun (Turkey)\n |\n| Jonas Eriksson (Sweden)\n | Mathias Klasenius (Sweden) | Daniel Wärnmark (Sweden)\n |\n| Björn Kuipers (Netherlands)\n | Sander van Roekel (Netherlands) | Erwin Zeinstra (Netherlands)\n |\n| Milorad Mažić (Serbia)\n | Milovan Ristić (Serbia) | Dalibor Đurđević (Serbia)\n |\n| Pedro Proença (Portugal)\n | Bertino Miranda (Portugal) | Tiago Trigo (Portugal)\n |\n| Nicola Rizzoli (Italy)\n | Renato Faverani (Italy) | Andrea Stefani (Italy)\n |\n| Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain)\n | Roberto Alonso Fernández (Spain) | Juan Carlos Yuste Jiménez (Spain)\n |\n| Howard Webb (England)\n | Michael Mullarkey (England) | Darren Cann (England)\n |\n\n\n### Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup squads\n\nAs with the 2010 tournament, each team's squad consisted of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers). Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad no later than 10 days before the start of the tournament.[29] Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.[29] During a match, all remaining squad members not named in the starting team were available to be one of the three permitted substitutions (provided the player was not serving a suspension).[29]\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup venues\n\n12 venues (seven new and five renovated) in twelve cities were selected for the tournament. The venues covered all the main regions of Brazil and created more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 finals in Brazil.[30] Consequently, the tournament required long-distance travel for teams.[31] During the World Cup, Brazilian cities were also home to the participating teams at 32 separate base camps,[32] as well as staging official fan fests where supporters could view the games.[33]\n\n\nThe most used stadiums were the Maracanã and Brasilia, which hosted seven matches each. The least-used venues were in Cuiabá, Manaus, Natal, and Curitiba, which hosted four matches each; as the four smallest stadiums in use at the tournament, they did not host any knockout round matches.[34]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rio de Janeiro City, Rio de Janeiro | Brasília, Federal District | São Paulo City, São Paulo | Fortaleza, Ceará |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Estádio do Maracanã | Estádio Nacional | Arena Corinthians **(Arena de São Paulo)** | Estádio Castelão |\n| Capacity: **74,738**[34] | Capacity: **69,432**[34] | Capacity: **63,321**[34] | Capacity: **60,348**[34] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais | ![2014 FIFA World Cup is located in Brazil](image)![Belo Horizonte](image)\nBelo Horizonte\n![Brasília](image)\nBrasília\n![Fortaleza](image)\nFortaleza\n![Porto Alegre](image)\nPorto Alegre\n![São Paulo](image)\nSão Paulo\n![Rio de Janeiro](image)\nRio de Janeiro\n![Salvador](image)\nSalvador\n![Natal](image)\nNatal\n![Cuiabá](image)\nCuiabá\n![Curitiba](image)\nCuritiba\n![Manaus](image)\nManaus\n![Recife](image)\nRecife\n | Salvador, Bahia |\n| Estádio Mineirão | Arena Fonte Nova |\n| Capacity: **58,259**[34] | Capacity: **51,708**[34] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul | Recife, Pernambuco[nb 2] |\n| Estádio Beira-Rio | Arena Pernambuco |\n| Capacity: **43,394**[34] | Capacity: **42,583**[34] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Cuiabá, Mato Grosso | Manaus, Amazonas | Natal, Rio Grande do Norte | Curitiba, Paraná |\n| Arena Pantanal | Arena da Amazônia | Arena das Dunas | Arena da Baixada |\n| Capacity: **41,112**[34] | Capacity: **40,549**[34] | Capacity: **39,971**[34] | Capacity: **39,631**[34] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team,[32] having earlier circulated a brochure of 84 prospective locations.[35] Most teams opted to stay in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with only eight teams choosing other regions; five teams (Croatia, Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) opted to stay in the Northeast Region and three teams (Ecuador, South Korea and Spain) opted to stay in the South Region. None opted to stay in the North Region or the Central-West Region.[36] Campo Bahia, the base camp of the eventual champion Germany, attracted much interest.[37]\n\n\n\n\n\n| National squads' base camps\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Team\n | City\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Algeria\n | Sorocaba, SP |\n| Argentina\n | Vespasiano, MG |\n| Australia\n | Vitória, ES |\n| Belgium\n | Mogi das Cruzes, SP |\n| Bosnia and Herzegovina\n | Guarujá, SP |\n| Brazil\n | Teresópolis, RJ |\n| Cameroon\n | Vitória, ES |\n| Chile\n | Belo Horizonte, MG |\n| Colombia\n | Cotia, SP |\n| Costa Rica\n | Santos, SP |\n| Croatia\n | Mata de São João, BA |\n| Ecuador\n | Viamão, RS |\n| England\n | Rio de Janeiro, RJ |\n| France\n | Ribeirão Preto, SP |\n| Germany\n | Campo Bahia, BA\n |\n| Ghana\n | Maceió, AL |\n\n | \n\n| Team\n | City\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Greece\n | Aracaju, SE |\n| Honduras\n | Porto Feliz, SP |\n| Iran\n | Guarulhos, SP |\n| Italy\n | Mangaratiba, RJ |\n| Ivory Coast\n | Águas de Lindoia, SP |\n| Japan\n | Itu, SP |\n| South Korea\n | Foz do Iguaçu, PR |\n| Mexico\n | Santos, SP |\n| Netherlands\n | Rio de Janeiro, RJ |\n| Nigeria\n | Campinas, SP |\n| Portugal\n | Campinas, SP |\n| Russia\n | Itu, SP |\n| Spain\n | Curitiba, PR |\n| Switzerland\n | Porto Seguro, BA |\n| United States\n | São Paulo, SP |\n| Uruguay\n | Sete Lagoas, MG |\n\n |\n\n\n### FIFA Fan Fests[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brazilian fans at the FIFA Fan Fest in Brasília\nFor a third consecutive World Cup tournament, FIFA staged FIFA Fan Fests in each of the 12 host cities throughout the competition. Prominent examples were the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and São Paulo's Vale do Anhangabaú.[38][39] The first official event took place on Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014.[40]\n\n\n\n## Innovations[edit]\n\n\n### Technologies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Adidas Brazuca\nIn order to avoid ghost goals, the 2014 World Cup introduced goal-line technology following successful trials at among others 2013 Confederations Cup. The chosen Goal Control system featured 14 high speed cameras, 7 directed to each of the goals. Data were sent to the central image-processing centre, where a virtual representation of the ball was output on a widescreen to confirm the goal. The referee was equipped with a watch which vibrated and displayed a signal upon a goal.[41][42][43] France's second goal in their group game against Honduras was the first time goal-line technology was needed to confirm that a goal should be given.[44]\n\n\nFollowing successful trials,[nb 3] FIFA approved the use of vanishing spray by the referees for the first time at a World Cup Finals. The water-based spray, which disappears within minutes of application, can be used to mark a ten-yard line for the defending team during a free kick and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free kick.[45]\n\n\nThe Adidas Brazuca was the official match ball of the 2014 FIFA World Cup[46][47][48][49] and was supplied by Forward Sports of Sialkot, Pakistan.[46] Adidas created a new design of ball after criticisms of the Adidas Jabulani used in the previous World Cup. The number of panels was reduced to six, with the panels being thermally bonded. This created a ball with increased consistency and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet the approval of football professionals.\n\n\n\n### Cooling breaks[edit]\n\n\nDue to the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks for the players were introduced.[50] Breaks could take place at the referee's discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeded 32 °C (90 °F); the breaks would last 3 minutes, with this time made up by an extended period of stoppage time at the end of the half.\n\n\nThe first cooling break in a World Cup play took place during the 32nd minute of the match between the Netherlands and Mexico in the round of 16.[51][52][53][54] At the start of the match, FIFA listed the temperature at 32 °C (90 °F) with 68% humidity.[55]\n\n\n\n### Anti-doping[edit]\n\n\nThe biological passport was introduced in the FIFA World Cup starting in 2014. Blood and urine samples collected from all players before the competition, and from two players per team per match, were analysed by the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses.[56] FIFA reported that 91.5% of the players taking part in the tournament were tested before the start of the competition and none tested positive.[57] However, FIFA was criticised for how it conducted doping tests.[58][59]\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\n\nThe first round, or group stage, was a competition between the 32 teams divided among eight groups of four, where each group engaged in a round-robin tournament within itself. The two highest ranked teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage.[29] Teams were awarded three points for a win and one for a draw. When comparing teams in a group over-all result came before head-to-head.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tie-breaking criteria for group play\n |\n| --- |\n| The ranking of teams in each group was based on the following criteria:\n1. Number of points\n2. Goal difference\n3. Number of goals scored\n4. Number of points obtained in matches between tied teams\n5. Goal difference in matches between tied teams\n6. Number of goals scored in matches between tied teams\n7. Drawing of lots\n |\n\n\nIn the knockout stage there were four rounds (round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final), with each eliminating the losers. The two semi-final losers competed in a third place play-off. For any match in the knockout stage, a draw after 90 minutes of regulation time was followed by two 15 minute periods of extra time to determine a winner. If the teams were still tied, a penalty shoot-out was held to determine a winner.[29]\n\n\nThe match schedule was announced on 20 October 2011[60] with the kick-off times being confirmed on 27 September 2012;[61] after the final draw, the kick-off times of seven matches were adjusted by FIFA.[62] The competition was organised so that teams that played each other in the group stage could not meet again during the knockout phase until the final (or the 3rd place match).[29]\nThe group stage began on 12 June, with the host nation competing in the opening game as has been the format since the 2006 tournament. The opening game was preceded by an opening ceremony that began at 15:15 local time.[63]\n\n\n\n## Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Claudia Leitte, Pitbull, and Jennifer Lopez performing at the opening ceremony at the Arena de São Paulo, São Paulo.\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony\n\nOn 12 June 2014, the 20th edition of the FIFA World Cup began with the opening ceremony at Arena de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. The event saw 660 dancers take to the stadium and perform in a ceremony which celebrated the nature of the country and its love of football. Following the dancers native singer Claudia Leitte emerged on centre stage to perform for the crowd. She was later joined by Cuban-American rapper Pitbull, and American singer Jennifer Lopez to perform the tournament's official song \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" which had been released as an official single on 8 April 2014. Following the ceremony, the opening match was played, which saw the hosts come from behind to beat Croatia 3–1.[64][65][66]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\nThe group stage of the cup took place in Brazil from 12 June 2014 to 26 June 2014: each team played three games. The group stage was notable for a scarcity of draws and a large number of goals. The first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930.[67] The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament.[68] This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998[69] and the largest average in a group stage since 1958.[70] World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy's from the 1950 tournament.[71] Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002.[72] For the first time, two teams from Africa advanced to the second round, a feat that would be repeated in the 2022 tournament.\n\n\n\n### Group

They included four teams from UEFA, three from CONMEBOL, and one from CONCACAF. Of the eight matches, five required extra-time, and two of these required penalty shoot-outs; this was the first time penalty shoot-outs occurred in more than one game in a round of 16.[nb 4] The goal average per game in the round of 16 was 2.25, a drop of 0.58 goals per game from the group stage.[78] The eight teams to win in the round of 16 included four former champions (Brazil, Germany, Argentina and France), a three-time runner-up (Netherlands), and two first-time quarter-finalists (Colombia and Costa Rica).[79][80] Belgium reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 1986.[81]\n\n\n*All times listed below are at local time (UTC−3)*\n\n\n\n28 June 2014\n13:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Chile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * David Luiz ![](image) 18'\n | Report | * Sánchez ![](image) 32'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * David Luiz ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Willian ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Marcelo ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Hulk ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Neymar ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 3–2 | * ![soccer ball with red X](image) Pinilla\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Sánchez\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Aránguiz\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Díaz\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Jara\n |\n\nEstádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte\nAttendance: 57,714\nReferee: Howard Webb (England)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n28 June 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Colombia ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Uruguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Rodríguez ![](image) 28', 50'\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio do Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro\nAttendance: 73,804\nReferee: Björn Kuipers (Netherlands)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n29 June 2014\n13:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Netherlands ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Mexico |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Sneijder ![](image) 88'\n* Huntelaar ![](image) 90+4' (pen.)\n | Report | * Dos Santos ![](image) 48'\n |\n\nEstádio Castelão, Fortaleza\nAttendance: 58,817\nReferee: Pedro Proença (Portugal)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n29 June 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Costa Rica ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Greece |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ruiz ![](image) 52'\n | Report | * Papastathopoulos ![](image) 90+1'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Borges ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Ruiz ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* González ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Campbell ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Umaña ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 5–3 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Mitroglou\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Christodoulopoulos\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Holebas\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Gekas\n |\n\nItaipava Arena Pernambuco, Recife\nAttendance: 41,242\nReferee: Ben Williams (Australia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n30 June 2014\n13:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Nigeria |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Pogba ![](image) 79'\n* Yobo ![](image) 90+2' (o.g.)\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio Nacional Mané Garrincha, Brasília\nAttendance: 67,882\nReferee: Mark Geiger (United States)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n30 June 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 2–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Algeria |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Schürrle ![](image) 92'\n* Özil ![](image) 120'\n | Report | * Djabou ![](image) 120+1'\n |\n\nEstádio Beira-Rio, Porto Alegre\nAttendance: 43,063\nReferee: Sandro Ricci (Brazil)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2014\n13:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Argentina ![](image) | 1–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Di María ![](image) 118'\n | Report |  |\n\nArena Corinthians, São Paulo\nAttendance: 63,255\nReferee: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Belgium ![](image) | 2–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * De Bruyne ![](image) 93'\n* Lukaku ![](image) 105'\n | Report | * Green ![](image) 107'\n |\n\nItaipava Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador\nAttendance: 51,227\nReferee: Djamel Haimoudi (Algeria)\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\nWith a 1–0 victory over France, Germany set a World Cup record with four consecutive semi-final appearances.

Miroslav Klose's goal in this match was his 16th throughout all World Cups, breaking the record he had previously shared with Ronaldo.[82] Klose set another record by becoming the first player to appear in four World Cup semi-finals.[83] Argentina reached their first final since 1990, and their fifth overall, after overcoming the Netherlands in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw at the end of extra time.\n\n\n\nMain article: Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)\n\n8 July 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 1–7 | ![](image) Germany |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Oscar ![](image) 90'\n | Report | * Müller ![](image) 11'\n* Klose ![](image) 23'\n* Kroos ![](image) 24', 26'\n* Khedira ![](image) 29'\n* Schürrle ![](image) 69', 79'\n |\n\nEstádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte\nAttendance: 58,141\nReferee: Marco Antonio Rodríguez (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n9 July 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Netherlands ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Argentina |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Vlaar ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Robben ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Sneijder ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Kuyt ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 2–4 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Messi\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Garay\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Agüero\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Rodríguez\n |\n\nArena Corinthians, São Paulo\nAttendance: 63,267\nReferee: Cüneyt Çakır (Turkey)\n\n### Third place play-off[edit]\n\n\nThe Netherlands defeated Brazil 3–0 to secure third place, the first for the Dutch team in their history. Overall, Brazil conceded 14 goals in the tournament; this was the most by a team at any single World Cup since 1986, and the most by a host nation in history, although their fourth-place finish still represented Brazil's best result in a World Cup since their last win in 2002.[84]\n\n\n\n12 July 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 0–3 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Van Persie ![](image) 3' (pen.)\n* Blind ![](image) 17'\n* Wijnaldum ![](image) 90+1'\n |\n\nEstádio Nacional Mané Garrincha, Brasília\nAttendance: 68,034\nReferee: Djamel Haimoudi (Algeria)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup final\n\nThe final featured Germany against Argentina for a record third time after 1986 and 1990.\n\n\n\n13 July 2014\n16:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 1–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Argentina |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Götze ![](image) 113' | Report |  |\n\nMaracanã Stadium, Rio de Janeiro\nAttendance: 74,738\nReferee: Nicola Rizzoli (Italy)\n\nThis marked the first time that teams from the same continent had won three consecutive World Cups (following Italy in 2006 and Spain in 2010).

Suárez, who was suspended for nine international matches and banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months, following a biting incident on Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini.

The project was completed at a cost of US$900 million, against an original budget of US$300 million, making the stadium the second-most expensive football stadium in the world after England's Wembley Stadium.\nCosts of the tournament totalled $11.6 billion,[106] making it the most expensive World Cup to date,[107] until surpassed by 2018 FIFA World Cup which cost an estimated $14.2 billion.[106] FIFA was expected to spend US$2 billion on staging the finals,[108] with its greatest single expense being the US$576 million prize money pot.[104]\n\n\nAlthough organisers originally estimated costs of US$1.1 billion,[109] a reported US$3.6 billion was ultimately spent on stadium works.[110][111] Five of the chosen host cities had brand new venues built specifically for the World Cup, while the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha in the capital Brasília was demolished and rebuilt, with the remaining six being extensively renovated.[112]\n\n\nAn additional R$3 billion (US$1.3 billion, €960 million, £780 million at June 2014 rates) was earmarked by the Brazilian government for investment in infrastructure works and projects for use during the 2014 World Cup and beyond.[113] However, the failed completion of many of the proposed works provoked discontent among some Brazilians.[114][115][116]\n\n\nThe Brazilian government pledged US$900 million to be invested into security forces and that the tournament would be \"one of the most protected sports events in history.\"[117]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup marketing\n\nThe marketing of the 2014 FIFA World Cup included sale of tickets, support from sponsors and promotion through events that utilise the symbols and songs of the tournament. Popular merchandise included items featuring the official mascot as well as an official video game that has been developed by EA Sports.[118] As a partner of the German Football Association, part of German major airline Lufthansa's fleet was branded \"Fanhansa\" for the time being. Branded planes flew the Germany national team, media representatives and football fans to Brazil.[119]\n\n\nThe Sony Xperia Z2 was dubbed the \"official smartphone of the 2014 FIFA World Cup\".[120]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe sponsors of the 2014 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA partners | FIFA World Cup sponsors | National supporters\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adidas\n* Coca-Cola\n* Emirates\n* Hyundai–Kia\n* Sony\n* Visa\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Anheuser-Busch InBev\n* Castrol\n* Continental\n* McDonald's\n* Johnson & Johnson\n | * Marfrig\n* Yingli Solar\n* Oi\n\n\n |\n | * Apex-Brasil\n* Garoto\n* Centauro\n* Banco Itaú\n* Liberty Seguros\n* Wiseup\n |\n\n\n## Symbols[edit]\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fuleco\n\nThe official mascot of this World Cup was \"Fuleco\"[122]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Brazuca\n\n![](image)Brazuca\nThe official match ball was \"Brazuca\", manufactured by Adidas.[123]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: One Love, One Rhythm – The 2014 FIFA World Cup Official Album\n\nThe official song of the tournament was \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" with vocals from Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte.[124]\n\n\nThe official mascot song was \"Tatu Bom de Bola\".\n\n\nThe official anthem was \"Dar um Jeito (We Will Find a Way)\".\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2014 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n\nFor a fourth consecutive FIFA World Cup Finals, the coverage was provided by HBS (Host Broadcast Services), a subsidiary of Infront Sports & Media.[125] Sony was selected as the official equipment provider and built 12 bespoke high definition production 40-foot-long containers, one for each tournament venue, to house the extensive amount of equipment required.[126][127] Each match utilised 37 standard camera plans, including Aerial and Cablecam, two Ultramotion cameras and dedicated cameras for interviews.[127] The official tournament film, as well as three matches,[nb 5] will be filmed with ultra high definition technology (4K resolution), following a successful trial at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.[128]\n\n\nThe broadcasting rights – covering television, radio, internet and mobile coverage – for the tournament were sold to media companies in each individual territory either directly by FIFA, or through licensed companies or organisations such as the European Broadcasting Union, Organización de Televisión Iberoamericana, International Media Content, Dentsu and RS International Broadcasting & Sports Management.[129] The sale of these rights accounted for an estimated 60% of FIFA's income from staging a World Cup.[130] The International Broadcast Centre was situated at the Riocentro in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro.[131][132]\n\n\nWorldwide, several games qualified as the most-watched sporting events in their country in 2014, including 42.9 million people in Brazil for the opening game between Brazil and Croatia, the 34.1 million in Japan who saw their team play Ivory Coast, and 34.7 million in Germany who saw their national team win the World Cup against Argentina,[133] while the 24.7 million viewers during the game between the US and Portugal is joint with the 2010 final as the most-watched football game in the United States.[134] According to FIFA, over 1 billion people tuned in worldwide to watch the final between Germany and Argentina.[135]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies\n\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup generated various controversies, including demonstrations, some of which took place even before the tournament started. Furthermore, there were various issues with safety, including the death of eight workers and a fire during construction, breaches into stadiums, an unstable makeshift staircase at the Maracanã Stadium, a monorail collapse, and the collapse of an unfinished overpass in Belo Horizonte.[136][137][138][139][140] The houses of thousands of families living in Rio de Janeiro’s slums were cleared for redevelopments for the World Cup in spite of protests and resistance. Favela do Metrô, near the Maracanã Stadium, was completely destroyed as a result, having previously housed 700 families in 2010.[141][142][143]\n\n\n\n### Protests[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anti-World Cup demonstration on the opening day\nFurther information: List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies § Protests\n\nSee also: 2013 protests in Brazil and 2014 protests in Brazil\n\nPrior to the opening ceremony of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup staged in Brazil, demonstrations took place outside the venue, organised by people unhappy with the amount of public money spent to enable the hosting of the FIFA World Cup.[144] Both the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff and FIFA president Sepp Blatter were heavily booed as they were announced to give their speeches at the 2013 tournament's opening,[145] which resulted in FIFA announcing that the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony would not feature any speeches.[146] Further protests took place during the Confederations Cup as well as prior to and during the World Cup.[147][148][149][150][151]\n\n\n\n### Breaches into stadiums[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies § Breaches into stadiums\n\nAt the Group B match between Spain and Chile, around 100 Chilean supporters who had gathered outside Maracanã Stadium forced their way into the stadium and caused damage to the media centre. Military police reported that 85 Chileans were detained during the events, while others reached the stands. Earlier, about 20 Argentinians made a similar breach during Argentina's Group F game against Bosnia and Herzegovina at the same stadium.[152][153]\n\n\n\n### Bridge collapse[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Belo Horizonte overpass collapse\n\nOn 3 July 2014, an overpass under construction in Belo Horizonte as part of the World Cup infrastructure projects collapsed onto a busy carriageway below, leaving two people dead and 22 others injured.[154][155]\n\n\n\n### Head injuries[edit]\n\n\nDuring the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious.[156] The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.[157]\n\n\nSecond, in the Final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup Final.[158]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup\n* FIFA World Cup\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Bosnia and Herzegovina was until 1992 part of Yugoslavia, which competed at eight World Cup tournaments.\n2. **^** The Arena Pernambuco is located in São Lourenço da Mata, Recife.\n3. **^** The spray was trialled at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup, 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup and 2013 FIFA Club World Cup\n4. **^** In 1938's round of 16, two games were also tied after extra-time, but those were replayed instead.\n5. **^** Those matches scheduled to be filmed in ultra high definition were one match from the round of 16 (on 28 June), one quarter-final (on 4 July) and the final\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Players – Top goals\". *FIFA.com*.

It took place in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2007. It was the second time that Brazil staged the competition, the first being in 1950, and the fifth time that it was held in South America.\n\n\n31 national teams advanced through qualification competitions to join the host nation in the final tournament (with Bosnia and Herzegovina as the only debutant). A total of 64 matches were played in 12 venues located in as many host cities across Brazil. For the first time at a World Cup finals, match officials used goal-line technology, as well as vanishing spray for free kicks.[6] FIFA Fan Fests in each host city gathered a total of 5 million people, and the country received 1 million visitors from 202 countries.[7] Spain, the defending champions, were eliminated at the group stage, along with England and Italy. Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16, and France exited in the quarter-finals. Host nation Brazil, who had won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, lost to Germany 7–1 in the semi-finals and eventually finished in fourth place.[8]\n\n\nIn the final, Germany defeated Argentina 1–0 after extra time thanks to a Mario Götze half-volley in the 113th minute of the final to win the tournament and secure the country's fourth world title, the first after German reunification in 1990, when as West Germany they also beat Argentina by the same score in 90 minutes in the World Cup final. Germany became the first European team to win a World Cup staged in the Americas,[9] and this result marked the third consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006 and Spain in 2010.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup bids\n\n![](image)Announcement of Brazil as hosts, 2007\nIn March 2003, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since 1978, in line with its policy at the time of rotating the right to host the World Cup among different confederations.[12][13] With the 2010 FIFA World Cup hosted in South Africa, it would be the second consecutive World Cup outside Europe, which was a first for the tournament. It was also sixth time (second consecutive) in the Southern Hemisphere.[14] Only Brazil and Colombia formally declared their candidacy but, after the withdrawal of the latter from the process,[15] Brazil was officially elected as host nation unopposed on 30 October 2007.[16]\n\n\n\n## Participating teams and officials[edit]\n\n\n### Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nSee also: FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nFollowing qualification matches played between June 2011 and November 2013, the following 32 teams – shown with their last pre-tournament FIFA world ranking[17] – qualified for the final tournament. Twenty-four of these teams were returning participants from the 2010 World Cup. Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only team with no previous appearance at the World Cup finals.[nb 1][18] Colombia qualified for the World Cup after 16 years of absence, while Belgium and Russia both returned after 12 years. Paraguay failed to qualify for the first time since 1994. This was also the first World Cup for 32 years that did not feature a representative from the Nordic countries. Iran, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Croatia returned to the tournament after missing the 2010 tournament. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Ukraine (ranked 16th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Australia (ranked 62nd).[17]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AFC (4)* ![](image) Australia (62)\n* ![](image) Iran (43)\n* ![](image) Japan (46)\n* ![](image) South Korea (57)\n\nCAF (5)* ![](image) Algeria (22)\n* ![](image) Cameroon (56)\n* ![](image) Ghana (37)\n* ![](image) Ivory Coast (23)\n* ![](image) Nigeria (44)\n\nOFC (0)* *None qualified*\n | CONCACAF (4)* ![](image) Costa Rica (28)\n* ![](image) Honduras (33)\n* ![](image) Mexico (20)\n* ![](image) United States (13)\n\nCONMEBOL (6)* ![](image) Argentina (5)\n* ![](image) Brazil (3) (hosts)\n* ![](image) Chile (14)\n* ![](image) Colombia (8)\n* ![](image) Ecuador (26)\n* ![](image) Uruguay (7)\n\n\n | UEFA (13)* ![](image) Belgium (11)\n* ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (21)\n* ![](image) Croatia (18)\n* ![](image) England (10)\n* ![](image) France (17)\n* ![](image) Germany (2)\n* ![](image) Greece (12)\n* ![](image) Italy (9)\n* ![](image) Netherlands (15)\n* ![](image) Portugal (4)\n* ![](image) Russia (19)\n* ![](image) Spain (1)\n* ![](image)  Switzerland (6)\n | ![](image)|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Qualified\n Did not qualify\n | Did not enter\n Not a FIFA member\n |\n\n\n |\n\n\n\n| Teams listed by FIFA ranking as of June 2014[17] |\n| --- |\n|  | Country | Confederation | Rank\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Spain | UEFA | 1\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Germany | UEFA | 2\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Brazil (host) | CONMEBOL | 3\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Portugal | UEFA | 4\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Argentina | CONMEBOL | 5\n |\n| 6 | ![](image)  Switzerland | UEFA | 6\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Uruguay | CONMEBOL | 7\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Colombia | CONMEBOL | 8\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Italy | UEFA | 9\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) England | UEFA | 10\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Belgium | UEFA | 11\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Greece | UEFA | 12\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) United States | CONCACAF | 13\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Chile | CONMEBOL | 14\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Netherlands | UEFA | 15\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) France | UEFA | 17\n |\n| 17 | ![](image) Croatia | UEFA | 18\n |\n| 18 | ![](image) Russia | UEFA | 19\n |\n| 19 | ![](image) Mexico | CONCACAF | 20\n |\n| 20 | ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina | UEFA | 21\n |\n| 21 | ![](image) Algeria | CAF | 22\n |\n| 22 | ![](image) Ivory Coast | CAF | 23\n |\n| 23 | ![](image) Ecuador | CONMEBOL | 26\n |\n| 24 | ![](image) Costa Rica | CONCACAF | 28\n |\n| 25 | ![](image) Honduras | CONCACAF | 33\n |\n| 26 | ![](image) Ghana | CAF | 37\n |\n| 27 | ![](image) Iran | AFC | 43\n |\n| 28 | ![](image) Nigeria | CAF | 44\n |\n| 29 | ![](image) Japan | AFC | 46\n |\n| 30 | ![](image) Cameroon | CAF | 56\n |\n| 31 | ![](image) South Korea | AFC | 57\n |\n| 32 | ![](image) Australia | AFC | 62\n |\n\n\nAs of 2022, this was the last time Chile, Ivory Coast, Greece, Italy, Honduras, and Algeria qualified for the World Cup finals, and the only time Bosnia and Herzegovina have qualified, and the last time Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Denmark, Poland, and Serbia failed to qualify. This was also the most recent World Cup finals to feature every prior winning team.\n\n\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\nThe 32 participating teams were drawn into eight groups. In preparation for this, the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highest-ranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot.[19] As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations.[20][21] The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia, during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cup-winning players.[22][23] Under the draw procedure, one randomly drawn team – Italy – was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams.[24]\n\n\n\n### Officials[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup officials\n\nIn March 2013, FIFA published a list of 52 prospective referees, each paired, on the basis of nationality, with two assistant referees, from all six football confederations for the tournament. On 14 January 2014, the FIFA Referees Committee appointed 25 referee trios and eight support duos representing 43 countries for the tournament.[25][26]\nYuichi Nishimura from Japan acted as referee in the opening match whereas Nicola Rizzoli from Italy acted as referee in the final.[27][28]\n\n\n\n\n\n| List of officials\n |\n| --- |\n| Confederation\n | Referee\n | Assistants\n | Support (referee/assist)\n |\n| AFC | Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan)\n | Abdukhamidullo Rasulov (Uzbekistan) | Bakhadyr Kochkarov (Kyrgyzstan)\n | Alireza Faghani (Iran) / Hassan Kamranifar (Iran)\n |\n| Yuichi Nishimura (Japan)\n | Toru Sagara (Japan) | Toshiyuki Nagi (Japan)\n |\n| Nawaf Shukralla (Bahrain)\n | Yaser Tulefat (Bahrain) | Ebrahim Saleh (Bahrain)\n |\n| Ben Williams (Australia)\n | Matthew Cream (Australia) | Hakan Anaz (Australia)\n |\n| CAF | Noumandiez Doué (Ivory Coast)\n | Songuifolo Yeo (Ivory Coast) | Jean-Claude Birumushahu (Burundi)\n | Néant Alioum (Cameroon) / Djibril Camara (Senegal) |\n| Bakary Gassama (Gambia)\n | Evarist Menkouande (Cameroon) | Félicien Kabanda (Rwanda)\n |\n| Djamel Haimoudi (Algeria)\n | Redouane Achik (Morocco) | Abdelhak Etchiali (Algeria)\n |\n| CONCACAF | Joel Aguilar (El Salvador)\n | William Torres (El Salvador) | Juan Zumba (El Salvador)\n | Roberto Moreno (Panama) / Eric Boria (United States)Walter López (Guatemala) / Leonel Leal (Costa Rica)\n |\n| Mark Geiger (United States)\n | Mark Hurd (United States) | Joe Fletcher (Canada)\n |\n| Marco Rodríguez (Mexico)\n | Marvin Torrentera (Mexico) | Marcos Quintero (Mexico)\n |\n| CONMEBOL | Néstor Pitana (Argentina)\n | Hernán Maidana (Argentina) | Juan Pablo Belatti (Argentina)\n | Víctor Hugo Carrillo (Peru) / Rodney Aquino (Paraguay)\n |\n| Sandro Ricci (Brazil)\n | Emerson De Carvalho (Brazil) | Marcelo Van Gasse (Brazil)\n |\n| Enrique Osses (Chile)\n | Carlos Astroza (Chile) | Sergio Román (Chile)\n |\n| Wilmar Roldán (Colombia)\n | Humberto Clavijo (Colombia) | Eduardo Díaz (Colombia)\n |\n| Carlos Vera (Ecuador)\n | Christian Lescano (Ecuador) | Byron Romero (Ecuador)\n |\n| OFC | Peter O'Leary (New Zealand)\n | Jan Hendrik Hintz (New Zealand) | Mark Rule (New Zealand)\n | Norbert Hauata (Tahiti) / Aden Marwa (Kenya)\n |\n| UEFA | Felix Brych (Germany)\n | Mark Borsch (Germany) | Stefan Lupp (Germany)\n | Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) / Kim Haglund (Norway)\n |\n| Cüneyt Çakır (Turkey)\n | Bahattin Duran (Turkey) | Tarık Ongun (Turkey)\n |\n| Jonas Eriksson (Sweden)\n | Mathias Klasenius (Sweden) | Daniel Wärnmark (Sweden)\n |\n| Björn Kuipers (Netherlands)\n | Sander van Roekel (Netherlands) | Erwin Zeinstra (Netherlands)\n |\n| Milorad Mažić (Serbia)\n | Milovan Ristić (Serbia) | Dalibor Đurđević (Serbia)\n |\n| Pedro Proença (Portugal)\n | Bertino Miranda (Portugal) | Tiago Trigo (Portugal)\n |\n| Nicola Rizzoli (Italy)\n | Renato Faverani (Italy) | Andrea Stefani (Italy)\n |\n| Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain)\n | Roberto Alonso Fernández (Spain) | Juan Carlos Yuste Jiménez (Spain)\n |\n| Howard Webb (England)\n | Michael Mullarkey (England) | Darren Cann (England)\n |\n\n\n### Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup squads\n\nAs with the 2010 tournament, each team's squad consisted of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers). Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad no later than 10 days before the start of the tournament.[29] Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.[29] During a match, all remaining squad members not named in the starting team were available to be one of the three permitted substitutions (provided the player was not serving a suspension).[29]\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup venues\n\n12 venues (seven new and five renovated) in twelve cities were selected for the tournament. The venues covered all the main regions of Brazil and created more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 finals in Brazil.[30] Consequently, the tournament required long-distance travel for teams.[31] During the World Cup, Brazilian cities were also home to the participating teams at 32 separate base camps,[32] as well as staging official fan fests where supporters could view the games.[33]\n\n\nThe most used stadiums were the Maracanã and Brasilia, which hosted seven matches each. The least-used venues were in Cuiabá, Manaus, Natal, and Curitiba, which hosted four matches each; as the four smallest stadiums in use at the tournament, they did not host any knockout round matches.[34]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rio de Janeiro City, Rio de Janeiro | Brasília, Federal District | São Paulo City, São Paulo | Fortaleza, Ceará |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Estádio do Maracanã | Estádio Nacional | Arena Corinthians **(Arena de São Paulo)** | Estádio Castelão |\n| Capacity: **74,738**[34] | Capacity: **69,432**[34] | Capacity: **63,321**[34] | Capacity: **60,348**[34] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais | ![2014 FIFA World Cup is located in Brazil](image)![Belo Horizonte](image)\nBelo Horizonte\n![Brasília](image)\nBrasília\n![Fortaleza](image)\nFortaleza\n![Porto Alegre](image)\nPorto Alegre\n![São Paulo](image)\nSão Paulo\n![Rio de Janeiro](image)\nRio de Janeiro\n![Salvador](image)\nSalvador\n![Natal](image)\nNatal\n![Cuiabá](image)\nCuiabá\n![Curitiba](image)\nCuritiba\n![Manaus](image)\nManaus\n![Recife](image)\nRecife\n | Salvador, Bahia |\n| Estádio Mineirão | Arena Fonte Nova |\n| Capacity: **58,259**[34] | Capacity: **51,708**[34] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul | Recife, Pernambuco[nb 2] |\n| Estádio Beira-Rio | Arena Pernambuco |\n| Capacity: **43,394**[34] | Capacity: **42,583**[34] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Cuiabá, Mato Grosso | Manaus, Amazonas | Natal, Rio Grande do Norte | Curitiba, Paraná |\n| Arena Pantanal | Arena da Amazônia | Arena das Dunas | Arena da Baixada |\n| Capacity: **41,112**[34] | Capacity: **40,549**[34] | Capacity: **39,971**[34] | Capacity: **39,631**[34] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team,[32] having earlier circulated a brochure of 84 prospective locations.[35] Most teams opted to stay in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with only eight teams choosing other regions; five teams (Croatia, Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) opted to stay in the Northeast Region and three teams (Ecuador, South Korea and Spain) opted to stay in the South Region. None opted to stay in the North Region or the Central-West Region.[36] Campo Bahia, the base camp of the eventual champion Germany, attracted much interest.[37]\n\n\n\n\n\n| National squads' base camps\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Team\n | City\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Algeria\n | Sorocaba, SP |\n| Argentina\n | Vespasiano, MG |\n| Australia\n | Vitória, ES |\n| Belgium\n | Mogi das Cruzes, SP |\n| Bosnia and Herzegovina\n | Guarujá, SP |\n| Brazil\n | Teresópolis, RJ |\n| Cameroon\n | Vitória, ES |\n| Chile\n | Belo Horizonte, MG |\n| Colombia\n | Cotia, SP |\n| Costa Rica\n | Santos, SP |\n| Croatia\n | Mata de São João, BA |\n| Ecuador\n | Viamão, RS |\n| England\n | Rio de Janeiro, RJ |\n| France\n | Ribeirão Preto, SP |\n| Germany\n | Campo Bahia, BA\n |\n| Ghana\n | Maceió, AL |\n\n | \n\n| Team\n | City\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Greece\n | Aracaju, SE |\n| Honduras\n | Porto Feliz, SP |\n| Iran\n | Guarulhos, SP |\n| Italy\n | Mangaratiba, RJ |\n| Ivory Coast\n | Águas de Lindoia, SP |\n| Japan\n | Itu, SP |\n| South Korea\n | Foz do Iguaçu, PR |\n| Mexico\n | Santos, SP |\n| Netherlands\n | Rio de Janeiro, RJ |\n| Nigeria\n | Campinas, SP |\n| Portugal\n | Campinas, SP |\n| Russia\n | Itu, SP |\n| Spain\n | Curitiba, PR |\n| Switzerland\n | Porto Seguro, BA |\n| United States\n | São Paulo, SP |\n| Uruguay\n | Sete Lagoas, MG |\n\n |\n\n\n### FIFA Fan Fests[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brazilian fans at the FIFA Fan Fest in Brasília\nFor a third consecutive World Cup tournament, FIFA staged FIFA Fan Fests in each of the 12 host cities throughout the competition. Prominent examples were the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and São Paulo's Vale do Anhangabaú.[38][39] The first official event took place on Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014.[40]\n\n\n\n## Innovations[edit]\n\n\n### Technologies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Adidas Brazuca\nIn order to avoid ghost goals, the 2014 World Cup introduced goal-line technology following successful trials at among others 2013 Confederations Cup. The chosen Goal Control system featured 14 high speed cameras, 7 directed to each of the goals. Data were sent to the central image-processing centre, where a virtual representation of the ball was output on a widescreen to confirm the goal. The referee was equipped with a watch which vibrated and displayed a signal upon a goal.[41][42][43] France's second goal in their group game against Honduras was the first time goal-line technology was needed to confirm that a goal should be given.[44]\n\n\nFollowing successful trials,[nb 3] FIFA approved the use of vanishing spray by the referees for the first time at a World Cup Finals. The water-based spray, which disappears within minutes of application, can be used to mark a ten-yard line for the defending team during a free kick and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free kick.[45]\n\n\nThe Adidas Brazuca was the official match ball of the 2014 FIFA World Cup[46][47][48][49] and was supplied by Forward Sports of Sialkot, Pakistan.[46] Adidas created a new design of ball after criticisms of the Adidas Jabulani used in the previous World Cup. The number of panels was reduced to six, with the panels being thermally bonded. This created a ball with increased consistency and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet the approval of football professionals.\n\n\n\n### Cooling breaks[edit]\n\n\nDue to the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks for the players were introduced.[50] Breaks could take place at the referee's discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeded 32 °C (90 °F); the breaks would last 3 minutes, with this time made up by an extended period of stoppage time at the end of the half.\n\n\nThe first cooling break in a World Cup play took place during the 32nd minute of the match between the Netherlands and Mexico in the round of 16.[51][52][53][54] At the start of the match, FIFA listed the temperature at 32 °C (90 °F) with 68% humidity.[55]\n\n\n\n### Anti-doping[edit]\n\n\nThe biological passport was introduced in the FIFA World Cup starting in 2014. Blood and urine samples collected from all players before the competition, and from two players per team per match, were analysed by the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses.[56] FIFA reported that 91.5% of the players taking part in the tournament were tested before the start of the competition and none tested positive.[57] However, FIFA was criticised for how it conducted doping tests.[58][59]\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\n\nThe first round, or group stage, was a competition between the 32 teams divided among eight groups of four, where each group engaged in a round-robin tournament within itself. The two highest ranked teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage.[29] Teams were awarded three points for a win and one for a draw. When comparing teams in a group over-all result came before head-to-head.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tie-breaking criteria for group play\n |\n| --- |\n| The ranking of teams in each group was based on the following criteria:\n1. Number of points\n2. Goal difference\n3. Number of goals scored\n4. Number of points obtained in matches between tied teams\n5. Goal difference in matches between tied teams\n6. Number of goals scored in matches between tied teams\n7. Drawing of lots\n |\n\n\nIn the knockout stage there were four rounds (round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final), with each eliminating the losers. The two semi-final losers competed in a third place play-off. For any match in the knockout stage, a draw after 90 minutes of regulation time was followed by two 15 minute periods of extra time to determine a winner. If the teams were still tied, a penalty shoot-out was held to determine a winner.[29]\n\n\nThe match schedule was announced on 20 October 2011[60] with the kick-off times being confirmed on 27 September 2012;[61] after the final draw, the kick-off times of seven matches were adjusted by FIFA.[62] The competition was organised so that teams that played each other in the group stage could not meet again during the knockout phase until the final (or the 3rd place match).[29]\nThe group stage began on 12 June, with the host nation competing in the opening game as has been the format since the 2006 tournament. The opening game was preceded by an opening ceremony that began at 15:15 local time.[63]\n\n\n\n## Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Claudia Leitte, Pitbull, and Jennifer Lopez performing at the opening ceremony at the Arena de São Paulo, São Paulo.\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony\n\nOn 12 June 2014, the 20th edition of the FIFA World Cup began with the opening ceremony at Arena de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. The event saw 660 dancers take to the stadium and perform in a ceremony which celebrated the nature of the country and its love of football. Following the dancers native singer Claudia Leitte emerged on centre stage to perform for the crowd. She was later joined by Cuban-American rapper Pitbull, and American singer Jennifer Lopez to perform the tournament's official song \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" which had been released as an official single on 8 April 2014. Following the ceremony, the opening match was played, which saw the hosts come from behind to beat Croatia 3–1.[64][65][66]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\nThe group stage of the cup took place in Brazil from 12 June 2014 to 26 June 2014: each team played three games. The group stage was notable for a scarcity of draws and a large number of goals. The first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930.[67] The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament.[68] This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998[69] and the largest average in a group stage since 1958.[70] World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy's from the 1950 tournament.[71] Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002.[72] For the first time, two teams from Africa advanced to the second round, a feat that would be repeated in the 2022 tournament.\n\n\n\n### Group

They included four teams from UEFA, three from CONMEBOL, and one from CONCACAF. Of the eight matches, five required extra-time, and two of these required penalty shoot-outs; this was the first time penalty shoot-outs occurred in more than one game in a round of 16.[nb 4] The goal average per game in the round of 16 was 2.25, a drop of 0.58 goals per game from the group stage.[78] The eight teams to win in the round of 16 included four former champions (Brazil, Germany, Argentina and France), a three-time runner-up (Netherlands), and two first-time quarter-finalists (Colombia and Costa Rica).[79][80] Belgium reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 1986.[81]\n\n\n*All times listed below are at local time (UTC−3)*\n\n\n\n28 June 2014\n13:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Chile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * David Luiz ![](image) 18'\n | Report | * Sánchez ![](image) 32'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * David Luiz ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Willian ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Marcelo ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Hulk ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Neymar ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 3–2 | * ![soccer ball with red X](image) Pinilla\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Sánchez\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Aránguiz\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Díaz\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Jara\n |\n\nEstádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte\nAttendance: 57,714\nReferee: Howard Webb (England)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n28 June 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Colombia ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Uruguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Rodríguez ![](image) 28', 50'\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio do Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro\nAttendance: 73,804\nReferee: Björn Kuipers (Netherlands)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n29 June 2014\n13:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Netherlands ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Mexico |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Sneijder ![](image) 88'\n* Huntelaar ![](image) 90+4' (pen.)\n | Report | * Dos Santos ![](image) 48'\n |\n\nEstádio Castelão, Fortaleza\nAttendance: 58,817\nReferee: Pedro Proença (Portugal)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n29 June 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Costa Rica ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Greece |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ruiz ![](image) 52'\n | Report | * Papastathopoulos ![](image) 90+1'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Borges ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Ruiz ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* González ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Campbell ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Umaña ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 5–3 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Mitroglou\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Christodoulopoulos\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Holebas\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Gekas\n |\n\nItaipava Arena Pernambuco, Recife\nAttendance: 41,242\nReferee: Ben Williams (Australia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n30 June 2014\n13:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Nigeria |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Pogba ![](image) 79'\n* Yobo ![](image) 90+2' (o.g.)\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio Nacional Mané Garrincha, Brasília\nAttendance: 67,882\nReferee: Mark Geiger (United States)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n30 June 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 2–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Algeria |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Schürrle ![](image) 92'\n* Özil ![](image) 120'\n | Report | * Djabou ![](image) 120+1'\n |\n\nEstádio Beira-Rio, Porto Alegre\nAttendance: 43,063\nReferee: Sandro Ricci (Brazil)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2014\n13:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Argentina ![](image) | 1–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Di María ![](image) 118'\n | Report |  |\n\nArena Corinthians, São Paulo\nAttendance: 63,255\nReferee: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Belgium ![](image) | 2–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * De Bruyne ![](image) 93'\n* Lukaku ![](image) 105'\n | Report | * Green ![](image) 107'\n |\n\nItaipava Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador\nAttendance: 51,227\nReferee: Djamel Haimoudi (Algeria)\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\nWith a 1–0 victory over France, Germany set a World Cup record with four consecutive semi-final appearances.

Miroslav Klose's goal in this match was his 16th throughout all World Cups, breaking the record he had previously shared with Ronaldo.[82] Klose set another record by becoming the first player to appear in four World Cup semi-finals.[83] Argentina reached their first final since 1990, and their fifth overall, after overcoming the Netherlands in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw at the end of extra time.\n\n\n\nMain article: Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)\n\n8 July 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 1–7 | ![](image) Germany |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Oscar ![](image) 90'\n | Report | * Müller ![](image) 11'\n* Klose ![](image) 23'\n* Kroos ![](image) 24', 26'\n* Khedira ![](image) 29'\n* Schürrle ![](image) 69', 79'\n |\n\nEstádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte\nAttendance: 58,141\nReferee: Marco Antonio Rodríguez (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n9 July 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Netherlands ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Argentina |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Vlaar ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Robben ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Sneijder ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Kuyt ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 2–4 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Messi\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Garay\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Agüero\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Rodríguez\n |\n\nArena Corinthians, São Paulo\nAttendance: 63,267\nReferee: Cüneyt Çakır (Turkey)\n\n### Third place play-off[edit]\n\n\nThe Netherlands defeated Brazil 3–0 to secure third place, the first for the Dutch team in their history. Overall, Brazil conceded 14 goals in the tournament; this was the most by a team at any single World Cup since 1986, and the most by a host nation in history, although their fourth-place finish still represented Brazil's best result in a World Cup since their last win in 2002.[84]\n\n\n\n12 July 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 0–3 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Van Persie ![](image) 3' (pen.)\n* Blind ![](image) 17'\n* Wijnaldum ![](image) 90+1'\n |\n\nEstádio Nacional Mané Garrincha, Brasília\nAttendance: 68,034\nReferee: Djamel Haimoudi (Algeria)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup final\n\nThe final featured Germany against Argentina for a record third time after 1986 and 1990.\n\n\n\n13 July 2014\n16:00 BRT (UTC−3)\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 1–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Argentina |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Götze ![](image) 113' | Report |  |\n\nMaracanã Stadium, Rio de Janeiro\nAttendance: 74,738\nReferee: Nicola Rizzoli (Italy)\n\nThis marked the first time that teams from the same continent had won three consecutive World Cups (following Italy in 2006 and Spain in 2010).

Suárez, who was suspended for nine international matches and banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months, following a biting incident on Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini.

The project was completed at a cost of US$900 million, against an original budget of US$300 million, making the stadium the second-most expensive football stadium in the world after England's Wembley Stadium.\nCosts of the tournament totalled $11.6 billion,[106] making it the most expensive World Cup to date,[107] until surpassed by 2018 FIFA World Cup which cost an estimated $14.2 billion.[106] FIFA was expected to spend US$2 billion on staging the finals,[108] with its greatest single expense being the US$576 million prize money pot.[104]\n\n\nAlthough organisers originally estimated costs of US$1.1 billion,[109] a reported US$3.6 billion was ultimately spent on stadium works.[110][111] Five of the chosen host cities had brand new venues built specifically for the World Cup, while the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha in the capital Brasília was demolished and rebuilt, with the remaining six being extensively renovated.[112]\n\n\nAn additional R$3 billion (US$1.3 billion, €960 million, £780 million at June 2014 rates) was earmarked by the Brazilian government for investment in infrastructure works and projects for use during the 2014 World Cup and beyond.[113] However, the failed completion of many of the proposed works provoked discontent among some Brazilians.[114][115][116]\n\n\nThe Brazilian government pledged US$900 million to be invested into security forces and that the tournament would be \"one of the most protected sports events in history.\"[117]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup marketing\n\nThe marketing of the 2014 FIFA World Cup included sale of tickets, support from sponsors and promotion through events that utilise the symbols and songs of the tournament. Popular merchandise included items featuring the official mascot as well as an official video game that has been developed by EA Sports.[118] As a partner of the German Football Association, part of German major airline Lufthansa's fleet was branded \"Fanhansa\" for the time being. Branded planes flew the Germany national team, media representatives and football fans to Brazil.[119]\n\n\nThe Sony Xperia Z2 was dubbed the \"official smartphone of the 2014 FIFA World Cup\".[120]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe sponsors of the 2014 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA partners | FIFA World Cup sponsors | National supporters\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adidas\n* Coca-Cola\n* Emirates\n* Hyundai–Kia\n* Sony\n* Visa\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Anheuser-Busch InBev\n* Castrol\n* Continental\n* McDonald's\n* Johnson & Johnson\n | * Marfrig\n* Yingli Solar\n* Oi\n\n\n |\n | * Apex-Brasil\n* Garoto\n* Centauro\n* Banco Itaú\n* Liberty Seguros\n* Wiseup\n |\n\n\n## Symbols[edit]\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fuleco\n\nThe official mascot of this World Cup was \"Fuleco\"[122]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Brazuca\n\n![](image)Brazuca\nThe official match ball was \"Brazuca\", manufactured by Adidas.[123]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: One Love, One Rhythm – The 2014 FIFA World Cup Official Album\n\nThe official song of the tournament was \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" with vocals from Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte.[124]\n\n\nThe official mascot song was \"Tatu Bom de Bola\".\n\n\nThe official anthem was \"Dar um Jeito (We Will Find a Way)\".\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2014 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n\nFor a fourth consecutive FIFA World Cup Finals, the coverage was provided by HBS (Host Broadcast Services), a subsidiary of Infront Sports & Media.[125] Sony was selected as the official equipment provider and built 12 bespoke high definition production 40-foot-long containers, one for each tournament venue, to house the extensive amount of equipment required.[126][127] Each match utilised 37 standard camera plans, including Aerial and Cablecam, two Ultramotion cameras and dedicated cameras for interviews.[127] The official tournament film, as well as three matches,[nb 5] will be filmed with ultra high definition technology (4K resolution), following a successful trial at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.[128]\n\n\nThe broadcasting rights – covering television, radio, internet and mobile coverage – for the tournament were sold to media companies in each individual territory either directly by FIFA, or through licensed companies or organisations such as the European Broadcasting Union, Organización de Televisión Iberoamericana, International Media Content, Dentsu and RS International Broadcasting & Sports Management.[129] The sale of these rights accounted for an estimated 60% of FIFA's income from staging a World Cup.[130] The International Broadcast Centre was situated at the Riocentro in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro.[131][132]\n\n\nWorldwide, several games qualified as the most-watched sporting events in their country in 2014, including 42.9 million people in Brazil for the opening game between Brazil and Croatia, the 34.1 million in Japan who saw their team play Ivory Coast, and 34.7 million in Germany who saw their national team win the World Cup against Argentina,[133] while the 24.7 million viewers during the game between the US and Portugal is joint with the 2010 final as the most-watched football game in the United States.[134] According to FIFA, over 1 billion people tuned in worldwide to watch the final between Germany and Argentina.[135]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies\n\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup generated various controversies, including demonstrations, some of which took place even before the tournament started. Furthermore, there were various issues with safety, including the death of eight workers and a fire during construction, breaches into stadiums, an unstable makeshift staircase at the Maracanã Stadium, a monorail collapse, and the collapse of an unfinished overpass in Belo Horizonte.[136][137][138][139][140] The houses of thousands of families living in Rio de Janeiro’s slums were cleared for redevelopments for the World Cup in spite of protests and resistance. Favela do Metrô, near the Maracanã Stadium, was completely destroyed as a result, having previously housed 700 families in 2010.[141][142][143]\n\n\n\n### Protests[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anti-World Cup demonstration on the opening day\nFurther information: List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies § Protests\n\nSee also: 2013 protests in Brazil and 2014 protests in Brazil\n\nPrior to the opening ceremony of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup staged in Brazil, demonstrations took place outside the venue, organised by people unhappy with the amount of public money spent to enable the hosting of the FIFA World Cup.[144] Both the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff and FIFA president Sepp Blatter were heavily booed as they were announced to give their speeches at the 2013 tournament's opening,[145] which resulted in FIFA announcing that the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony would not feature any speeches.[146] Further protests took place during the Confederations Cup as well as prior to and during the World Cup.[147][148][149][150][151]\n\n\n\n### Breaches into stadiums[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies § Breaches into stadiums\n\nAt the Group B match between Spain and Chile, around 100 Chilean supporters who had gathered outside Maracanã Stadium forced their way into the stadium and caused damage to the media centre. Military police reported that 85 Chileans were detained during the events, while others reached the stands. Earlier, about 20 Argentinians made a similar breach during Argentina's Group F game against Bosnia and Herzegovina at the same stadium.[152][153]\n\n\n\n### Bridge collapse[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Belo Horizonte overpass collapse\n\nOn 3 July 2014, an overpass under construction in Belo Horizonte as part of the World Cup infrastructure projects collapsed onto a busy carriageway below, leaving two people dead and 22 others injured.[154][155]\n\n\n\n### Head injuries[edit]\n\n\nDuring the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious.[156] The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.[157]\n\n\nSecond, in the Final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup Final.[158]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup\n* FIFA World Cup\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Bosnia and Herzegovina was until 1992 part of Yugoslavia, which competed at eight World Cup tournaments.\n2. **^** The Arena Pernambuco is located in São Lourenço da Mata, Recife.\n3. **^** The spray was trialled at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup, 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup and 2013 FIFA Club World Cup\n4. **^** In 1938's round of 16, two games were also tied after extra-time, but those were replayed instead.\n5. **^** Those matches scheduled to be filmed in ultra high definition were one match from the round of 16 (on 28 June), one quarter-final (on 4 July) and the final\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Players – Top goals\". *FIFA.com*.

It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010. The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations. In 2004, the international football federation, FIFA, selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco to become the first African nation to host the finals.[6]\n\n\nThe matches were played in 10 stadiums in nine host cities around the country,[7] with the opening and final played at the Soccer City stadium in South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg.[8][9] Thirty-two teams were selected for participation[10] via a worldwide qualification tournament that began in August 2007. In the first round of the tournament finals, the teams competed in round-robin groups of four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These 16 teams advanced to the knockout stage, where three rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the final.\n\n\nIn the final, Spain, the European champions, defeated third-time losing finalists the Netherlands 1–0 after extra time to win their first world title. Spain became the eighth nation to win the tournament and the first European nation to win a World Cup hosted outside its home continent: all previous World Cups held outside Europe had been won by South American nations. They are also the first national team since 1978 to win a World Cup after losing a game in the group stage. As a result of their win, Spain represented the World in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Host nation South Africa were eliminated in the group stage and both 2006 World Cup finalists Italy and France were also eliminated at the group stage. It was the first time that the hosts had been eliminated in the first stage. New Zealand, with their three draws, were the only undefeated team in the tournament, but they were also eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts § 2010 FIFA World Cup\n\nAfrica was chosen as the host for the 2010 World Cup as part of a short-lived rotation policy, abandoned in 2007,[11] to rotate the event among football confederations. Five African nations placed bids to host the 2010 World Cup: Egypt, Morocco, South Africa and a joint bid from Libya and Tunisia.\n\n\nFollowing the decision of the FIFA Executive Committee not to allow co-hosted tournaments, Tunisia withdrew from the bidding process. The committee also decided not to consider Libya's solo bid as it no longer met all the stipulations laid down in the official *List of Requirements*.\n\n\nThe winning bid was announced by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at a media conference on 15 May 2004 in Zürich; in the first round of voting, South Africa received 14 votes, Morocco received 10 votes and Egypt no votes. South Africa, which had narrowly failed to win the right to host the 2006 event, was thus awarded the right to host the tournament.[12] Campaigning for South Africa to be granted host status, Nelson Mandela had previously spoken of the importance of football in his life, stating that while incarcerated in Robben Island prison playing football \"made us feel alive and triumphant despite the situation we found ourselves in\".[13] With South Africa winning their bid, an emotional Mandela raised the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[14]\n\n\nDuring 2006 and 2007, rumours circulated in various news sources that the 2010 World Cup could be moved to another country.[15][16] Franz Beckenbauer, Horst R. Schmidt, and, reportedly, some FIFA executives expressed concern over the planning, organisation, and pace of South Africa's preparations.[15][17] FIFA officials repeatedly expressed their confidence in South Africa as host, stating that a contingency plan existed only to cover natural catastrophes, as had been in place at previous FIFA World Cups.[18]\n\n\n\n### Bribery and corruption[edit]\n\n\nOn 28 May 2015, media covering the 2015 FIFA corruption case reported that high-ranking officials from the South African bid committee had secured the right to host the World Cup by paying US$10 million in bribes to then-FIFA Vice President Jack Warner and to other FIFA Executive Committee members.[19]\n\n\nOn 4 June 2015, FIFA executive Chuck Blazer, having co-operated with the FBI and the Swiss authorities, confirmed that he and the other members of FIFA's executive committee were bribed in order to promote the South African 1998 and 2010 World Cup bids. Blazer stated, \"I and others on the FIFA executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup.\"[20][21]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2015, *The Daily Telegraph* reported that Morocco had actually won the vote, but South Africa was awarded the tournament instead.[22]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nThe qualification draw for the 2010 World Cup was held in Durban on 25 November 2007. As the host nation, South Africa qualified automatically for the tournament. As happened in the previous tournament, the defending champions were not given an automatic berth, and Italy had to participate in qualification. With a pool of entrants comprising 204 of the 208 FIFA national teams at the time, the 2010 World Cup shares with the 2008 Summer Olympics the record for most competing nations in a sporting event.\n\n\nSome controversies arose during the qualifications. In the second leg of the play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee, handled the ball in the lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread comment and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the Football Association of Ireland to replay the match,[23] and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant.[24][25] As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of goal-line referee's assistants for the South African tournament.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Supporters watching the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, with vuvuzelas\nCosta Rica complained over Uruguay's winning goal in the CONMEBOL–CONCACAF playoff,[27] while Egypt and Algeria's November 2009 matches were surrounded by reports of crowd trouble.\nOn the subject of fair play, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said:\n\n\n\n\n> I appeal to all the players and coaches to observe this fair play. In 2010 we want to prove that football is more than just kicking a ball but has social and cultural value ... So we ask the players 'please observe fair play' so they will be an example to the rest of the world.[28]\n> \n> \n\n\nSlovakia was making its first appearance as an independent nation but had previously been represented as part of the Czechoslovakia team that had last played in the 1990 tournament; North Korea qualified for the first time since 1966; Honduras and New Zealand were both making their first appearances since 1982; Algeria were at the finals for the first time since the 1986 competition; and Greece qualified for the first time since 1994. Serbia also made its first appearance as an independent nation, having previously been present as Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1930, as SFR Yugoslavia from 1950 to 1990, as FR Yugoslavia in 1998 and as Serbia and Montenegro in 2006.\n\n\nTeams that failed to qualify for this tournament included Saudi Arabia, which had qualified for the previous four tournaments; Tunisia and Croatia, both of whom had qualified for the previous three finals; Costa Rica, Ecuador, Poland and Sweden, who had qualified for the previous two editions; 2006 quarter-finalists Ukraine and Euro 2008 semi-finalists Russia and Turkey. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Croatia (ranked 10th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was North Korea (ranked 105th).\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], this was the last time South Africa, New Zealand, North Korea, Paraguay, Slovakia and Slovenia qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the last time Costa Rica, Iran, Belgium, and Croatia (only time) failed to qualify.\n\n\n\n### List of qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings,[29] qualified for the final tournament.\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AFC (4)* ![](image) Australia (20)\n* ![](image) Japan (45)\n* ![](image) North Korea (105)\n* ![](image) South Korea (47)\n\nCAF (6)* ![](image) Algeria (30)\n* ![](image) Cameroon (19)\n* ![](image) Ghana (32)\n* ![](image) Ivory Coast (27)\n* ![](image) Nigeria (21)\n* ![](image) South Africa (83) (hosts)\n | CONCACAF (3)* ![](image) Honduras (38)\n* ![](image) Mexico (17)\n* ![](image) United States (14)\n\nCONMEBOL (5)* ![](image) Argentina (7)\n* ![](image) Brazil (1)\n* ![](image) Chile (18)\n* ![](image) Paraguay (31)\n* ![](image) Uruguay (16)\n\nOFC (1)* ![](image) New Zealand (78)\n | UEFA (13)* ![](image) Denmark (36)\n* ![](image) England (8)\n* ![](image) France (9)\n* ![](image) Germany (6)\n* ![](image) Greece (13)\n* ![](image) Italy (5)\n* ![](image) Netherlands (4)\n* ![](image) Portugal (3)\n* ![](image) Serbia (15)\n* ![](image) Slovakia (34)\n* ![](image) Slovenia (25)\n* ![](image) Spain (2)\n* ![](image)  Switzerland (24)\n | ![](image)Qualified countries\n Countries that did not qualify\n Countries that did not enter\n Country not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n## Preparations[edit]\n\n\nFive new stadiums were built for the tournament, and five of the existing venues were upgraded. Construction costs were expected to be R8.4 billion (just over US$1 billion or €950 million).[30]\n\n\nSouth Africa also improved its public transport infrastructure within the host cities, including Johannesburg's Gautrain and other metro systems, and major road networks were improved.[31] In March 2009, Danny Jordaan, the president of the 2010 World Cup organising committee, reported that all stadiums for the tournament were on schedule to be completed within six months.[32]\n\n\nThe country implemented special measures to ensure the safety and security of spectators in accordance with standard FIFA requirements,[33] including a temporary restriction of flight operation in the airspace surrounding the stadiums.[34]\n\n\nAt a ceremony to mark 100 days before the event, FIFA president Sepp Blatter praised the readiness of the country for the event.[35]\n\n\n\n### Construction strike[edit]\n\n\nOn 8 July 2009, 70,000 construction workers[36] who were working on the new stadiums walked off their jobs.[37] The majority of the workers receive R2500 per month (about £192, €224 or US$313), but the unions alleged that some workers were grossly underpaid. A spokesperson for the National Union of Mineworkers said to the SABC that the \"no work no pay\" strike would go on until FIFA assessed penalties on the organisers. Other unions threatened to strike into 2011.[38][39] The strike was swiftly resolved and workers were back at work within a week of it starting. There were no further strikes and all stadiums and construction projects were completed in time for the kick off.[40]\n\n\n\n## Prize money[edit]\n\n\nThe total prize money on offer for the tournament was confirmed by FIFA as US$420 million (including payments of US$40 million to domestic clubs), a 60 percent increase on the 2006 tournament.[41] Before the tournament, each of the 32 entrants received US$1 million for preparation costs. Once at the tournament, the prize money was distributed as follows:[41]\n\n\n\n* US$8 million – To each team eliminated at the group stage (16 teams) ($11.18 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$9 million – To each team eliminated in the round of 16 (8 teams) ($12.58 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$14 million – To each team eliminated in the quarter-finals (4 teams) ($19.56 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$18 million – Fourth placed team ($25.15 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$20 million – Third placed team ($27.94 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$24 million – Runner up ($33.53 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$30 million – Winner ($41.92 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n\n\nIn a first for the World Cup, FIFA made payments to the domestic clubs of the players representing their national teams at the tournament. This saw a total of US$40 million paid to domestic clubs. This was the result of an agreement reached in 2008 between FIFA and European clubs to disband the G-14 group and drop their claims for compensation dating back to 2005 over the financial cost of injuries sustained to their players while on international duty, such as that from Belgian club Charleroi S.C. for injury to Morocco's Abdelmajid Oulmers in a friendly game in 2004, and from English club Newcastle United for an injury to England's Michael Owen in the 2006 World Cup.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nIn 2005, the organisers released a provisional list of 13 venues to be used for the World Cup: Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg (two venues), Kimberley, Klerksdorp, Nelspruit, Orkney, Polokwane, Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, and Rustenburg. This was narrowed down to the ten venues[46] that were officially announced by FIFA on 17 March 2006.\n\n\nThe altitude of several venues affected the motion of the ball[47] and player performance,[48][49] although FIFA's medical chief downplayed this consideration.[50] Six of the ten venues were over 1,200 m (3,900 ft) above sea level, with the two Johannesburg venues—FNB Stadium (also known as Soccer City) and Ellis Park Stadium—the highest at approximately 1,750 m (5,740 ft).[51][52]\n\n\nFNB Stadium, Cape Town Stadium, and Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth were the most-used venues, each hosting eight matches. Ellis Park Stadium and Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban hosted seven matches each, while Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein and Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg hosted six matches each. Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane and Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit hosted four matches each, but did not host any knockout-stage matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) South Africa |\n| --- |\n| Johannesburg | Cape Town | Durban |\n| FNB Stadium[53] **(Soccer City)** | Ellis Park Stadium | Cape Town Stadium **(Green Point Stadium)** | Moses Mabhida Stadium **(Durban Stadium)** |\n| 26°14′5.27″S 27°58′56.47″E﻿ / ﻿26.2347972°S 27.9823528°E﻿ / -26.2347972; 27.9823528﻿ (Soccer City) | 26°11′51.07″S 28°3′38.76″E﻿ / ﻿26.1975194°S 28.0607667°E﻿ / -26.1975194; 28.0607667﻿ (Ellis Park Stadium) | 33°54′12.46″S 18°24′40.15″E﻿ / ﻿33.9034611°S 18.4111528°E﻿ / -33.9034611; 18.4111528﻿ (Cape Town Stadium) | 29°49′46″S 31°01′49″E﻿ / ﻿29.82944°S 31.03028°E﻿ / -29.82944; 31.03028﻿ (Moses Mabhida Stadium) |\n| Capacity: **84,490** | Capacity: **55,686** | Capacity: **64,100** | Capacity: **62,760** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Pretoria | ![2010 FIFA World Cup is located in South Africa](image)![Johannesburg](image)\nJohannesburg\n![Durban](image)\nDurban\n![Cape Town](image)\nCape Town\n![    Pretoria](image)\nPretoria\n![Port Elizabeth](image)\nPort Elizabeth\n![Bloemfontein](image)\nBloemfontein\n![Polokwane](image)\nPolokwane\n![Rustenburg](image)\nRustenburg\n![    Nelspruit](image)\nNelspruit\n2010 FIFA World Cup (South Africa)\n |\n| Loftus Versfeld Stadium |\n| 25°45′12″S 28°13′22″E﻿ / ﻿25.75333°S 28.22278°E﻿ / -25.75333; 28.22278﻿ (Loftus Versfeld Stadium) |\n| Capacity: **42,858** |\n| ![](image) |\n| Port Elizabeth | Stadiums in Johannesburg![2010 FIFA World Cup is located in Greater Johannesburg](image)![Soccer City](image)\nSoccer City\n![Ellis Park](image)\nEllis Park\n |\n| Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium |\n| 33°56′16″S 25°35′56″E﻿ / ﻿33.93778°S 25.59889°E﻿ / -33.93778; 25.59889﻿ (Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium) |\n| Capacity: **42,486** |\n| ![](image) |\n| Rustenburg | Polokwane | Nelspruit | Bloemfontein |\n| 25°34′43″S 27°09′39″E﻿ / ﻿25.5786°S 27.1607°E﻿ / -25.5786; 27.1607﻿ (Royal Bafokeng Stadium) | 23°55′29″S 29°28′08″E﻿ / ﻿23.924689°S 29.468765°E﻿ / -23.924689; 29.468765﻿ (Peter Mokaba Stadium) | 25°27′42″S 30°55′47″E﻿ / ﻿25.46172°S 30.929689°E﻿ / -25.46172; 30.929689﻿ (Mbombela Stadium) | 29°07′02.25″S 26°12′31.85″E﻿ / ﻿29.1172917°S 26.2088472°E﻿ / -29.1172917; 26.2088472﻿ (Free State Stadium) |\n| Royal Bafokeng Stadium | Peter Mokaba Stadium | Mbombela Stadium | Free State Stadium |\n| Capacity: **42,000** | Capacity: **41,733** | Capacity: **40,929** | Capacity: **40,911** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\nThe following stadiums were all upgraded to meet FIFA specifications:\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Cecil Payne Stadium[54]\n* Dobsonville Stadium[54]\n* Gelvandale Stadium[55]\n* Giant Stadium[56]\n* HM Pitje Stadium[56]\n | * King Zwelithini Stadium\n* Olympia Park Stadium\n* Orlando Stadium[54]\n* Princess Magogo Stadium\n* Rabie Ridge Stadium[54]\n | * Rand Stadium[54]\n* Ruimsig Stadium[54]\n* Seisa Ramabodu Stadium[57]\n* Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium\n* Super Stadium[56]\n\n\n |\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nThe base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.

Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad by 1 June 2010. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.[66]\n\n\nOf the 736 players participating in the tournament, over half played their club football in five European domestic leagues; those in England (117 players), Germany (84), Italy (80), Spain (59) and France (46).[67] The English, German and Italian squads were made up of entirely home based players, while only Nigeria had no players from clubs in their own league. In all, players from 52 national leagues entered the tournament. FC Barcelona of Spain was the club contributing the most players to the tournament, with 13 players of their side travelling, 7 with the Spanish team, while another 7 clubs contributed 10 players or more.\n\n\nIn another first for South Africa 2010, one squad included three siblings. Jerry, Johnny, and Wilson Palacios made history thanks to their inclusion in Honduras's 23-man list.[68] Unusually, the game between Germany and Ghana had two brothers playing for opposite nations, with Jérôme Boateng and Kevin-Prince Boateng playing respectively.\n\n\n\n## Match summary[edit]\n\n\nThe 32 national teams involved in the tournament together played a total of 64 matches starting from the group stage matches and progressing to the knockout stage matches, with teams eliminated through the various progressive stages. Rest days were allocated during the various stages to allow players recovery during the tournament. Preliminary events were also held in celebration of the World Cup event.[69] All times listed in the table below are in South African Standard Time (UTC+02).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Day | Time | Venue | Stage |

group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.\n\n\nThe South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.\n\n\nOf the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]\n\n\nOnly six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986. Nonetheless, the final was contested by two European teams.[68] In another World Cup first, the two finalists from the preceding tournament, Italy and France, were eliminated at the group stage, with Italy becoming the third defending champions to be eliminated in the first round after Brazil in 1966 and France in 2002.[76] New Zealand, one of the lowest-ranked teams, surprised many by drawing all three of their group matches, ending the tournament as the only undefeated team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tie-breaking criteria for group play\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams were ranked on the following criteria:[77]\n1. Greater number of points in all group matches\n2. Goal difference in all group matches\n3. Greater number of goals scored in all group matches\n4. Greatest number of points in matches between tied teams\n5. Goal difference in matches between tied teams\n6. Greatest number of goals scored in matches between tied teams\n7.

There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes of extra time; if scores were still level, there was a penalty shoot-out to determine who progressed to the next round.[82]\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Round of 16 |  | Quarter-finals |  | Semi-finals |  | Final |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 26 June – Port Elizabeth |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | **![](image) Uruguay** | **2** |\n|  | 2 July – Johannesburg (Soccer City) |\n|  | ![](image) South Korea | 1\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Uruguay** (p) | **1 (4)** |\n|  | 26 June – Rustenburg |\n|  |  | ![](image) Ghana | 1 (2)\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) United States | 1 |\n|  |  | 6 July – Cape Town |\n|  | **![](image) Ghana** (a.e.t.) | **2** |  |\n|  | ![](image) Uruguay | 2 |\n|  | 28 June – Durban |\n|  |  | **![](image) Netherlands** | **3** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Netherlands** | **2** |\n|  | 2 July – Port Elizabeth |  |\n|  | ![](image) Slovakia | 1\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Netherlands** | **2** |\n|  | 28 June – Johannesburg (Ellis Park) |\n|  |  | ![](image) Brazil | 1\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Brazil** | **3** |\n|  |  | 11 July – Johannesburg (Soccer City) |\n|  | ![](image) Chile | 0\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Netherlands | 0 |\n|  | 27 June – Johannesburg (Soccer City) |\n|  |  | **![](image) Spain** (a.e.t.) | **1** |\n|  | **![](image) Argentina** | **3** |\n|  | 3 July – Cape Town |  |\n|  | ![](image) Mexico | 1\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Argentina | 0 |\n|  | 27 June – Bloemfontein |\n|  |  | **![](image) Germany** | **4** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Germany** | **4** |\n|  |  | 7 July – Durban |\n|  | ![](image) England | 1\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Germany | 0 |\n|  | 29 June – Pretoria |\n|  |  | **![](image) Spain** | **1** |  | Third place play-off |\n|  | **![](image) Paraguay** (p) | **0 (5)** |\n|  | 3 July – Johannesburg (Ellis Park) |  | 10 July – Port Elizabeth |\n|  | ![](image) Japan | 0 (3)\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Paraguay | 0 | ![](image) Uruguay | 2 |\n|  | 29 June – Cape Town |\n|  |  | **![](image) Spain** | **1** |  | **![](image) Germany** | **3** |\n|  | **![](image) Spain** | **1** |\n|  |  |  |\n|  | ![](image) Portugal | 0\n |  |\n|  |\n\n\n### Round of 16[edit]\n\n\nIn this round, each group winner (A to H) was paired against the runner-up from another group.\n\n\n\n* South American teams again performed strongly in the round of 16, with four teams advancing to the quarter-finals including Brazil who defeated fellow South Americans Chile.\n* European teams performed even more strongly in the sense that all matches between a European and a non-European team were won by the European team. In the previous edition (2006), they had also achieved this.\n* England's 4–1 loss to Germany was their biggest ever margin of defeat at a World Cup finals.[83][84] It was also the first time that a World Cup finals match between these two traditional rivals had a decisive result in regulation time, their three previous meetings all being tied at 90 minutes, with two settled in extra time and one in a penalty shoot-out.\n* Ghana defeated the United States after extra time to become the third African team to reach the last eight (after Cameroon in 1990 and Senegal in 2002), and the only African team to have achieved both a top 8 finish and a separate top 16 finish (in 2006).\n* Paraguay and Ghana reached the quarter-finals for the first time.\n\n\nThe round was marked by some controversial referees' decisions, including:\n\n\n\n* A disallowed goal by England in their 4–1 loss against Germany, where the shot by Frank Lampard was seen to cross substantially over the goal line when shown on television broadcast replays.\n* An allowed goal by Argentina in their 3–1 win over Mexico, where Argentine striker Carlos Tevez was seen to be offside when shown on television broadcast replays, which were shown inside the stadium shortly after the incident.\n\n\nFIFA President Sepp Blatter took the unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the decisions that went against them, saying: \"Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees' mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it.\"[85] Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: \"We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting.\"[85] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.[85]\n\n\n\n26 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| Uruguay ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Suárez ![](image) 8', 80'\n | Report | * Lee Chung-yong ![](image) 68'\n |\n\nNelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth\nAttendance: 30,597\nReferee: Wolfgang Stark (Germany)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n26 June 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| United States ![](image) | 1–2 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Ghana |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Donovan ![](image) 62' (pen.)\n | Report | * Boateng ![](image) 5'\n* Gyan ![](image) 93'\n |\n\nRoyal Bafokeng Stadium, Rustenburg\nAttendance: 34,976\nReferee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 4–1 | ![](image) England |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Klose ![](image) 20'\n* Podolski ![](image) 32'\n* Müller ![](image) 67', 70'\n | Report | * Upson ![](image) 37'\n |\n\nFree State Stadium, Bloemfontein\nAttendance: 40,510\nReferee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Argentina ![](image) | 3–1 | ![](image) Mexico |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Tevez ![](image) 26', 52'\n* Higuaín ![](image) 33'\n | Report | * Hernández ![](image) 71'\n |\n\nSoccer City, Johannesburg\nAttendance: 84,377\nReferee: Roberto Rosetti (Italy)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n28 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| Netherlands ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Slovakia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Robben ![](image) 18'\n* Sneijder ![](image) 84'\n | Report | * Vittek ![](image) 90+4' (pen.)\n |\n\nMoses Mabhida Stadium, Durban\nAttendance: 61,962\nReferee: Alberto Undiano Mallenco (Spain)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n28 June 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 3–0 | ![](image) Chile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Juan ![](image) 34'\n* Luís Fabiano ![](image) 38'\n* Robinho ![](image) 59'\n | Report |  |\n\nEllis Park Stadium, Johannesburg\nAttendance: 54,096\nReferee: Howard Webb (England)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n29 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| Paraguay ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Japan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Barreto ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Barrios ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Riveros ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Valdez ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Cardozo ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 5–3 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Endō\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Hasebe\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Komano\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Honda\n |\n\nLoftus Versfeld Stadium, Pretoria\nAttendance: 36,742\nReferee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n29 June 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Spain ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Villa ![](image) 63'\n | Report |  |\n\nCape Town Stadium, Cape Town\nAttendance: 62,955\nReferee: Héctor Baldassi (Argentina)\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\nThe three quarter-finals between European and South American teams all resulted in wins for Europeans. Germany had a 4–0 victory over Argentina, and the Netherlands came from behind to beat Brazil 2–1, handing the Brazilians their first loss in a World Cup match held outside Europe (other than in a penalty shoot-out) since 1950 when Uruguay won the decisive match 2–1.[86] Spain reached the final four for the first time since 1950 after a 1–0 win over Paraguay. Uruguay, the only South American team to reach the semi-finals, overcame Ghana in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw in which Ghana missed a penalty at the end of extra time after Luis Suárez controversially handled the ball on the line.\n\n\n\n2 July 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| Netherlands ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Sneijder ![](image) 53', 68'\n | Report | * Robinho ![](image) 10'\n |\n\nNelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth\nAttendance: 40,186\nReferee: Yuichi Nishimura (Japan)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n2 July 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Uruguay ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Ghana |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Forlán ![](image) 55'\n | Report | * Muntari ![](image) 45+2'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Forlán ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Victorino ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Scotti ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* M.

Spain defeated the Netherlands 1–0, with an extra time goal from Andrés Iniesta. Iniesta scored the latest winning goal in a FIFA World Cup final (116th minute).[88] The win gave Spain their first World Cup title, becoming the eighth team to win it. This made them the first new winner without home advantage since Brazil in 1958,[89] and the first team to win the tournament after having lost their opening game.[68]\n\n\nA large number of fouls were committed in the final match. Referee Howard Webb handed out 14 yellow cards, more than doubling the previous record for this fixture, set when Argentina and West Germany shared six cards in 1986,[68] and John Heitinga of the Netherlands was sent off for receiving a second yellow card. The Netherlands had chances to score, most notably in the 60th minute when Arjen Robben was released by Wesley Sneijder to be one-on-one with Spain's goalkeeper Iker Casillas, only for Casillas to save the shot with an outstretched leg. For Spain, Sergio Ramos missed a free header from a corner kick when he was unmarked.[90] Iniesta finally broke the deadlock in extra time, scoring a volleyed shot from a pass by Cesc Fàbregas.[91]\n\n\nThis result marked the first time that two teams from the same continent had won successive World Cups (following Italy in 2006), and saw Europe reaching 10 World Cup titles, surpassing South America's nine titles. Spain became the first team since West Germany in 1974 to win the World Cup as European champions. The result also marked the first time that a European nation had won a World Cup Finals that was not hosted on European soil.\n\n\nA closing ceremony was held before the final, featuring singer Shakira. Afterwards, the former South African President Nelson Mandela made a brief appearance on the pitch, wheeled in by a motorcart.[72][92]\n\n\n\n11 July 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Netherlands ![](image) | 0–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Spain |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Iniesta ![](image) 116'\n |\n\nSoccer City, Johannesburg\nAttendance: 84,490\nReferee: Howard Webb (England)[87]\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Goalscorers[edit]\n\n\nSouth African winger Siphiwe Tshabalala was the first player to score a goal in the competition, in their 1–1 draw against Mexico, the opening game of the tournament. Danish defender Daniel Agger was credited with the first own goal of the tournament, in his side's 2–0 loss to the Netherlands. Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuaín was the only player to score a hat-trick in the tournament, in Argentina's 4–1 win over South Korea, the match where the second and last own goal was scored.[93] It was the 49th World Cup hat-trick in the history of the tournament.\n\n\nSpain set a new record for the fewest goals scored by a World Cup-winning team, with eight.[90] The previous record low was 11, set by Brazil in 1994, England in 1966,[90] and Italy in 1938.[94] Spain had the fewest goalscorers for a champion as well (three – Villa with five goals, Iniesta with two and Puyol with one).[68] They also had the fewest goals conceded for a champion (2), equal with Italy (2006) and France (1998). Spain's victory marked the first time that a team won the World Cup without conceding a goal in the knockout stage.[88]\n\n\nThe four top scorers in the tournament had five goals each. All of the four top scorers also came from the teams that finished in the top four, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, and Uruguay. The Golden Boot went to Thomas Müller of Germany who had three assists, compared to one for the three others. The Silver Boot went to David Villa of Spain, who played a total of 635 minutes, and the Bronze Boot to Wesley Sneijder of the Netherlands, who played 652 minutes. Diego Forlán of Uruguay had five goals and one assist in 654 minutes. A further three players scored four goals.[95]\n\n\nOnly 145 goals were scored at South Africa 2010, the lowest of any FIFA World Cup since the tournament switched to a 64-game format. This continued a downward trend since the first 64-game finals were held 12 years earlier, with 171 goals at France 1998, 161 at Korea/Japan 2002 and 147 at Germany 2006.[68]\n\n\n**5 goals**\n\n\n\n* ![Germany](image) Thomas Müller\n* ![Netherlands](image) Wesley Sneijder\n* ![Spain](image) David Villa\n* ![Uruguay](image) Diego Forlán\n\n**4 goals**\n\n\n\n* ![Argentina](image) Gonzalo Higuaín\n* ![Germany](image) Miroslav Klose\n* ![Slovakia](image) Róbert Vittek\n\n**3 goals**\n\n\n\n* ![Brazil](image) Luís Fabiano\n* ![Ghana](image) Asamoah Gyan\n* ![United States](image) Landon Donovan\n* ![Uruguay](image) Luis Suárez\n\n**2 goals**\n\n\n\n* ![Argentina](image) Carlos Tevez\n* ![Australia](image) Brett Holman\n* ![Brazil](image) Elano\n* ![Brazil](image) Robinho\n* ![Cameroon](image) Samuel Eto'o\n* ![Germany](image) Lukas Podolski\n* ![Japan](image) Keisuke Honda\n* ![Mexico](image) Javier Hernández\n* ![Netherlands](image) Arjen Robben\n* ![Nigeria](image) Kalu Uche\n* ![Portugal](image) Tiago\n* ![South Korea](image) Lee Chung-yong\n* ![South Korea](image) Lee Jung-soo\n* ![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta\n\n**1 goal**\n\n\n\n* ![Argentina](image) Martín Demichelis\n* ![Argentina](image) Gabriel Heinze\n* ![Argentina](image) Martín Palermo\n* ![Australia](image) Tim Cahill\n* ![Brazil](image) Juan\n* ![Brazil](image) Maicon\n* ![Chile](image) Jean Beausejour\n* ![Chile](image) Mark González\n* ![Chile](image) Rodrigo Millar\n* ![Denmark](image) Nicklas Bendtner\n* ![Denmark](image) Dennis Rommedahl\n* ![Denmark](image) Jon Dahl Tomasson\n* ![England](image) Jermain Defoe\n* ![England](image) Steven Gerrard\n* ![England](image) Matthew Upson\n* ![France](image) Florent Malouda\n* ![Germany](image) Cacau\n* ![Germany](image) Arne Friedrich\n* ![Germany](image) Marcell Jansen\n* ![Germany](image) Sami Khedira\n* ![Germany](image) Mesut Özil\n* ![Ghana](image) Kevin-Prince Boateng\n* ![Ghana](image) Sulley Muntari\n* ![Greece](image) Dimitris Salpingidis\n* ![Greece](image) Vasilis Torosidis\n* ![Italy](image) Daniele De Rossi\n* ![Italy](image) Antonio Di Natale\n* ![Italy](image) Vincenzo Iaquinta\n* ![Italy](image) Fabio Quagliarella\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Didier Drogba\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Salomon Kalou\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Romaric\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Yaya Touré\n* ![Japan](image) Yasuhito Endō\n* ![Japan](image) Shinji Okazaki\n* ![Mexico](image) Cuauhtémoc Blanco\n* ![Mexico](image) Rafael Márquez\n* ![Netherlands](image) Klaas-Jan Huntelaar\n* ![Netherlands](image) Dirk Kuyt\n* ![Netherlands](image) Giovanni van Bronckhorst\n* ![Netherlands](image) Robin van Persie\n* ![New Zealand](image) Winston Reid\n* ![New Zealand](image) Shane Smeltz\n* ![Nigeria](image) Yakubu\n* ![North Korea](image) Ji Yun-nam\n* ![Paraguay](image) Antolín Alcaraz\n* ![Paraguay](image) Cristian Riveros\n* ![Paraguay](image) Enrique Vera\n* ![Portugal](image) Hugo Almeida\n* ![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo\n* ![Portugal](image) Liédson\n* ![Portugal](image) Raul Meireles\n* ![Portugal](image) Simão\n* ![Serbia](image) Milan Jovanović\n* ![Serbia](image) Marko Pantelić\n* ![Slovakia](image) Kamil Kopúnek\n* ![Slovenia](image) Valter Birsa\n* ![Slovenia](image) Robert Koren\n* ![Slovenia](image) Zlatan Ljubijankić\n* ![South Africa](image) Bongani Khumalo\n* ![South Africa](image) Katlego Mphela\n* ![South Africa](image) Siphiwe Tshabalala\n* ![South Korea](image) Park Chu-young\n* ![South Korea](image) Park Ji-sung\n* ![Spain](image) Carles Puyol\n* ![Switzerland](image) Gelson Fernandes\n* ![United States](image) Michael Bradley\n* ![United States](image) Clint Dempsey\n* ![Uruguay](image) Edinson Cavani\n* ![Uruguay](image) Álvaro Pereira\n* ![Uruguay](image) Maxi Pereira\n\n**1 own goal**\n\n\n\n* ![Denmark](image) Daniel Agger (against Netherlands)\n* ![South Korea](image) Park Chu-young (against Argentina)\n\n### Discipline[edit]\n\n\n28 players were suspended after being shown two consecutive yellow cards (13 players), a single red card (8 players), or a yellow card followed by a red card (7 players).\n\n\n\n### Final standings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Champion\n Runner-up\n | Third place\n Fourth place\n | Quarter-finals\n Round of 16\n | Group stage\n |\n\nShortly after the final, FIFA issued a final ranking of every team in the tournament.

People were invited to select a team (in a 4–4–2 formation) and best coach; voting was open until 23:59 on 11 July 2010,[100] with entrants going into a draw to win a prize.\n\n\nSix of the eleven players came from the Spanish team, as did the coach. The remainder of the team comprised two players from Germany, and one each from Brazil, the Netherlands and Uruguay.[101][102]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Goalkeeper\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forwards\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Spain](image) Iker Casillas\n | ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm ![Spain](image) Sergio Ramos![Spain](image) Carles Puyol![Brazil](image) Maicon\n | ![Spain](image) Xavi![Germany](image) Bastian Schweinsteiger![Netherlands](image) Wesley Sneijder![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta\n | ![Spain](image) David Villa![Uruguay](image) Diego Forlán\n |\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Spain shirt from 2014, autographed by members of the 2010 World Cup-winning squad, on display in Madrid\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe sponsors of the 2010 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.[103][104][105][106]\n\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA partners | FIFA World Cup sponsors | National supporters\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[107][108]\n* Coca-Cola[109][110]\n* Emirates[111]\n* Hyundai–Kia[112][113]\n* Sony[114]\n* Visa[115]\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Budweiser[116][117]\n* Castrol[118]\n* Continental[119][120]\n* Mahindra Satyam[121][122]\n* McDonald's[123]\n | * MTN Group[124]\n* Seara Foods[125]\n* Yingli Solar[126][127]\n\n\n |\n | * BP South Africa[128]\n* Aggreko[129]\n* First National Bank[130]\n* Neo Africa[131]\n* Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa\n* Telkom[132]\n |\n\n\n### Vuvuzelas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vuvuzela\n![](image)A man sounding a vuvuzelaThe 2010 finals amplified international public awareness of the vuvuzela, a long horn blown by fans throughout matches.[133][134][135][136] Many World Cup competitors complained about the noise caused by the vuvuzela horns, including France's Patrice Evra, who blamed the horns for the team's poor performance.[137] Other critics include Lionel Messi, who complained that the sound of the vuvuzelas hampered communication among players on the pitch,[138] and broadcasting companies, which complained that commentators' voices were drowned out by the sound.[139]\n\n\nOthers watching on television complained that the ambient audio feed from the stadium contained only the sounds of the vuvuzelas with the usual sounds of people in the stands drowned out.[140][141] A spokesperson for ESPN and other networks said that they were taking steps to minimise the ambient noise on their broadcasts.[142] The BBC also investigated the possibility of offering broadcasts without vuvuzela noise.[143]\n\n\n\n## Symbols[edit]\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Zakumi\n\nThe official mascot for the 2010 World Cup was *Zakumi*, an anthropomorphised African leopard with green hair, presented on 22 September 2008. His name came from \"ZA\" (the international abbreviation for South Africa) and the term *kumi*, which means \"ten\" in various African languages.[144] The mascot's colours reflected those of the host nation's playing strip – yellow and green.\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Jabulani\n\nThe match ball for the 2010 World Cup, manufactured by Adidas, was named the *Jabulani*, which means *\"bringing joy to everyone\"* in Zulu. It was the 11th World Cup match ball made by the German sports equipment maker; it featured 11 colours, representing each player of a team on the pitch and the 11 official languages of South Africa.[145][146] A special match ball with gold panels, called the *Jo'bulani*, was used at the final in Johannesburg.\n\n\nThe ball was constructed using a new design, consisting of eight thermally bonded, three-dimensional panels. These were spherically moulded from ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). The surface of the ball was textured with grooves, a technology developed by Adidas called GripnGroove[147] that was intended to improve the ball's aerodynamics. The design received considerable academic input, being developed in partnership with researchers from Loughborough University, United Kingdom.[148] The balls were made in China, using latex bladders made in India, thermoplastic polyurethane-elastomer from Taiwan, ethylene vinyl acetate, isotropic polyester/cotton fabric, and glue and ink from China.[149]\n\n\nSome football stars complained about the new ball, arguing that its movements were difficult to predict.[150] Brazilian goalkeeper Júlio César compared it to a \"supermarket\" ball that favored strikers and worked against goalkeepers.[151] Argentinian coach Diego Maradona said: \"We won't see any long passes in this World Cup because the ball doesn't fly straight.\"[152] However, a number of Adidas-sponsored[153][154][155] players responded favourably to the ball.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Listen Up! The Official 2010 FIFA World Cup Album\n\nThe official song of the 2010 World Cup \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\", was performed by the Colombian singer Shakira and the band Freshlyground from South Africa, and is sung in both English and Spanish.[156] The song is based on a traditional African soldiers' song, \"Zangalewa\".[157] Shakira and Freshlyground performed the song at the pre-tournament concert in Soweto on 10 June. It was also sung at the opening ceremony on 11 June and at the closing ceremony on 11 July.\n\n\nThe official mascot song of the 2010 World Cup was \"Game On\".\n\n\nThe official anthem of the 2010 World Cup was \"Sign of a Victory\" by R. Kelly with the Soweto Spiritual Singers, which was also performed at the opening ceremony.\n\n\n\n## Event effects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour aeroplane, sponsored by Coca-Cola. (2010)\nMain article: 2010 FIFA World Cup event effects\n\n### Social[edit]\n\n\nTournament organiser Danny Jordaan dismissed concerns that the attack on the Togo national team which took place in Angola in January 2010 had any relevance to the security arrangements for the World Cup.[158] There were also reports of thefts against visitors to the country for the World Cup. Tourists from China, Portugal, Spain, South Korea, Japan and Colombia had become victims of crime.[159] On 19 June after the match between England and Algeria, a fan was able to break through the FIFA-appointed security staff at Green Point stadium and gain access to the England team dressing room. The breach took place shortly after Prince William and Prince Harry had left the room. The trespasser was then released before he could be handed over to the Police. The Football Association lodged a formal complaint with FIFA and demanded that security be increased.[160]\n\n\n\n#### Resettlement and eviction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A police patrol in Blikkiesdorp, a settlement for the evicted\nAs with many \"hallmark events\" throughout the world,[161] the 2010 FIFA World Cup has been connected to evictions,[162][163][164][165][166] which many claim are meant to 'beautify the city', impress visiting tourists, and hide shackdwellers. On 14 May 2009, the Durban-based shack-dwellers' movement Abahlali baseMjondolo took the KwaZulu-Natal government to court over their controversial Elimination and Prevention of Re-Emergence of Slums Act, meant to eliminate slums in South Africa and put homeless shackdwellers in transit camps in time for the 2010 World Cup.[167][168]\n\n\nAnother prominent controversy surrounding preparations for the World Cup was the N2 Gateway housing project in Cape Town, which planned to remove over 20,000 residents from the Joe Slovo Informal Settlement along the busy N2 Freeway and build rental flats and bond-houses in its place in time for the 2010 World Cup.[169] NGOs, international human rights organisations, and the Anti-Eviction Campaign have publicly criticised the conditions in Blikkiesdorp and said that the camp has been used to accommodate poor families evicted to make way for the 2010 World Cup.[166][170][171][172]\n\n\nHowever some have argued that evictions are ordinarily common in South Africa and that in the lead up to the tournament many evictions were erroneously ascribed to the World Cup.[173]\n\n\n\n### Economy[edit]\n\n\nSome groups experienced complications in regards to scheduled sporting events, advertising, or broadcasting, as FIFA attempted to maximise control of media rights during the Cup. Affected parties included an international rugby union Test match, a South African airline and some TV networks, all of whom were involved in various legal struggles with World Cup organisers.[174][175][176]\n\n\nDuring the tournament, group ticket-holders who did not utilise all their allotted tickets led to some early-round matches having as many as 11,000 unoccupied seats.[177]\n\n\nWhile the event did help to boost the image of South Africa, it turned out to be a major financial disappointment.[178] Construction costs for venues and infrastructure amounted to £3 billion (€3.6 billion), and the government expected that increased tourism would help to offset these costs to the amount of £570 million (€680 million). However, only £323 million (€385 million) were actually taken in as 309,000 foreign fans came to South Africa, well below the expected number of 450,000.[178]\n\n\nLocal vendors were prohibited from selling food and merchandise within a 1.5 kilometre radius of any stadium hosting a World Cup match. For a vendor to operate within the radius, a registration fee of R60,000 (approximately US$7,888 or €6,200) had to be paid to FIFA. This fee was out of most local vendors' reach, as they are simple one-man-operated vendors. This prevented international visitors from experiencing local South African food. Some local vendors felt cheated out of an opportunity for financial gain and spreading South African culture in favour of multinational corporations.[179]\n\n\nFIFA president Sepp Blatter declared the event \"a huge financial success for everybody, for Africa, for South Africa and for FIFA,\" with revenue to FIFA of £2.24 billion (€2 billion).[180]\n\n\n\n### Quality[edit]\n\n\nIn a December 2010 *Quality Progress*, FIFA President Blatter rated South Africa's organisational efforts a nine out of 10 scale, declaring that South Africa could be considered a plan B for all future competitions. The South African Quality Institute (SAQI) assisted in facility construction, event promotion, and organisations. The main issue listed in the article was lack of sufficient public transportation.[181]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n\n![](image)Production set of the FIFA international broadcast centre during the event\nThe 2010 FIFA World Cup was expected to be the most-watched television event in history.[182] Hundreds of broadcasters, representing about 70 countries, transmitted the Cup to a TV audience that FIFA officials expect to exceed a cumulative 26 billion people, an average of approximately 400 million viewers per match. FIFA estimated that around 700 million viewers would watch the World Cup final.[183]\n\n\nNew forms of digital media have also allowed viewers to watch coverage through alternative means. \"With games airing live on cell phones and computers, the World Cup will get more online coverage than any major sporting event yet,\" said Jake Coyle of the Associated Press.[184]\n\n\nIn the United States, ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 averaged a 2.1 rating, 2,288,000 households and 3,261,000 viewers for the 64 World Cup games. The rating was up 31 percent from a 1.6 in 2006, while households increased 32 percent from 1,735,000 and viewers rose from 2,316,000. The increases had been higher while the US remained in the tournament. Through the first 50 games, the rating was up 48 percent, households increased 54 percent and viewers rose 60 percent. Univision averaged 2,624,000 viewers for the tournament, up 17 percent, and 1,625,000 households, an increase of 11 percent.[185] An executive of the Nielsen Company, a leading audience research firm in the US, described the aggregate numbers for both networks' coverage of the match between the United States and Ghana as \"phenomenal\".[186] Live World Cup streaming on ESPN3.com pulled in some of the largest audiences in history, as 7.4 million unique viewers tuned in for matches. In total, ESPN3.com generated 942 million minutes of viewing or more than two hours per unique viewer. All 64 live matches were viewed by an average of 114,000 persons per minute. Most impressive were the numbers for the semi-final between Spain and Germany, which was viewed by 355,000 people per minute, making it ESPN3.com's largest average audience ever.[187]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSony technology was used to film the tournament. 25 of the matches were captured using 3D cameras.[188] Footage was captured in 3D through Sony's proprietary multi-image MPE-200 processors, housed in specially designed 3D outside broadcast trucks.[189] It supplied its flagship HDC-1500 cameras as well as its new HDC-P1 unit, a compact, point-of-view (POV)-type camera with 3, 2/3-inch CCD sensors.[190] The 3D games were produced for FIFA by Host Broadcast Services.[191]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nIn PlayStation Home, Sony released a virtual space based on the 2010 FIFA World Cup in the Japanese version of Home on 3 December 2009. This virtual space is called the \"FevaArena\" and is a virtual stadium of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, featuring different areas for events, a FIFA mini-game, and a shop with FIFA related content.[192]\n\n\nOn 27 April 2010, EA Sports released the official 2010 World Cup video game.[193]\n\n\n\n### FIFA Fan Fest[edit]\n\n\nFIFA expanded the FIFA Fan Fest, hosting in Sydney, Buenos Aires, Berlin, Paris, Rome, Rio de Janeiro, and Mexico City, as well as several venues around South Africa.[194] The Durban Fan Fest was the most popular in South Africa during the tournament followed by the Cape Town Fan Fest.[195]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n* ![flag](image)South Africa portal\n\n\n* July 2010 Kampala attacks, a series of terrorist bombings in Kampala, Uganda, timed to coincide with the final match\n* *Listen Up!

It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010. The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations. In 2004, the international football federation, FIFA, selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco to become the first African nation to host the finals.[6]\n\n\nThe matches were played in 10 stadiums in nine host cities around the country,[7] with the opening and final played at the Soccer City stadium in South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg.[8][9] Thirty-two teams were selected for participation[10] via a worldwide qualification tournament that began in August 2007. In the first round of the tournament finals, the teams competed in round-robin groups of four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These 16 teams advanced to the knockout stage, where three rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the final.\n\n\nIn the final, Spain, the European champions, defeated third-time losing finalists the Netherlands 1–0 after extra time to win their first world title. Spain became the eighth nation to win the tournament and the first European nation to win a World Cup hosted outside its home continent: all previous World Cups held outside Europe had been won by South American nations. They are also the first national team since 1978 to win a World Cup after losing a game in the group stage. As a result of their win, Spain represented the World in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Host nation South Africa were eliminated in the group stage and both 2006 World Cup finalists Italy and France were also eliminated at the group stage. It was the first time that the hosts had been eliminated in the first stage. New Zealand, with their three draws, were the only undefeated team in the tournament, but they were also eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts § 2010 FIFA World Cup\n\nAfrica was chosen as the host for the 2010 World Cup as part of a short-lived rotation policy, abandoned in 2007,[11] to rotate the event among football confederations. Five African nations placed bids to host the 2010 World Cup: Egypt, Morocco, South Africa and a joint bid from Libya and Tunisia.\n\n\nFollowing the decision of the FIFA Executive Committee not to allow co-hosted tournaments, Tunisia withdrew from the bidding process. The committee also decided not to consider Libya's solo bid as it no longer met all the stipulations laid down in the official *List of Requirements*.\n\n\nThe winning bid was announced by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at a media conference on 15 May 2004 in Zürich; in the first round of voting, South Africa received 14 votes, Morocco received 10 votes and Egypt no votes. South Africa, which had narrowly failed to win the right to host the 2006 event, was thus awarded the right to host the tournament.[12] Campaigning for South Africa to be granted host status, Nelson Mandela had previously spoken of the importance of football in his life, stating that while incarcerated in Robben Island prison playing football \"made us feel alive and triumphant despite the situation we found ourselves in\".[13] With South Africa winning their bid, an emotional Mandela raised the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[14]\n\n\nDuring 2006 and 2007, rumours circulated in various news sources that the 2010 World Cup could be moved to another country.[15][16] Franz Beckenbauer, Horst R. Schmidt, and, reportedly, some FIFA executives expressed concern over the planning, organisation, and pace of South Africa's preparations.[15][17] FIFA officials repeatedly expressed their confidence in South Africa as host, stating that a contingency plan existed only to cover natural catastrophes, as had been in place at previous FIFA World Cups.[18]\n\n\n\n### Bribery and corruption[edit]\n\n\nOn 28 May 2015, media covering the 2015 FIFA corruption case reported that high-ranking officials from the South African bid committee had secured the right to host the World Cup by paying US$10 million in bribes to then-FIFA Vice President Jack Warner and to other FIFA Executive Committee members.[19]\n\n\nOn 4 June 2015, FIFA executive Chuck Blazer, having co-operated with the FBI and the Swiss authorities, confirmed that he and the other members of FIFA's executive committee were bribed in order to promote the South African 1998 and 2010 World Cup bids. Blazer stated, \"I and others on the FIFA executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup.\"[20][21]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2015, *The Daily Telegraph* reported that Morocco had actually won the vote, but South Africa was awarded the tournament instead.[22]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nThe qualification draw for the 2010 World Cup was held in Durban on 25 November 2007. As the host nation, South Africa qualified automatically for the tournament. As happened in the previous tournament, the defending champions were not given an automatic berth, and Italy had to participate in qualification. With a pool of entrants comprising 204 of the 208 FIFA national teams at the time, the 2010 World Cup shares with the 2008 Summer Olympics the record for most competing nations in a sporting event.\n\n\nSome controversies arose during the qualifications. In the second leg of the play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee, handled the ball in the lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread comment and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the Football Association of Ireland to replay the match,[23] and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant.[24][25] As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of goal-line referee's assistants for the South African tournament.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Supporters watching the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, with vuvuzelas\nCosta Rica complained over Uruguay's winning goal in the CONMEBOL–CONCACAF playoff,[27] while Egypt and Algeria's November 2009 matches were surrounded by reports of crowd trouble.\nOn the subject of fair play, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said:\n\n\n\n\n> I appeal to all the players and coaches to observe this fair play. In 2010 we want to prove that football is more than just kicking a ball but has social and cultural value ... So we ask the players 'please observe fair play' so they will be an example to the rest of the world.[28]\n> \n> \n\n\nSlovakia was making its first appearance as an independent nation but had previously been represented as part of the Czechoslovakia team that had last played in the 1990 tournament; North Korea qualified for the first time since 1966; Honduras and New Zealand were both making their first appearances since 1982; Algeria were at the finals for the first time since the 1986 competition; and Greece qualified for the first time since 1994. Serbia also made its first appearance as an independent nation, having previously been present as Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1930, as SFR Yugoslavia from 1950 to 1990, as FR Yugoslavia in 1998 and as Serbia and Montenegro in 2006.\n\n\nTeams that failed to qualify for this tournament included Saudi Arabia, which had qualified for the previous four tournaments; Tunisia and Croatia, both of whom had qualified for the previous three finals; Costa Rica, Ecuador, Poland and Sweden, who had qualified for the previous two editions; 2006 quarter-finalists Ukraine and Euro 2008 semi-finalists Russia and Turkey. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Croatia (ranked 10th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was North Korea (ranked 105th).\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], this was the last time South Africa, New Zealand, North Korea, Paraguay, Slovakia and Slovenia qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the last time Costa Rica, Iran, Belgium, and Croatia (only time) failed to qualify.\n\n\n\n### List of qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings,[29] qualified for the final tournament.\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AFC (4)* ![](image) Australia (20)\n* ![](image) Japan (45)\n* ![](image) North Korea (105)\n* ![](image) South Korea (47)\n\nCAF (6)* ![](image) Algeria (30)\n* ![](image) Cameroon (19)\n* ![](image) Ghana (32)\n* ![](image) Ivory Coast (27)\n* ![](image) Nigeria (21)\n* ![](image) South Africa (83) (hosts)\n | CONCACAF (3)* ![](image) Honduras (38)\n* ![](image) Mexico (17)\n* ![](image) United States (14)\n\nCONMEBOL (5)* ![](image) Argentina (7)\n* ![](image) Brazil (1)\n* ![](image) Chile (18)\n* ![](image) Paraguay (31)\n* ![](image) Uruguay (16)\n\nOFC (1)* ![](image) New Zealand (78)\n | UEFA (13)* ![](image) Denmark (36)\n* ![](image) England (8)\n* ![](image) France (9)\n* ![](image) Germany (6)\n* ![](image) Greece (13)\n* ![](image) Italy (5)\n* ![](image) Netherlands (4)\n* ![](image) Portugal (3)\n* ![](image) Serbia (15)\n* ![](image) Slovakia (34)\n* ![](image) Slovenia (25)\n* ![](image) Spain (2)\n* ![](image)  Switzerland (24)\n | ![](image)Qualified countries\n Countries that did not qualify\n Countries that did not enter\n Country not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n## Preparations[edit]\n\n\nFive new stadiums were built for the tournament, and five of the existing venues were upgraded. Construction costs were expected to be R8.4 billion (just over US$1 billion or €950 million).[30]\n\n\nSouth Africa also improved its public transport infrastructure within the host cities, including Johannesburg's Gautrain and other metro systems, and major road networks were improved.[31] In March 2009, Danny Jordaan, the president of the 2010 World Cup organising committee, reported that all stadiums for the tournament were on schedule to be completed within six months.[32]\n\n\nThe country implemented special measures to ensure the safety and security of spectators in accordance with standard FIFA requirements,[33] including a temporary restriction of flight operation in the airspace surrounding the stadiums.[34]\n\n\nAt a ceremony to mark 100 days before the event, FIFA president Sepp Blatter praised the readiness of the country for the event.[35]\n\n\n\n### Construction strike[edit]\n\n\nOn 8 July 2009, 70,000 construction workers[36] who were working on the new stadiums walked off their jobs.[37] The majority of the workers receive R2500 per month (about £192, €224 or US$313), but the unions alleged that some workers were grossly underpaid. A spokesperson for the National Union of Mineworkers said to the SABC that the \"no work no pay\" strike would go on until FIFA assessed penalties on the organisers. Other unions threatened to strike into 2011.[38][39] The strike was swiftly resolved and workers were back at work within a week of it starting. There were no further strikes and all stadiums and construction projects were completed in time for the kick off.[40]\n\n\n\n## Prize money[edit]\n\n\nThe total prize money on offer for the tournament was confirmed by FIFA as US$420 million (including payments of US$40 million to domestic clubs), a 60 percent increase on the 2006 tournament.[41] Before the tournament, each of the 32 entrants received US$1 million for preparation costs. Once at the tournament, the prize money was distributed as follows:[41]\n\n\n\n* US$8 million – To each team eliminated at the group stage (16 teams) ($11.18 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$9 million – To each team eliminated in the round of 16 (8 teams) ($12.58 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$14 million – To each team eliminated in the quarter-finals (4 teams) ($19.56 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$18 million – Fourth placed team ($25.15 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$20 million – Third placed team ($27.94 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$24 million – Runner up ($33.53 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n* US$30 million – Winner ($41.92 million in 2024 US dollars[42])\n\n\nIn a first for the World Cup, FIFA made payments to the domestic clubs of the players representing their national teams at the tournament. This saw a total of US$40 million paid to domestic clubs. This was the result of an agreement reached in 2008 between FIFA and European clubs to disband the G-14 group and drop their claims for compensation dating back to 2005 over the financial cost of injuries sustained to their players while on international duty, such as that from Belgian club Charleroi S.C. for injury to Morocco's Abdelmajid Oulmers in a friendly game in 2004, and from English club Newcastle United for an injury to England's Michael Owen in the 2006 World Cup.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nIn 2005, the organisers released a provisional list of 13 venues to be used for the World Cup: Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg (two venues), Kimberley, Klerksdorp, Nelspruit, Orkney, Polokwane, Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, and Rustenburg. This was narrowed down to the ten venues[46] that were officially announced by FIFA on 17 March 2006.\n\n\nThe altitude of several venues affected the motion of the ball[47] and player performance,[48][49] although FIFA's medical chief downplayed this consideration.[50] Six of the ten venues were over 1,200 m (3,900 ft) above sea level, with the two Johannesburg venues—FNB Stadium (also known as Soccer City) and Ellis Park Stadium—the highest at approximately 1,750 m (5,740 ft).[51][52]\n\n\nFNB Stadium, Cape Town Stadium, and Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth were the most-used venues, each hosting eight matches. Ellis Park Stadium and Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban hosted seven matches each, while Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein and Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg hosted six matches each. Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane and Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit hosted four matches each, but did not host any knockout-stage matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) South Africa |\n| --- |\n| Johannesburg | Cape Town | Durban |\n| FNB Stadium[53] **(Soccer City)** | Ellis Park Stadium | Cape Town Stadium **(Green Point Stadium)** | Moses Mabhida Stadium **(Durban Stadium)** |\n| 26°14′5.27″S 27°58′56.47″E﻿ / ﻿26.2347972°S 27.9823528°E﻿ / -26.2347972; 27.9823528﻿ (Soccer City) | 26°11′51.07″S 28°3′38.76″E﻿ / ﻿26.1975194°S 28.0607667°E﻿ / -26.1975194; 28.0607667﻿ (Ellis Park Stadium) | 33°54′12.46″S 18°24′40.15″E﻿ / ﻿33.9034611°S 18.4111528°E﻿ / -33.9034611; 18.4111528﻿ (Cape Town Stadium) | 29°49′46″S 31°01′49″E﻿ / ﻿29.82944°S 31.03028°E﻿ / -29.82944; 31.03028﻿ (Moses Mabhida Stadium) |\n| Capacity: **84,490** | Capacity: **55,686** | Capacity: **64,100** | Capacity: **62,760** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Pretoria | ![2010 FIFA World Cup is located in South Africa](image)![Johannesburg](image)\nJohannesburg\n![Durban](image)\nDurban\n![Cape Town](image)\nCape Town\n![    Pretoria](image)\nPretoria\n![Port Elizabeth](image)\nPort Elizabeth\n![Bloemfontein](image)\nBloemfontein\n![Polokwane](image)\nPolokwane\n![Rustenburg](image)\nRustenburg\n![    Nelspruit](image)\nNelspruit\n2010 FIFA World Cup (South Africa)\n |\n| Loftus Versfeld Stadium |\n| 25°45′12″S 28°13′22″E﻿ / ﻿25.75333°S 28.22278°E﻿ / -25.75333; 28.22278﻿ (Loftus Versfeld Stadium) |\n| Capacity: **42,858** |\n| ![](image) |\n| Port Elizabeth | Stadiums in Johannesburg![2010 FIFA World Cup is located in Greater Johannesburg](image)![Soccer City](image)\nSoccer City\n![Ellis Park](image)\nEllis Park\n |\n| Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium |\n| 33°56′16″S 25°35′56″E﻿ / ﻿33.93778°S 25.59889°E﻿ / -33.93778; 25.59889﻿ (Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium) |\n| Capacity: **42,486** |\n| ![](image) |\n| Rustenburg | Polokwane | Nelspruit | Bloemfontein |\n| 25°34′43″S 27°09′39″E﻿ / ﻿25.5786°S 27.1607°E﻿ / -25.5786; 27.1607﻿ (Royal Bafokeng Stadium) | 23°55′29″S 29°28′08″E﻿ / ﻿23.924689°S 29.468765°E﻿ / -23.924689; 29.468765﻿ (Peter Mokaba Stadium) | 25°27′42″S 30°55′47″E﻿ / ﻿25.46172°S 30.929689°E﻿ / -25.46172; 30.929689﻿ (Mbombela Stadium) | 29°07′02.25″S 26°12′31.85″E﻿ / ﻿29.1172917°S 26.2088472°E﻿ / -29.1172917; 26.2088472﻿ (Free State Stadium) |\n| Royal Bafokeng Stadium | Peter Mokaba Stadium | Mbombela Stadium | Free State Stadium |\n| Capacity: **42,000** | Capacity: **41,733** | Capacity: **40,929** | Capacity: **40,911** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\nThe following stadiums were all upgraded to meet FIFA specifications:\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Cecil Payne Stadium[54]\n* Dobsonville Stadium[54]\n* Gelvandale Stadium[55]\n* Giant Stadium[56]\n* HM Pitje Stadium[56]\n | * King Zwelithini Stadium\n* Olympia Park Stadium\n* Orlando Stadium[54]\n* Princess Magogo Stadium\n* Rabie Ridge Stadium[54]\n | * Rand Stadium[54]\n* Ruimsig Stadium[54]\n* Seisa Ramabodu Stadium[57]\n* Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium\n* Super Stadium[56]\n\n\n |\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nThe base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.

Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad by 1 June 2010. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.[66]\n\n\nOf the 736 players participating in the tournament, over half played their club football in five European domestic leagues; those in England (117 players), Germany (84), Italy (80), Spain (59) and France (46).[67] The English, German and Italian squads were made up of entirely home based players, while only Nigeria had no players from clubs in their own league. In all, players from 52 national leagues entered the tournament. FC Barcelona of Spain was the club contributing the most players to the tournament, with 13 players of their side travelling, 7 with the Spanish team, while another 7 clubs contributed 10 players or more.\n\n\nIn another first for South Africa 2010, one squad included three siblings. Jerry, Johnny, and Wilson Palacios made history thanks to their inclusion in Honduras's 23-man list.[68] Unusually, the game between Germany and Ghana had two brothers playing for opposite nations, with Jérôme Boateng and Kevin-Prince Boateng playing respectively.\n\n\n\n## Match summary[edit]\n\n\nThe 32 national teams involved in the tournament together played a total of 64 matches starting from the group stage matches and progressing to the knockout stage matches, with teams eliminated through the various progressive stages. Rest days were allocated during the various stages to allow players recovery during the tournament. Preliminary events were also held in celebration of the World Cup event.[69] All times listed in the table below are in South African Standard Time (UTC+02).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Day | Time | Venue | Stage |

group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.\n\n\nThe South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.\n\n\nOf the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]\n\n\nOnly six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986. Nonetheless, the final was contested by two European teams.[68] In another World Cup first, the two finalists from the preceding tournament, Italy and France, were eliminated at the group stage, with Italy becoming the third defending champions to be eliminated in the first round after Brazil in 1966 and France in 2002.[76] New Zealand, one of the lowest-ranked teams, surprised many by drawing all three of their group matches, ending the tournament as the only undefeated team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tie-breaking criteria for group play\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams were ranked on the following criteria:[77]\n1. Greater number of points in all group matches\n2. Goal difference in all group matches\n3. Greater number of goals scored in all group matches\n4. Greatest number of points in matches between tied teams\n5. Goal difference in matches between tied teams\n6. Greatest number of goals scored in matches between tied teams\n7. Drawing of lots by the FIFA Organising Committee |\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 FIFA World Cup Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Uruguay | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 4\n | 0\n | +4\n | 7\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Mexico | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 3\n | 2\n | +1\n | 4\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) South Africa (H) | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 3\n | 5\n | −2\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) France | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n | −3\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria  \n(H) Hosts\n\n11 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| South Africa ![](image) | 1–1 | ![](image) Mexico |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tshabalala ![](image) 55' | Report | Márquez ![](image) 79' |\n\nSoccer City, Johannesburg\nAttendance: 84,490\nReferee: Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan)[78]\n\n11 June 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Uruguay ![](image) | 0–0 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nCape Town Stadium, Cape Town\nAttendance: 64,100\nReferee: Yuichi Nishimura (Japan)[78]\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n16 June 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| South Africa ![](image) | 0–3 | ![](image) Uruguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Forlán ![](image) 24', 80' (pen.)\n* Á.

There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes of extra time; if scores were still level, there was a penalty shoot-out to determine who progressed to the next round.[82]\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Round of 16 |  | Quarter-finals |  | Semi-finals |  | Final |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 26 June – Port Elizabeth |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | **![](image) Uruguay** | **2** |\n|  | 2 July – Johannesburg (Soccer City) |\n|  | ![](image) South Korea | 1\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Uruguay** (p) | **1 (4)** |\n|  | 26 June – Rustenburg |\n|  |  | ![](image) Ghana | 1 (2)\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) United States | 1 |\n|  |  | 6 July – Cape Town |\n|  | **![](image) Ghana** (a.e.t.) | **2** |  |\n|  | ![](image) Uruguay | 2 |\n|  | 28 June – Durban |\n|  |  | **![](image) Netherlands** | **3** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Netherlands** | **2** |\n|  | 2 July – Port Elizabeth |  |\n|  | ![](image) Slovakia | 1\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Netherlands** | **2** |\n|  | 28 June – Johannesburg (Ellis Park) |\n|  |  | ![](image) Brazil | 1\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Brazil** | **3** |\n|  |  | 11 July – Johannesburg (Soccer City) |\n|  | ![](image) Chile | 0\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Netherlands | 0 |\n|  | 27 June – Johannesburg (Soccer City) |\n|  |  | **![](image) Spain** (a.e.t.) | **1** |\n|  | **![](image) Argentina** | **3** |\n|  | 3 July – Cape Town |  |\n|  | ![](image) Mexico | 1\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Argentina | 0 |\n|  | 27 June – Bloemfontein |\n|  |  | **![](image) Germany** | **4** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Germany** | **4** |\n|  |  | 7 July – Durban |\n|  | ![](image) England | 1\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Germany | 0 |\n|  | 29 June – Pretoria |\n|  |  | **![](image) Spain** | **1** |  | Third place play-off |\n|  | **![](image) Paraguay** (p) | **0 (5)** |\n|  | 3 July – Johannesburg (Ellis Park) |  | 10 July – Port Elizabeth |\n|  | ![](image) Japan | 0 (3)\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Paraguay | 0 | ![](image) Uruguay | 2 |\n|  | 29 June – Cape Town |\n|  |  | **![](image) Spain** | **1** |  | **![](image) Germany** | **3** |\n|  | **![](image) Spain** | **1** |\n|  |  |  |\n|  | ![](image) Portugal | 0\n |  |\n|  |\n\n\n### Round of 16[edit]\n\n\nIn this round, each group winner (A to H) was paired against the runner-up from another group.\n\n\n\n* South American teams again performed strongly in the round of 16, with four teams advancing to the quarter-finals including Brazil who defeated fellow South Americans Chile.\n* European teams performed even more strongly in the sense that all matches between a European and a non-European team were won by the European team. In the previous edition (2006), they had also achieved this.\n* England's 4–1 loss to Germany was their biggest ever margin of defeat at a World Cup finals.[83][84] It was also the first time that a World Cup finals match between these two traditional rivals had a decisive result in regulation time, their three previous meetings all being tied at 90 minutes, with two settled in extra time and one in a penalty shoot-out.\n* Ghana defeated the United States after extra time to become the third African team to reach the last eight (after Cameroon in 1990 and Senegal in 2002), and the only African team to have achieved both a top 8 finish and a separate top 16 finish (in 2006).\n* Paraguay and Ghana reached the quarter-finals for the first time.\n\n\nThe round was marked by some controversial referees' decisions, including:\n\n\n\n* A disallowed goal by England in their 4–1 loss against Germany, where the shot by Frank Lampard was seen to cross substantially over the goal line when shown on television broadcast replays.\n* An allowed goal by Argentina in their 3–1 win over Mexico, where Argentine striker Carlos Tevez was seen to be offside when shown on television broadcast replays, which were shown inside the stadium shortly after the incident.\n\n\nFIFA President Sepp Blatter took the unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the decisions that went against them, saying: \"Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees' mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it.\"[85] Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: \"We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting.\"[85] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.[85]\n\n\n\n26 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| Uruguay ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Suárez ![](image) 8', 80'\n | Report | * Lee Chung-yong ![](image) 68'\n |\n\nNelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth\nAttendance: 30,597\nReferee: Wolfgang Stark (Germany)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n26 June 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| United States ![](image) | 1–2 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Ghana |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Donovan ![](image) 62' (pen.)\n | Report | * Boateng ![](image) 5'\n* Gyan ![](image) 93'\n |\n\nRoyal Bafokeng Stadium, Rustenburg\nAttendance: 34,976\nReferee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 4–1 | ![](image) England |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Klose ![](image) 20'\n* Podolski ![](image) 32'\n* Müller ![](image) 67', 70'\n | Report | * Upson ![](image) 37'\n |\n\nFree State Stadium, Bloemfontein\nAttendance: 40,510\nReferee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Argentina ![](image) | 3–1 | ![](image) Mexico |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Tevez ![](image) 26', 52'\n* Higuaín ![](image) 33'\n | Report | * Hernández ![](image) 71'\n |\n\nSoccer City, Johannesburg\nAttendance: 84,377\nReferee: Roberto Rosetti (Italy)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n28 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| Netherlands ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Slovakia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Robben ![](image) 18'\n* Sneijder ![](image) 84'\n | Report | * Vittek ![](image) 90+4' (pen.)\n |\n\nMoses Mabhida Stadium, Durban\nAttendance: 61,962\nReferee: Alberto Undiano Mallenco (Spain)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n28 June 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 3–0 | ![](image) Chile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Juan ![](image) 34'\n* Luís Fabiano ![](image) 38'\n* Robinho ![](image) 59'\n | Report |  |\n\nEllis Park Stadium, Johannesburg\nAttendance: 54,096\nReferee: Howard Webb (England)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n29 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| Paraguay ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Japan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Barreto ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Barrios ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Riveros ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Valdez ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Cardozo ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 5–3 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Endō\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Hasebe\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Komano\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Honda\n |\n\nLoftus Versfeld Stadium, Pretoria\nAttendance: 36,742\nReferee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n29 June 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Spain ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Villa ![](image) 63'\n | Report |  |\n\nCape Town Stadium, Cape Town\nAttendance: 62,955\nReferee: Héctor Baldassi (Argentina)\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\nThe three quarter-finals between European and South American teams all resulted in wins for Europeans. Germany had a 4–0 victory over Argentina, and the Netherlands came from behind to beat Brazil 2–1, handing the Brazilians their first loss in a World Cup match held outside Europe (other than in a penalty shoot-out) since 1950 when Uruguay won the decisive match 2–1.[86] Spain reached the final four for the first time since 1950 after a 1–0 win over Paraguay. Uruguay, the only South American team to reach the semi-finals, overcame Ghana in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw in which Ghana missed a penalty at the end of extra time after Luis Suárez controversially handled the ball on the line.\n\n\n\n2 July 2010\n16:00\n\n\n| Netherlands ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Sneijder ![](image) 53', 68'\n | Report | * Robinho ![](image) 10'\n |\n\nNelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth\nAttendance: 40,186\nReferee: Yuichi Nishimura (Japan)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n2 July 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Uruguay ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Ghana |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Forlán ![](image) 55'\n | Report | * Muntari ![](image) 45+2'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Forlán ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Victorino ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Scotti ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* M.

Spain defeated the Netherlands 1–0, with an extra time goal from Andrés Iniesta. Iniesta scored the latest winning goal in a FIFA World Cup final (116th minute).[88] The win gave Spain their first World Cup title, becoming the eighth team to win it. This made them the first new winner without home advantage since Brazil in 1958,[89] and the first team to win the tournament after having lost their opening game.[68]\n\n\nA large number of fouls were committed in the final match. Referee Howard Webb handed out 14 yellow cards, more than doubling the previous record for this fixture, set when Argentina and West Germany shared six cards in 1986,[68] and John Heitinga of the Netherlands was sent off for receiving a second yellow card. The Netherlands had chances to score, most notably in the 60th minute when Arjen Robben was released by Wesley Sneijder to be one-on-one with Spain's goalkeeper Iker Casillas, only for Casillas to save the shot with an outstretched leg. For Spain, Sergio Ramos missed a free header from a corner kick when he was unmarked.[90] Iniesta finally broke the deadlock in extra time, scoring a volleyed shot from a pass by Cesc Fàbregas.[91]\n\n\nThis result marked the first time that two teams from the same continent had won successive World Cups (following Italy in 2006), and saw Europe reaching 10 World Cup titles, surpassing South America's nine titles. Spain became the first team since West Germany in 1974 to win the World Cup as European champions. The result also marked the first time that a European nation had won a World Cup Finals that was not hosted on European soil.\n\n\nA closing ceremony was held before the final, featuring singer Shakira. Afterwards, the former South African President Nelson Mandela made a brief appearance on the pitch, wheeled in by a motorcart.[72][92]\n\n\n\n11 July 2010\n20:30\n\n\n| Netherlands ![](image) | 0–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Spain |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Iniesta ![](image) 116'\n |\n\nSoccer City, Johannesburg\nAttendance: 84,490\nReferee: Howard Webb (England)[87]\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Goalscorers[edit]\n\n\nSouth African winger Siphiwe Tshabalala was the first player to score a goal in the competition, in their 1–1 draw against Mexico, the opening game of the tournament. Danish defender Daniel Agger was credited with the first own goal of the tournament, in his side's 2–0 loss to the Netherlands. Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuaín was the only player to score a hat-trick in the tournament, in Argentina's 4–1 win over South Korea, the match where the second and last own goal was scored.[93] It was the 49th World Cup hat-trick in the history of the tournament.\n\n\nSpain set a new record for the fewest goals scored by a World Cup-winning team, with eight.[90] The previous record low was 11, set by Brazil in 1994, England in 1966,[90] and Italy in 1938.[94] Spain had the fewest goalscorers for a champion as well (three – Villa with five goals, Iniesta with two and Puyol with one).[68] They also had the fewest goals conceded for a champion (2), equal with Italy (2006) and France (1998). Spain's victory marked the first time that a team won the World Cup without conceding a goal in the knockout stage.[88]\n\n\nThe four top scorers in the tournament had five goals each. All of the four top scorers also came from the teams that finished in the top four, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, and Uruguay. The Golden Boot went to Thomas Müller of Germany who had three assists, compared to one for the three others. The Silver Boot went to David Villa of Spain, who played a total of 635 minutes, and the Bronze Boot to Wesley Sneijder of the Netherlands, who played 652 minutes. Diego Forlán of Uruguay had five goals and one assist in 654 minutes. A further three players scored four goals.[95]\n\n\nOnly 145 goals were scored at South Africa 2010, the lowest of any FIFA World Cup since the tournament switched to a 64-game format. This continued a downward trend since the first 64-game finals were held 12 years earlier, with 171 goals at France 1998, 161 at Korea/Japan 2002 and 147 at Germany 2006.[68]\n\n\n**5 goals**\n\n\n\n* ![Germany](image) Thomas Müller\n* ![Netherlands](image) Wesley Sneijder\n* ![Spain](image) David Villa\n* ![Uruguay](image) Diego Forlán\n\n**4 goals**\n\n\n\n* ![Argentina](image) Gonzalo Higuaín\n* ![Germany](image) Miroslav Klose\n* ![Slovakia](image) Róbert Vittek\n\n**3 goals**\n\n\n\n* ![Brazil](image) Luís Fabiano\n* ![Ghana](image) Asamoah Gyan\n* ![United States](image) Landon Donovan\n* ![Uruguay](image) Luis Suárez\n\n**2 goals**\n\n\n\n* ![Argentina](image) Carlos Tevez\n* ![Australia](image) Brett Holman\n* ![Brazil](image) Elano\n* ![Brazil](image) Robinho\n* ![Cameroon](image) Samuel Eto'o\n* ![Germany](image) Lukas Podolski\n* ![Japan](image) Keisuke Honda\n* ![Mexico](image) Javier Hernández\n* ![Netherlands](image) Arjen Robben\n* ![Nigeria](image) Kalu Uche\n* ![Portugal](image) Tiago\n* ![South Korea](image) Lee Chung-yong\n* ![South Korea](image) Lee Jung-soo\n* ![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta\n\n**1 goal**\n\n\n\n* ![Argentina](image) Martín Demichelis\n* ![Argentina](image) Gabriel Heinze\n* ![Argentina](image) Martín Palermo\n* ![Australia](image) Tim Cahill\n* ![Brazil](image) Juan\n* ![Brazil](image) Maicon\n* ![Chile](image) Jean Beausejour\n* ![Chile](image) Mark González\n* ![Chile](image) Rodrigo Millar\n* ![Denmark](image) Nicklas Bendtner\n* ![Denmark](image) Dennis Rommedahl\n* ![Denmark](image) Jon Dahl Tomasson\n* ![England](image) Jermain Defoe\n* ![England](image) Steven Gerrard\n* ![England](image) Matthew Upson\n* ![France](image) Florent Malouda\n* ![Germany](image) Cacau\n* ![Germany](image) Arne Friedrich\n* ![Germany](image) Marcell Jansen\n* ![Germany](image) Sami Khedira\n* ![Germany](image) Mesut Özil\n* ![Ghana](image) Kevin-Prince Boateng\n* ![Ghana](image) Sulley Muntari\n* ![Greece](image) Dimitris Salpingidis\n* ![Greece](image) Vasilis Torosidis\n* ![Italy](image) Daniele De Rossi\n* ![Italy](image) Antonio Di Natale\n* ![Italy](image) Vincenzo Iaquinta\n* ![Italy](image) Fabio Quagliarella\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Didier Drogba\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Salomon Kalou\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Romaric\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Yaya Touré\n* ![Japan](image) Yasuhito Endō\n* ![Japan](image) Shinji Okazaki\n* ![Mexico](image) Cuauhtémoc Blanco\n* ![Mexico](image) Rafael Márquez\n* ![Netherlands](image) Klaas-Jan Huntelaar\n* ![Netherlands](image) Dirk Kuyt\n* ![Netherlands](image) Giovanni van Bronckhorst\n* ![Netherlands](image) Robin van Persie\n* ![New Zealand](image) Winston Reid\n* ![New Zealand](image) Shane Smeltz\n* ![Nigeria](image) Yakubu\n* ![North Korea](image) Ji Yun-nam\n* ![Paraguay](image) Antolín Alcaraz\n* ![Paraguay](image) Cristian Riveros\n* ![Paraguay](image) Enrique Vera\n* ![Portugal](image) Hugo Almeida\n* ![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo\n* ![Portugal](image) Liédson\n* ![Portugal](image) Raul Meireles\n* ![Portugal](image) Simão\n* ![Serbia](image) Milan Jovanović\n* ![Serbia](image) Marko Pantelić\n* ![Slovakia](image) Kamil Kopúnek\n* ![Slovenia](image) Valter Birsa\n* ![Slovenia](image) Robert Koren\n* ![Slovenia](image) Zlatan Ljubijankić\n* ![South Africa](image) Bongani Khumalo\n* ![South Africa](image) Katlego Mphela\n* ![South Africa](image) Siphiwe Tshabalala\n* ![South Korea](image) Park Chu-young\n* ![South Korea](image) Park Ji-sung\n* ![Spain](image) Carles Puyol\n* ![Switzerland](image) Gelson Fernandes\n* ![United States](image) Michael Bradley\n* ![United States](image) Clint Dempsey\n* ![Uruguay](image) Edinson Cavani\n* ![Uruguay](image) Álvaro Pereira\n* ![Uruguay](image) Maxi Pereira\n\n**1 own goal**\n\n\n\n* ![Denmark](image) Daniel Agger (against Netherlands)\n* ![South Korea](image) Park Chu-young (against Argentina)\n\n### Discipline[edit]\n\n\n28 players were suspended after being shown two consecutive yellow cards (13 players), a single red card (8 players), or a yellow card followed by a red card (7 players).\n\n\n\n### Final standings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Champion\n Runner-up\n | Third place\n Fourth place\n | Quarter-finals\n Round of 16\n | Group stage\n |\n\nShortly after the final, FIFA issued a final ranking of every team in the tournament.

People were invited to select a team (in a 4–4–2 formation) and best coach; voting was open until 23:59 on 11 July 2010,[100] with entrants going into a draw to win a prize.\n\n\nSix of the eleven players came from the Spanish team, as did the coach. The remainder of the team comprised two players from Germany, and one each from Brazil, the Netherlands and Uruguay.[101][102]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Goalkeeper\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forwards\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Spain](image) Iker Casillas\n | ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm ![Spain](image) Sergio Ramos![Spain](image) Carles Puyol![Brazil](image) Maicon\n | ![Spain](image) Xavi![Germany](image) Bastian Schweinsteiger![Netherlands](image) Wesley Sneijder![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta\n | ![Spain](image) David Villa![Uruguay](image) Diego Forlán\n |\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Spain shirt from 2014, autographed by members of the 2010 World Cup-winning squad, on display in Madrid\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe sponsors of the 2010 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.[103][104][105][106]\n\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA partners | FIFA World Cup sponsors | National supporters\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[107][108]\n* Coca-Cola[109][110]\n* Emirates[111]\n* Hyundai–Kia[112][113]\n* Sony[114]\n* Visa[115]\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Budweiser[116][117]\n* Castrol[118]\n* Continental[119][120]\n* Mahindra Satyam[121][122]\n* McDonald's[123]\n | * MTN Group[124]\n* Seara Foods[125]\n* Yingli Solar[126][127]\n\n\n |\n | * BP South Africa[128]\n* Aggreko[129]\n* First National Bank[130]\n* Neo Africa[131]\n* Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa\n* Telkom[132]\n |\n\n\n### Vuvuzelas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vuvuzela\n![](image)A man sounding a vuvuzelaThe 2010 finals amplified international public awareness of the vuvuzela, a long horn blown by fans throughout matches.[133][134][135][136] Many World Cup competitors complained about the noise caused by the vuvuzela horns, including France's Patrice Evra, who blamed the horns for the team's poor performance.[137] Other critics include Lionel Messi, who complained that the sound of the vuvuzelas hampered communication among players on the pitch,[138] and broadcasting companies, which complained that commentators' voices were drowned out by the sound.[139]\n\n\nOthers watching on television complained that the ambient audio feed from the stadium contained only the sounds of the vuvuzelas with the usual sounds of people in the stands drowned out.[140][141] A spokesperson for ESPN and other networks said that they were taking steps to minimise the ambient noise on their broadcasts.[142] The BBC also investigated the possibility of offering broadcasts without vuvuzela noise.[143]\n\n\n\n## Symbols[edit]\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Zakumi\n\nThe official mascot for the 2010 World Cup was *Zakumi*, an anthropomorphised African leopard with green hair, presented on 22 September 2008. His name came from \"ZA\" (the international abbreviation for South Africa) and the term *kumi*, which means \"ten\" in various African languages.[144] The mascot's colours reflected those of the host nation's playing strip – yellow and green.\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Jabulani\n\nThe match ball for the 2010 World Cup, manufactured by Adidas, was named the *Jabulani*, which means *\"bringing joy to everyone\"* in Zulu. It was the 11th World Cup match ball made by the German sports equipment maker; it featured 11 colours, representing each player of a team on the pitch and the 11 official languages of South Africa.[145][146] A special match ball with gold panels, called the *Jo'bulani*, was used at the final in Johannesburg.\n\n\nThe ball was constructed using a new design, consisting of eight thermally bonded, three-dimensional panels. These were spherically moulded from ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). The surface of the ball was textured with grooves, a technology developed by Adidas called GripnGroove[147] that was intended to improve the ball's aerodynamics. The design received considerable academic input, being developed in partnership with researchers from Loughborough University, United Kingdom.[148] The balls were made in China, using latex bladders made in India, thermoplastic polyurethane-elastomer from Taiwan, ethylene vinyl acetate, isotropic polyester/cotton fabric, and glue and ink from China.[149]\n\n\nSome football stars complained about the new ball, arguing that its movements were difficult to predict.[150] Brazilian goalkeeper Júlio César compared it to a \"supermarket\" ball that favored strikers and worked against goalkeepers.[151] Argentinian coach Diego Maradona said: \"We won't see any long passes in this World Cup because the ball doesn't fly straight.\"[152] However, a number of Adidas-sponsored[153][154][155] players responded favourably to the ball.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Listen Up! The Official 2010 FIFA World Cup Album\n\nThe official song of the 2010 World Cup \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\", was performed by the Colombian singer Shakira and the band Freshlyground from South Africa, and is sung in both English and Spanish.[156] The song is based on a traditional African soldiers' song, \"Zangalewa\".[157] Shakira and Freshlyground performed the song at the pre-tournament concert in Soweto on 10 June. It was also sung at the opening ceremony on 11 June and at the closing ceremony on 11 July.\n\n\nThe official mascot song of the 2010 World Cup was \"Game On\".\n\n\nThe official anthem of the 2010 World Cup was \"Sign of a Victory\" by R. Kelly with the Soweto Spiritual Singers, which was also performed at the opening ceremony.\n\n\n\n## Event effects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour aeroplane, sponsored by Coca-Cola. (2010)\nMain article: 2010 FIFA World Cup event effects\n\n### Social[edit]\n\n\nTournament organiser Danny Jordaan dismissed concerns that the attack on the Togo national team which took place in Angola in January 2010 had any relevance to the security arrangements for the World Cup.[158] There were also reports of thefts against visitors to the country for the World Cup. Tourists from China, Portugal, Spain, South Korea, Japan and Colombia had become victims of crime.[159] On 19 June after the match between England and Algeria, a fan was able to break through the FIFA-appointed security staff at Green Point stadium and gain access to the England team dressing room. The breach took place shortly after Prince William and Prince Harry had left the room. The trespasser was then released before he could be handed over to the Police. The Football Association lodged a formal complaint with FIFA and demanded that security be increased.[160]\n\n\n\n#### Resettlement and eviction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A police patrol in Blikkiesdorp, a settlement for the evicted\nAs with many \"hallmark events\" throughout the world,[161] the 2010 FIFA World Cup has been connected to evictions,[162][163][164][165][166] which many claim are meant to 'beautify the city', impress visiting tourists, and hide shackdwellers. On 14 May 2009, the Durban-based shack-dwellers' movement Abahlali baseMjondolo took the KwaZulu-Natal government to court over their controversial Elimination and Prevention of Re-Emergence of Slums Act, meant to eliminate slums in South Africa and put homeless shackdwellers in transit camps in time for the 2010 World Cup.[167][168]\n\n\nAnother prominent controversy surrounding preparations for the World Cup was the N2 Gateway housing project in Cape Town, which planned to remove over 20,000 residents from the Joe Slovo Informal Settlement along the busy N2 Freeway and build rental flats and bond-houses in its place in time for the 2010 World Cup.[169] NGOs, international human rights organisations, and the Anti-Eviction Campaign have publicly criticised the conditions in Blikkiesdorp and said that the camp has been used to accommodate poor families evicted to make way for the 2010 World Cup.[166][170][171][172]\n\n\nHowever some have argued that evictions are ordinarily common in South Africa and that in the lead up to the tournament many evictions were erroneously ascribed to the World Cup.[173]\n\n\n\n### Economy[edit]\n\n\nSome groups experienced complications in regards to scheduled sporting events, advertising, or broadcasting, as FIFA attempted to maximise control of media rights during the Cup. Affected parties included an international rugby union Test match, a South African airline and some TV networks, all of whom were involved in various legal struggles with World Cup organisers.[174][175][176]\n\n\nDuring the tournament, group ticket-holders who did not utilise all their allotted tickets led to some early-round matches having as many as 11,000 unoccupied seats.[177]\n\n\nWhile the event did help to boost the image of South Africa, it turned out to be a major financial disappointment.[178] Construction costs for venues and infrastructure amounted to £3 billion (€3.6 billion), and the government expected that increased tourism would help to offset these costs to the amount of £570 million (€680 million). However, only £323 million (€385 million) were actually taken in as 309,000 foreign fans came to South Africa, well below the expected number of 450,000.[178]\n\n\nLocal vendors were prohibited from selling food and merchandise within a 1.5 kilometre radius of any stadium hosting a World Cup match. For a vendor to operate within the radius, a registration fee of R60,000 (approximately US$7,888 or €6,200) had to be paid to FIFA. This fee was out of most local vendors' reach, as they are simple one-man-operated vendors. This prevented international visitors from experiencing local South African food. Some local vendors felt cheated out of an opportunity for financial gain and spreading South African culture in favour of multinational corporations.[179]\n\n\nFIFA president Sepp Blatter declared the event \"a huge financial success for everybody, for Africa, for South Africa and for FIFA,\" with revenue to FIFA of £2.24 billion (€2 billion).[180]\n\n\n\n### Quality[edit]\n\n\nIn a December 2010 *Quality Progress*, FIFA President Blatter rated South Africa's organisational efforts a nine out of 10 scale, declaring that South Africa could be considered a plan B for all future competitions. The South African Quality Institute (SAQI) assisted in facility construction, event promotion, and organisations. The main issue listed in the article was lack of sufficient public transportation.[181]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n\n![](image)Production set of the FIFA international broadcast centre during the event\nThe 2010 FIFA World Cup was expected to be the most-watched television event in history.[182] Hundreds of broadcasters, representing about 70 countries, transmitted the Cup to a TV audience that FIFA officials expect to exceed a cumulative 26 billion people, an average of approximately 400 million viewers per match. FIFA estimated that around 700 million viewers would watch the World Cup final.[183]\n\n\nNew forms of digital media have also allowed viewers to watch coverage through alternative means. \"With games airing live on cell phones and computers, the World Cup will get more online coverage than any major sporting event yet,\" said Jake Coyle of the Associated Press.[184]\n\n\nIn the United States, ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 averaged a 2.1 rating, 2,288,000 households and 3,261,000 viewers for the 64 World Cup games. The rating was up 31 percent from a 1.6 in 2006, while households increased 32 percent from 1,735,000 and viewers rose from 2,316,000. The increases had been higher while the US remained in the tournament. Through the first 50 games, the rating was up 48 percent, households increased 54 percent and viewers rose 60 percent. Univision averaged 2,624,000 viewers for the tournament, up 17 percent, and 1,625,000 households, an increase of 11 percent.[185] An executive of the Nielsen Company, a leading audience research firm in the US, described the aggregate numbers for both networks' coverage of the match between the United States and Ghana as \"phenomenal\".[186] Live World Cup streaming on ESPN3.com pulled in some of the largest audiences in history, as 7.4 million unique viewers tuned in for matches. In total, ESPN3.com generated 942 million minutes of viewing or more than two hours per unique viewer. All 64 live matches were viewed by an average of 114,000 persons per minute. Most impressive were the numbers for the semi-final between Spain and Germany, which was viewed by 355,000 people per minute, making it ESPN3.com's largest average audience ever.[187]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSony technology was used to film the tournament. 25 of the matches were captured using 3D cameras.[188] Footage was captured in 3D through Sony's proprietary multi-image MPE-200 processors, housed in specially designed 3D outside broadcast trucks.[189] It supplied its flagship HDC-1500 cameras as well as its new HDC-P1 unit, a compact, point-of-view (POV)-type camera with 3, 2/3-inch CCD sensors.[190] The 3D games were produced for FIFA by Host Broadcast Services.[191]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nIn PlayStation Home, Sony released a virtual space based on the 2010 FIFA World Cup in the Japanese version of Home on 3 December 2009. This virtual space is called the \"FevaArena\" and is a virtual stadium of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, featuring different areas for events, a FIFA mini-game, and a shop with FIFA related content.[192]\n\n\nOn 27 April 2010, EA Sports released the official 2010 World Cup video game.[193]\n\n\n\n### FIFA Fan Fest[edit]\n\n\nFIFA expanded the FIFA Fan Fest, hosting in Sydney, Buenos Aires, Berlin, Paris, Rome, Rio de Janeiro, and Mexico City, as well as several venues around South Africa.[194] The Durban Fan Fest was the most popular in South Africa during the tournament followed by the Cape Town Fan Fest.[195]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n* ![flag](image)South Africa portal\n\n\n* July 2010 Kampala attacks, a series of terrorist bombings in Kampala, Uganda, timed to coincide with the final match\n* *Listen Up!

It was held from 9 June to 9 July 2006 in Germany, which had won the right to host the event in July 2000. Teams representing 198 national football associations from all six populated continents participated in the qualification process which began in September 2003. Thirty-one teams qualified from this process along with hosts Germany for the finals tournament. It was the second time that Germany staged the competition and the first as a unified country along with the former East Germany with Leipzig as a host city (the other was in 1974 in West Germany), and the 10th time that the tournament was held in Europe.\n\n\nItaly won the tournament, claiming their fourth World Cup title, defeating France 5–3 in a penalty shoot-out in the final after extra time had finished in a 1–1 draw. Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 to finish in third place. Angola, Ukraine, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Trinidad and Tobago and Togo made their first appearances in the finals. It was also the only appearance of Serbia and Montenegro under that name; they had previously appeared in 1998 as Yugoslavia. In late May 2006, immediately prior to the tournament, Montenegro voted in a referendum to become an independent nation and dissolve the loose confederacy then existing between it and Serbia; Serbia recognised the results of the referendum in early June. Due to time constraints, FIFA had Serbia and Montenegro play in the World Cup tournament as one team, marking the first instance of multiple sovereign nations competing as one team in a major football tournament since UEFA Euro 1992.\n\n\nThe 2006 World Cup stands as one of the most watched events in television history, garnering an estimated 26.29 billion times viewed compiled over the course of the tournament. The final attracted an estimated audience of 715.1 million people.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts\n\nThe vote to choose the hosts of the 2006 tournament was held in July 2000 in Zürich, Switzerland. It involved four bidding nations after Brazil had withdrawn three days earlier: Germany, South Africa, England and Morocco.[2] Three rounds of voting were required, each round eliminating the nation with the fewest votes. The first two rounds were held on 6 July 2000, and the final round was held on 7 July 2000, which Germany won over South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Voting results[3] |\n| --- |\n| Country\n | Round 1\n | Round 2\n | Round 3\n |\n| Germany | **10** | **11** | **12** |\n| South Africa | 6 | **11** | 11\n |\n| England | 5 | 2 | –\n |\n| Morocco | 3 | – | –\n |\n\n\n### Bribery and corruption allegations[edit]\n\n\nAccusations of bribery and corruption had marred the success of Germany's bid from the very beginning. On the very day of the vote, a hoax bribery affair was made public, leading to calls for a re-vote.[4] On the night before the vote, German satirical magazine *Titanic* sent letters to FIFA representatives, offering joke gifts like cuckoo clocks and Black Forest ham in exchange for their vote for Germany. Oceania delegate Charlie Dempsey, who had initially backed England, had then been instructed to support South Africa following England's elimination. He abstained, citing \"intolerable pressure\" on the eve of the vote.[5] Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed, the vote would have resulted with a 12–12 tie, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who favoured the South African bid,[6] would have had to cast the deciding vote.[7]\n\n\nMore irregularities surfaced soon after, including, in the months leading up to the decision, the sudden interest of German politicians and major businesses in the four Asian countries whose delegates were decisive for the vote.[8] Just a week before the vote, the German government under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder lifted their arms embargo on Saudi Arabia and agreed to send grenade launchers to the country. DaimlerChrysler invested several hundred million euros in Hyundai, where one of the sons of the company's founder was a member of FIFA's executive committee. Both Volkswagen and Bayer announced investments in Thailand and South Korea, whose respective delegates Worawi Makudi and Chung Mong-joon were possible voters for Germany.[8][9] Makudi additionally received a payment by a company of German media mogul Leo Kirch, who also paid millions for usually worthless TV rights for friendly matches of the Germany team and FC Bayern Munich.[8][9]\n\n\nOn 16 October 2015, German news magazine *Der Spiegel* alleged that a slush fund with money from then-Adidas CEO Robert Louis-Dreyfus was used to influence the vote of four Asian members of the FIFA executive committee.[10] The sum of €6.7 million was later demanded back by Dreyfus. In order to retrieve the money, the Organising Committee paid an equivalent sum to the FIFA, allegedly as a German share for the cost of a closing ceremony, which never materialized.[8] Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German Football Association (DFB), denied the allegations on 17 October 2015, saying that \"the World Cup was not bought\" and that he could \"absolutely and categorically rule out the existence of a slush fund\". The DFB announced they would consider seeking legal action against Der Spiegel.[11] During a press conference on 22 October 2015, Niersbach repeated his stance, emphasising that the €6.7 million was used in 2002 to secure a subsidy by FIFA.[12] According to Niersbach, the payment had been agreed upon during a meeting between Franz Beckenbauer and FIFA president Blatter, with the money being provided by Dreyfus. On the same day, FIFA contradicted Niersbach's statement, saying: \"By our current state of knowledge, no such payment of 10 million francs was registered by FIFA in 2002.\"[13] The following day, former DFB president Theo Zwanziger publicly accused Niersbach of lying, saying: \"It is evident that there was a slush fund for the German World Cup application\". According to Zwanziger, the €6.7 million went to Mohamed Bin Hammam, who at the time was supporting Blatter's campaign for president against Issa Hayatou.[14]\n\n\nOn 22 March 2016, it was announced that the FIFA Ethics Committee was opening proceedings into the bid.[15][16][17]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\n198 teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.[18] Germany, the host nation, was granted automatic qualification, with the remaining 31 finals places divided among the continental confederations. Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia), and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).\n\n\nEight nations qualified for the finals for the first time: Angola, Czech Republic, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, and Serbia and Montenegro. Czech Republic and Ukraine were making their first appearance as independent nations, but had previously been represented as part of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union respectively; Serbia and Montenegro had competed as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998, as well as making up part of Yugoslav teams from 1930 to 1990. As of 2022, this was the last time Togo, Angola, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Trinidad and Tobago qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the last time Uruguay failed to qualify.\n\n\nAustralia qualified for the first time since 1974. Among the teams who failed to qualify were 2002 third-placed team Turkey, quarter-finalists Senegal, Euro 2004 winners Greece and 2006 Africa Cup of Nations winners Egypt. Additionally, Belgium failed to qualify for the first time since 1978 and Cameroon failed to qualify for the first time since 1986. The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Nigeria, who had made the previous three tournaments, and Denmark and South Africa, who had both qualified for the previous two. France had their first successful qualifying campaign since 1986, as they did not qualify for the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, in 1998 they were automatically qualified as hosts and in 2002 as defending champions.\n\n\nFor the first time since the 1982 World Cup, all six confederations were represented at the finals tournament.\n\n\nThe State Union of Serbia and Montenegro dissolved prior to the start of the World Cup, on 3 June 2006, with Serbia and Montenegro becoming independent countries; their team competed at the World Cup unaffected. Their involvement in the competition became similar to the Commonwealth of Independent States that appeared at UEFA Euro 1992, a team formed to take the Soviet Union's place following dissolution, that multiple sovereign states had been represented in the finals of a major footballing tournament by a single team and the only occurrence in the World Cup finals to date. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Denmark (ranked 11th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Togo (ranked 61st).\n\n\n\n### List of qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings,[19] qualified for the finals tournament:\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AFC (4)* ![](image) Iran (23)\n* ![](image) Japan (18)\n* ![](image) Saudi Arabia (34)\n* ![](image) South Korea (29)\n\nCAF (5)* ![](image) Angola (57)\n* ![](image) Ghana (48)\n* ![](image) Ivory Coast (32)\n* ![](image) Togo (61)\n* ![](image) Tunisia (21)\n | CONCACAF (4)* ![](image) Costa Rica (26)\n* ![](image) Mexico (4)\n* ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (47)\n* ![](image) United States (5)\n\nCONMEBOL (4)* ![](image) Argentina (9)\n* ![](image) Brazil (1)\n* ![](image) Ecuador (39)\n* ![](image) Paraguay (33)\n\nOFC (1)* ![](image) Australia (42)\n | UEFA (14)* ![](image) Croatia (23)\n* ![](image) Czech Republic (2)\n* ![](image) England (10)\n* ![](image) France (8)\n* ![](image) Germany (19) (hosts)\n* ![](image) Italy (13)\n* ![](image) Netherlands (3)\n* ![](image) Poland (29)\n* ![](image) Portugal (7)\n* ![](image) Serbia and Montenegro (44)\n* ![](image) Spain (5)\n* ![](image) Sweden (16)\n* ![](image)  Switzerland (35)\n* ![](image) Ukraine (45)\n | ![](image)Countries qualified for World Cup\n Country did not qualify\n Countries that did not enter World Cup\n Country not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n\n\n| Teams listed by FIFA ranking as of May 2006[19] |\n| --- |\n|  | Country | Confederation | Rank\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Brazil | CONMEBOL | 1\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Czech Republic | UEFA | 2\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Netherlands | UEFA | 3\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Mexico | CONCACAF | 4\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) United States | CONCACAF | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | UEFA | 5\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Portugal | UEFA | 7\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) France | UEFA | 8\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Argentina | CONMEBOL | 9\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) England | UEFA | 10\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Italy | UEFA | 13\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Sweden | UEFA | 16\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Japan | AFC | 18\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Germany | UEFA | 19\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Tunisia | CAF | 21\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) Iran | AFC | 23\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | UEFA | 23\n |\n| 18 | ![](image) Costa Rica | CONCACAF | 25\n |\n| 19 | ![](image) South Korea | AFC | 29\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | UEFA | 29\n |\n| 21 | ![](image) Ivory Coast | CAF | 32\n |\n| 22 | ![](image) Paraguay | CONMEBOL | 33\n |\n| 23 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | AFC | 34\n |\n| 24 | ![](image)  Switzerland | UEFA | 35\n |\n| 25 | ![](image) Ecuador | CONMEBOL | 39\n |\n| 26 | ![](image) Australia | OFC | 42\n |\n| 27 | ![](image) Serbia and Montenegro | UEFA | 44\n |\n| 28 | ![](image) Ukraine | UEFA | 45\n |\n| 29 | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago | CONCACAF | 47\n |\n| 30 | ![](image) Ghana | CAF | 48\n |\n| 31 | ![](image) Angola | CAF | 57\n |\n| 32 | ![](image) Togo | CAF | 61\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Germany had a plethora of football stadia that satisfied FIFA's minimum capacity of 40,000 seats for World Cup matches. The outdated and still-standing Olympiastadion in Munich (69,250), the venue for the 1974 final match was not used for the tournament, even though FIFA's regulations allow one city to use two stadia. Düsseldorf's LTU Arena (51,500), Bremen's Weserstadion (43,000) and Mönchengladbach's Borussia-Park (46,249) were also not used.\n\n\nTwelve stadia were selected to host the World Cup matches. During the tournament, many of them were known by different names, as FIFA prohibits sponsorship of stadia unless the stadium sponsors are also official FIFA sponsors.[20] For example, the Allianz Arena in Munich was known during the competition as *FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich* (German: *FIFA WM-Stadion München*), and even the letters of the company Allianz were removed or covered.[20] Some of the stadia also had a lower capacity for the World Cup, as FIFA regulations ban standing room; nonetheless, this was accommodated as several stadia had a UEFA five-star ranking. The stadia in Berlin, Munich, Dortmund and Stuttgart hosted six matches each, while the other eight stadia hosted five matches each.\n\n\n\n* *A cross denotes an indoor stadium.*\n\n\n\n\n| Berlin | Munich, Bavaria | Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia | Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Olympiastadion | Allianz Arena**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich)** | Signal Iduna Park**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Dortmund)** | Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion |\n| 52°30′53″N 13°14′22″E﻿ / ﻿52.51472°N 13.23944°E﻿ / 52.51472; 13.23944﻿ (Olympiastadion (Berlin)) | 48°13′7.59″N 11°37′29.11″E﻿ / ﻿48.2187750°N 11.6247528°E﻿ / 48.2187750; 11.6247528﻿ (Allianz Arena) | 51°29′33.25″N 7°27′6.63″E﻿ / ﻿51.4925694°N 7.4518417°E﻿ / 51.4925694; 7.4518417﻿ (Signal Iduna Park) | 48°47′32.17″N 9°13′55.31″E﻿ / ﻿48.7922694°N 9.2320306°E﻿ / 48.7922694; 9.2320306﻿ (Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion) |\n| Capacity: **72,000**[21] | Capacity: **66,000**[22] | Capacity: **65,000**[23] | Capacity: **52,000**[24] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia | ![2006 FIFA World Cup is located in Germany](image)![Berlin](image)\n**Berlin**\n![Dortmund](image)\nDortmund\n![Munich](image)\nMunich\n![Stuttgart](image)\nStuttgart\n![Gelsenkirchen](image)\nGelsenkirchen\n![Hamburg](image)\nHamburg\n![Frankfurt](image)\nFrankfurt\n![Cologne](image)\nCologne\n![Hanover](image)\nHanover\n![Leipzig](image)\nLeipzig\n![Kaiserslautern](image)\nKaiserslautern\n![Nuremberg](image)\nNuremberg\n2006 FIFA World Cup (Germany)\n | Hamburg |\n| Arena AufSchalke†**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Gelsenkirchen)** | AOL Arena**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Hamburg)** |\n| 51°33′16.21″N 7°4′3.32″E﻿ / ﻿51.5545028°N 7.0675889°E﻿ / 51.5545028; 7.0675889﻿ (Arena AufSchalke) | 53°35′13.77″N 9°53′55.02″E﻿ / ﻿53.5871583°N 9.8986167°E﻿ / 53.5871583; 9.8986167﻿ (AOL Arena) |\n| Capacity: **52,000**[25] | Capacity: **50,000**[26] |\n|  | ![](image) |\n| Frankfurt, Hesse | Kaiserslautern, Rhineland-Palatinate |\n| Commerzbank-Arena†**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Frankfurt)** | Fritz-Walter-Stadion |\n| 50°4′6.86″N 8°38′43.65″E﻿ / ﻿50.0685722°N 8.6454583°E﻿ / 50.0685722; 8.6454583﻿ (Commerzbank Arena) | 49°26′4.96″N 7°46′35.24″E﻿ / ﻿49.4347111°N 7.7764556°E﻿ / 49.4347111; 7.7764556﻿ (Fritz-Walter-Stadion) |\n| Capacity: **48,000**[27] | Capacity: **46,000**[28] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia | Hanover, Lower Saxony | Leipzig, Saxony | Nuremberg, Bavaria |\n| RheinEnergieStadion**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Cologne)** | AWD-Arena**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Hanover)** | Zentralstadion | easyCredit-Stadion**(Frankenstadion)** |\n| 50°56′0.59″N 6°52′29.99″E﻿ / ﻿50.9334972°N 6.8749972°E﻿ / 50.9334972; 6.8749972﻿ (RheinEnergie Stadion) | 52°21′36.24″N 9°43′52.31″E﻿ / ﻿52.3600667°N 9.7311972°E﻿ / 52.3600667; 9.7311972﻿ (AWD-Arena) | 51°20′44.86″N 12°20′53.59″E﻿ / ﻿51.3457944°N 12.3482194°E﻿ / 51.3457944; 12.3482194﻿ (Zentralstadion) | 49°25′34″N 11°7′33″E﻿ / ﻿49.42611°N 11.12583°E﻿ / 49.42611; 11.12583﻿ (EasyCredit-Stadion) |\n| Capacity: **45,000**[29] | Capacity: **43,000**[30] | Capacity: **43,000**[31] | Capacity: **41,000**[32] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.

Each participating national association had to confirm its 23-player squad by 15 May 2006.[35]\n\n\n\n## Groups[edit]\n\n\n### Seeds[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2006 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\nThe eight seeded teams for the tournament were announced on 6 December 2005 and placed into Pot A for the draw. Pot B contained the unseeded qualifiers from South America, Africa and Oceania; Pot C contained eight of the nine remaining European teams, excluding Serbia and Montenegro. Pot D contained unseeded teams from the CONCACAF region and Asia. To ensure that no group contained three European teams, Serbia and Montenegro was placed in a special pot, as they were the lowest ranked qualified team from Europe on the latest FIFA World Ranking; while it was deemed of less importance they had been seeded higher than Switzerland and Ukraine by the 2006 World Cup seeding tool.[36] Serbia and Montenegro was drawn first, then their group was drawn from the three seeded non-European nations, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\n\nFIFA predetermined that, hosts, Germany would be placed in Group A, thus being assured of the venues of their group matches in advance of the draw. They also announced, in advance, that Brazil (the defending champion) would be allocated to Group F.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot A\n| Team | Points | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany[a] | 49.3 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Brazil | 63.7 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) England | 50.7 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 50.0 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 47.3 | 5\n |\n| ![](image) France | 46.0 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 44.3 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 44.0 | 8\n |\n\n | \n\nPot B\n| Team | Points | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Paraguay | 31.3 | 15\n |\n| ![](image) Tunisia | 19.0 | 22\n |\n| ![](image) Ecuador | 16.0 | 23\n |\n| ![](image) Ivory Coast | 7.0 | 27\n |\n| ![](image) Australia | 4.3 | 28\n |\n| ![](image) Ghana | 3.3 | 30\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | 2.0 | 31\n |\n| ![](image) Togo | 1.3 | 32\n |\n\n | \n\nPot C\n| Team | Points | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 38.3 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 33.7 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | 33.0 | 14\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 29.0 | 16\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 28.7 | 17\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | 20.3 | 20\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 8.7 | 25\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 7.0 | 26\n |\n\n | \n\nPot D\n| Team | Points | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) United States | 42.7 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) South Korea | 37.3 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Japan | 36.0 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Costa Rica | 22.7 | 18\n |\n| ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 20.7 | 19\n |\n| ![](image) Iran | 19.3 | 21\n |\n| ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago | 4.3 | 29\n |\n\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Pot\n| Team | Points | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Serbia and Montenegro | 15.7 | 24\n |\n\n\nThe group stage draw was held in Leipzig on 9 December 2005, and the group assignments and order of matches were determined. After the draw was completed, commentators remarked that Group C appeared to be the group of death, while others suggested Group E.[37][38] Argentina and the Netherlands both qualified with a game to spare with wins over Ivory Coast and Serbia and Montenegro respectively.\n\n\n\n### Group system[edit]\n\n\nThe first round, or group stage, saw the 32 teams divided into eight groups of four teams. Each group was a round-robin of three games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams coming first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16.\n\n\n\n#### Ranking criteria[edit]\n\n\nIf teams were level on points, they were ranked on the following criteria in order:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> 1. Greatest total goal difference in the three group matches\n> 2. Greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches\n> 3. If teams remained level after those criteria, a mini-group would be formed from those teams, who would be ranked on:\n> \t1. Most points earned in matches against other teams in the tie\n> \t2. Greatest goal difference in matches against other teams in the tie\n> \t3. Greatest number of goals scored in matches against other teams in the tie\n> 4. If teams remained level after all these criteria, FIFA would hold a drawing of lots\n> \n\n\nIn the original version of the rules for the finals tournament, the ranking criteria were in a different order, with head-to-head results taking precedence over total goal difference. The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria.[39]\nIn any event, the finals tournament saw only two pairs of teams level on points: Argentina and the Netherlands at 7 points in Group C; Tunisia and Saudi Arabia at 1 point in Group H. Both of these ties were resolved on total goal difference. Also, in both cases the teams had tied their match, so the order of ranking criteria made no difference.\n\n\n\n## Finals tournament[edit]\n\n\nFile:FIFA World Cup 2006 Opening Ceremony.jpg2006 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Munich\nThe finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on 9 June. The 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each, within which the teams competed in a round-robin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would advance to the sixteen-team knock-out stage, which started on 24 June. In total, 64 games were played.\n\n\n\n### Hosting[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Germany failed to win the Cup, the tournament was considered a great success for Germany in general. Germany also experienced a sudden increase in patriotic spirit with flags waving, traditionally frowned upon by German society since World War II whenever the German team played.[40] For the closing ceremonies, Matthias Keller composed a work performed simultaneously by the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bavarian State Orchestra and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra with conductors Christian Thielemann, Zubin Mehta and Mariss Jansons, and soloists Diana Damrau, Plácido Domingo and Lang Lang.\n\n\n\n### Traditional powers dominate[edit]\n\n\nDespite early success by Australia, Ecuador and Ghana, the tournament marked a return to dominance of traditional football powers. Four years after the 2002 tournament, in which teams from North America (the United States), Africa (Senegal) and Asia (South Korea) made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third, all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and none of the quarter-finalists were from outside Europe or South America. Six former champions took part in the quarter-finals, with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal as the only relative outsiders.[41] Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals, leaving an all-European final four for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\n\n### Scoring[edit]\n\n\nDespite the early goals that flooded the group stages, the knock-out phase had a much lower goals per match ratio. A prime example of the dearth of goals was Portugal, which only scored in the 23rd minute of the round of 16, and did not score again until the 88th minute of the third place play-off. No player managed to score a hat-trick in this tournament. Italy, Germany, Argentina, Brazil and France were the only teams to score more than one goal in a knockout match. Germany was one of the exceptions, tending to play an attacking style of football throughout the knock-out stage, which was reflected by the fact that they scored the most goals (14), with players from all three outfield positions (defence, midfield and forward) making the scoresheet.\n\n\nGermany's Miroslav Klose scored five goals to claim the Golden Boot, the lowest total to win the prize since 1962. No other player scored more than three goals. No player from the winning Italian squad scored more than two goals, though ten players had scored for the team, tying France's record in 1982 for the most goalscorers from any one team.\n\n\nFor the first time ever in the FIFA World Cup, the first and last goals of the tournament were scored by defenders. German left-back Philipp Lahm scored the opener against Costa Rica after only 5 minutes of the opening match. In the final, Italian centre-back Marco Materazzi out-jumped Patrick Vieira and headed in the last goal of the 2006 World Cup. In addition, Fabio Grosso clinched the cup for Italy with the decisive spot kick in the penalty shootout.\n\n\n\n### Unprecedented number of cards[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament had a record number of yellow and red cards, breaking the previous record set by the 1998 World Cup. Players received a record-breaking 345 yellow cards and 28 red cards, with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16 yellow and 4 red cards in the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands in a match known as the Battle of Nuremberg. Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarter-final and semi-final matches respectively. FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final, should their teams make it that far. The tournament also saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly hand out three yellow cards to Croatia's Josip Šimunić in their match against Australia.\n\n\nThe high number of yellow and red cards shown also prompted discussion about the tournament's referees. FIFA officials and President Sepp Blatter received criticism for allegedly making rules too rigid and taking discretion away from referees.[42]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Champion\n Runner-up\n Third place\n Fourth place\n Quarter-finals\n Round of 16\n Group stage\n\n*All times are Central European Summer Time (UTC+2).*\n\n\nIn the following tables:\n\n\n\n* **Pld** = total games played\n* **W** = total games won\n* **D** = total games drawn (tied)\n* **L** = total games lost\n* **GF** = total goals scored (goals for)\n* **GA** = total goals conceded (goals against)\n* **GD** = goal difference (GF−GA)\n* **Pts** = total points accumulated\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup Group A\n\nIn the opening match of the tournament, Germany and Costa Rica played a game which ended 4–2 for the host in the highest scoring opening match in the tournament's history.

The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in the group. Their 1–0 win against Croatia was through a goal late in the first-half by Kaká.

South Korea won their first World Cup finals match outside their own country in defeating Togo, but four points were not enough to see them through to the round of 16 (the only team for which this was the case), while Togo exited without a point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)  Switzerland | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 4\n | 0\n | +4\n | 7\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) France | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | 1\n | +2\n | 5\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) South Korea | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 3\n | 4\n | −1\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Togo | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 1\n | 6\n | −5\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n13 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| South Korea ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Togo |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Lee Chun-soo ![](image) 54'\n* Ahn Jung-hwan ![](image) 72'\n | Report | * Kader ![](image) 31'\n |\n\nWaldstadion, Frankfurt\nAttendance: 48,000\nReferee: Graham Poll (England)\n\n13 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 0–0 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nGottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, Stuttgart\nAttendance: 52,000\nReferee: Valentin Ivanov (Russia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 1–1 | ![](image) South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Henry ![](image) 9'\n | Report | * Park Ji-sung ![](image) 81'\n |\n\nZentralstadion, Leipzig\nAttendance: 43,000\nReferee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)\n\n19 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| Togo ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Frei ![](image) 16'\n* Barnetta ![](image) 88'\n |\n\nWestfalenstadion, Dortmund\nAttendance: 65,000\nReferee: Carlos Amarilla (Paraguay)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Togo ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Vieira ![](image) 55'\n* Henry ![](image) 61'\n |\n\nRheinEnergieStadion, Cologne\nAttendance: 45,000\nReferee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay)\n\n23 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Senderos ![](image) 23'\n* Frei ![](image) 77'\n | Report |  |\n\nNiedersachsenstadion, Hanover\nAttendance: 43,000\nReferee: Horacio Elizondo (Argentina)\n\n### Group H[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup Group H\n\nSpain dominated Group H, picking up the maximum number of points, scoring 8 goals, and conceding only 1.

There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were: round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final. There was also a play-off to decide third/fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, a draw was followed by thirty minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves); if scores were still level there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round.\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\nResults decided after extra time are indicated by (a.e.t.), and results decided via a penalty shoot-out are indicated by (p).\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Round of 16 |  | Quarter-finals |  | Semi-finals |  | Final |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 24 June – Munich |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | **![](image) Germany** | **2** |\n|  | 30 June – Berlin |\n|  | ![](image) Sweden | 0\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Germany** (p) | **1 (4)** |\n|  | 24 June – Leipzig |\n|  |  | ![](image) Argentina | 1 (2)\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Argentina** (a.e.t.) | **2** |\n|  |  | 4 July – Dortmund |\n|  | ![](image) Mexico | 1\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Germany | 0 |\n|  | 26 June – Kaiserslautern |\n|  |  | **![](image) Italy** (a.e.t.) | **2** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Italy** | **1** |\n|  | 30 June – Hamburg |  |\n|  | ![](image) Australia | 0\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Italy** | **3** |\n|  | 26 June – Cologne |\n|  |  | ![](image) Ukraine | 0\n |  |\n|  | ![](image)  Switzerland | 0 (0) |\n|  |  | 9 July – Berlin |\n|  | **![](image) Ukraine** (p) | **0 (3)** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Italy** (p) | **1 (5)** |\n|  | 25 June – Stuttgart |\n|  |  | ![](image) France | 1 (3)\n |\n|  | **![](image) England** | **1** |\n|  | 1 July – Gelsenkirchen |  |\n|  | ![](image) Ecuador | 0\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) England | 0 (1) |\n|  | 25 June – Nuremberg |\n|  |  | **![](image) Portugal** (p) | **0 (3)** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Portugal** | **1** |\n|  |  | 5 July – Munich |\n|  | ![](image) Netherlands | 0\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Portugal | 0 |\n|  | 27 June – Dortmund |\n|  |  | **![](image) France** | **1** |  | Third place play-off |\n|  | **![](image) Brazil** | **3** |\n|  | 1 July – Frankfurt |  | 8 July – Stuttgart |\n|  | ![](image) Ghana | 0\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Brazil | 0 | **![](image) Germany** | **3** |\n|  | 27 June – Hanover |\n|  |  | **![](image) France** | **1** |  | ![](image) Portugal | 1\n |\n|  | ![](image) Spain | 1 |\n|  |  |  |\n|  | **![](image) France** | **3** |  |\n|  |\n\n\n### Round of 16[edit]\n\n\nIn the second round, conceding two early goals in the first twelve minutes to Germany effectively ended the Swedes' hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals. Argentina struggled to get past Mexico until a Maxi Rodríguez goal in extra time put the *Albiceleste* in the quarter-finals. Australia's journey ended when Italians were awarded a controversial penalty, scored by Francesco Totti, deep into the remaining seconds of the match. The Italians had spent much of the game with only ten men on the field, following an equally controversial red card shown to centre back Marco Materazzi. In a 0–0 match, described in *The Guardian* as \"the dullest game in World Cup history\",[43] Switzerland failed to convert any of their three penalties in the penalty shoot-out against Ukraine to see them exit the competition with an unwanted new record in becoming the first team in a World Cup to fail to convert any penalties in a shootout. Their elimination also meant that they became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals (and indeed the only nation ever to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal). No two teams from the same group qualified for the quarters, all eight teams were from different groups.\n\n\nEngland struggled against Ecuador but won 1–0 thanks to a David Beckham free kick. Brazil won 3–0 against Ghana, in a game which included Ronaldo's record 15th World Cup goal. *Der Spiegel* reported that the match may have been influenced by an Asian betting syndicate.[44] Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0. The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match, which marked a new World Cup record with 16 yellow cards (Portugal: 9, the Netherlands: 7) and 4 players being sent off for a second bookable offence. France came from behind to defeat Spain 3–1 thanks to goals from Franck Ribéry, Patrick Vieira, and Zinedine Zidane.\n\n\n\n24 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Podolski ![](image) 4', 12'\n | Report |  |\n\nFIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich\nAttendance: 66,000\nReferee: Carlos Simon (Brazil)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n24 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Argentina ![](image) | 2–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Mexico |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Crespo ![](image) 10'\n* Rodríguez ![](image) 98'\n | Report | * Márquez ![](image) 6'\n |\n\nZentralstadion, Leipzig\nAttendance: 43,000\nReferee: Massimo Busacca (Switzerland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n25 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Ecuador |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Beckham ![](image) 60'\n | Report |  |\n\nGottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, Stuttgart\nAttendance: 52,000\nReferee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n25 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Maniche ![](image) 23'\n | Report |  |\n\nFrankenstadion, Nuremberg\nAttendance: 41,000\nReferee: Valentin Ivanov (Russia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n26 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| Italy ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Totti ![](image) 90+5' (pen.)\n | Report |  |\n\nFritz-Walter-Stadion, Kaiserslautern\nAttendance: 46,000\nReferee: Luis Medina Cantalejo (Spain)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n26 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Streller ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Barnetta ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Cabanas ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n | 0–3 | * ![soccer ball with red X](image) Shevchenko\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Milevskyi\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Rebrov\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Husiev\n |\n\nRheinEnergieStadion, Cologne\nAttendance: 45,000\nReferee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 3–0 | ![](image) Ghana |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ronaldo ![](image) 5'\n* Adriano ![](image) 45+1'\n* Zé Roberto ![](image) 84'\n | Report |  |\n\nWestfalenstadion, Dortmund\nAttendance: 65,000\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Spain ![](image) | 1–3 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Villa ![](image) 28' (pen.)\n | Report | * Ribéry ![](image) 41'\n* Vieira ![](image) 83'\n* Zidane ![](image) 90+2'\n |\n\nNiedersachsenstadion, Hanover\nAttendance: 43,000\nReferee: Roberto Rosetti (Italy)\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\nGermany and Argentina ended 1–1 after extra time; the hosts edged out the Argentinians 4–2 on penalties to go through to the semifinals (this was the first time Argentina had lost a World Cup penalty shootout: up until this match, Argentina and Germany had each participated in three penalty shootouts, winning all of them).\n\n\nIn Gelsenkirchen, England faced Portugal in a repeat of their Euro 2004 quarter-final. This time Wayne Rooney was sent off, and Portugal again won on penalties, 3–1 after a 0–0 draw to reach their first World Cup semi-final since the days of Eusébio 40 years earlier. This gave manager Luiz Felipe Scolari his third consecutive tournament quarter-final win over Sven-Göran Eriksson's England, first with Brazil en route to their 2002 World Cup win, then with Portugal in 2004 and 2006.\n\n\nItaly defeated quarter-final debutants Ukraine 3–0. France eliminated Brazil 1–0 to advance into the semi-finals. Brazil only managed one shot on goal, while Zinedine Zidane's dribbling earned him Man of the Match and his free-kick to Thierry Henry resulted in the winning goal.\n\n\n\n30 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Argentina |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Klose ![](image) 80'\n | Report | * Ayala ![](image) 49'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Neuville ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Ballack ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Podolski ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Borowski ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 4–2 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Cruz\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Ayala\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Rodríguez\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Cambiasso\n |\n\nOlympiastadion, Berlin\nAttendance: 72,000\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n30 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Italy ![](image) | 3–0 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Zambrotta ![](image) 6'\n* Toni ![](image) 59', 69'\n | Report |  |\n\nVolksparkstadion, Hamburg\nAttendance: 50,000\nReferee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Portugal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Lampard ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Hargreaves ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Gerrard ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Carragher ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n | 1–3 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Simão\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Viana\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Petit\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Postiga\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Ronaldo\n |\n\nArena AufSchalke, Gelsenkirchen\nAttendance: 52,000\nReferee: Horacio Elizondo (Argentina)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Henry ![](image) 57'\n |\n\nWaldstadion, Frankfurt\nAttendance: 48,000\nReferee: Luis Medina Cantalejo (Spain)\n\n### Semi-finals[edit]\n\n\nWith Argentina and Brazil eliminated in the quarter-finals, an all-European semi-final line up was completed for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\nThe semi-final between Germany and Italy produced an extra time period that went scoreless until the 118th minute, when Italy scored twice through Fabio Grosso and Alessandro Del Piero, putting an end to Germany's undefeated record in Dortmund.\n\n\nIn the second semi-final, Portugal lost to France 1–0 in Munich. In a repeat of the Euro 1984 and Euro 2000 semi-finals, Portugal were defeated by France, with the decisive goal being a penalty scored by France captain Zinedine Zidane.\n\n\n\n4 July 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 0–2 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Italy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Grosso ![](image) 119'\n* Del Piero ![](image) 120+1'\n |\n\nWestfalenstadion, Dortmund\nAttendance: 65,000\nReferee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n5 July 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Zidane ![](image) 33' (pen.)\n |\n\nAllianz Arena, Munich\nAttendance: 66,000\nReferee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay)\n\n### Third place play-off[edit]\n\n\nThe hosts got three goals in 20 minutes in the second half with the help of 21-year-old left midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. His first goal beat the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo with pace over his head. Only 4 minutes later, Schweinsteiger's free kick 30 metres from the left of the penalty box, driven low across goal, was connected with Petit's knee to become an own goal for Portugal. The German did not stop, and netted his second goal, which swerved away to the keeper's left, in the 78th minute.\n\n\nPortugal were strong in possession but lacked punch in attack; unable to convert 57% possession into goals. Pauleta had two clear chances from 15 metres, but both times hit tame shots that did not trouble keeper Oliver Kahn, who was playing in his last match for the German national team. Portugal got a consolation goal with the help of substitute Luís Figo (also playing the final international game of his career), who almost immediately provided the precise distribution needed to unlock the German defence. A cross from the right wing on 88 minutes found fellow substitute Nuno Gomes at the far post, who dived in for the goal. The game ended 3–1, a result which gave the tournament hosts the bronze medals and left Portugal in fourth place.\n\n\n\n8 July 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 3–1 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Schweinsteiger ![](image) 56', 78'\n* Petit ![](image) 60' (o.g.)\n | Report | * Nuno Gomes ![](image) 88'\n |\n\nGottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, Stuttgart\nAttendance: 52,000\nReferee: Toru Kamikawa (Japan)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup final\n\nThe final started with each side scoring within the first 20 minutes. Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring by converting a controversial seventh-minute penalty kick,[45] which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and bounced beyond the goal line before it spun back up, hit the crossbar again and rebounded out of the goal.[46] Marco Materazzi then levelled the scores in the 19th minute following an Andrea Pirlo corner. Both teams had chances to score the winning goal in normal time: Luca Toni hit the crossbar in the 35th minute for Italy (he later had a header disallowed for offside), while France were not awarded a possible second penalty in the 53rd minute when Florent Malouda went down in the box after a tackle from Gianluca Zambrotta.\n\n\nAt the end of the regulation 90 minutes, the score was still level at 1–1, and the match went into extra time. Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon made a potentially game-saving save in extra time when he tipped a Zidane header over the crossbar. Further controversy ensued near the end of extra time, when Zidane head-butted Materazzi in the chest in an off-the-ball incident and was sent off. Extra time produced no further goals and a penalty shootout followed, which Italy won 5–3. France's David Trezeguet, the man who scored the golden goal against Italy in Euro 2000, was the only player not to score his penalty; his spot kick hit the crossbar, landed on the goal line, and went out. It was the first all-European final since Italy's triumph over West Germany in the 1982 World Cup, and the second final, after 1994, to be decided on penalties.

The experience of past World Cups and public viewing was conceptualized in 4-week-long events for football supporters to meet, board, interact, partake in cultural activities and watch all 64 matches on giant video walls. Since 2004, the details on costs, logistics, safety issues, marketing and broadcasting rights were jointly hammered out by FIFA and the host cities.[52] These public viewing events, known as \"Fan Fests\" (German: *Fanmeile*), served an idea to provide football supporters without tickets a legitimate opportunity to partake in the World Cup. Unlike the past tournaments where ticket-less fans were treated as security risks, the World Cup in Germany welcomed all supporters, thus generating positive atmosphere even before the tournament began. Even though security planners and media were sceptical and cautious on the matter of public viewing, the scepticism was cast aside with the beginning of the World Cup.[53]\n\n\nFan Fests for the World Cup were set up in 12 host cities and attracted 21 million visitors over the duration of tournament according to German National Tourist Board (FIFA claimed there were over 18 million visitors).[54][55] The Berlin Fan Fest was located at the pedestrianised Straße des 17. Juni, between Brandenburg Gate and the Victory Column, with 14 consecutive video walls attracted 9 million fans over the duration of World Cup with nearly a million supporters in each match that Germany played. For the first time in German history, an event scored more visitors than Oktoberfest.[56] The Cologne Fan Fest scored 3 million visitors, followed by 1.9 million in Frankfurt, 1.5 million in Stuttgart, 1.46 million in Hamburg, 1 million in Dortmund and Munich, 500,000 in Nuremberg and Hannover, 471,000 in Leipzig, 350,000 in Gelsenkirchen and 205,000 in Kaiserslautern. Those numbers exceeded all expectations and some of the Host Cities had to expand the Fan Fest areas in the middle of the World Cup.[57] The most popular Fan Fests were located in the inner city areas, making the approach to keep the city centre generally \"fan-free\" applied by the authorities of Nuremberg ineffective as many football supporters preferred to stay in the picturesque city centre.[53] According to surveys conducted during the 2006 FIFA World Cup at the Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich Fan Fests, 28% of visitors travelled over 100 kilometres to attend to event and up to 84% came there together with friends. Around 21% of foreigners interviewed at Fan Fests visited Germany to see the World Cup without tickets to any match.[58][59] Media coverage of events had an additional positive effect as pictures of fans celebrating in front of giant screens attracted even more visitors from neighbouring European countries that spontaneously decided to take part in celebrations at Fan Fests.[53]\n\n\nDespite minor inconsistencies in planning and execution, the Fan Fest concept was so successful in fact, numerous people later claimed personal responsibility for the invention.[53] The visitors' expectations regarding Fan Fests were fulfilled. During the World Cup, Fan Fests served as modern market squares where communication and interaction strengthen the feeling of community. Out-of-home media reception made the emotional aspect of escape from everyday life more intense for participants. Pictures of football supporters celebrating in front of video walls became a typical illustration of atmosphere in the country, while \"Fanmeile\" was later picked up as the German Word of the Year.[60] In 2007, FIFA and the 12 host cities received the German Marketing Prize for Sports for the innovative nature and marketing concept of Fan Fests.[61] FIFA and the Host Cities succeeded in creating and comfortable environment for foreign fans as 95% of them surveyed at Fan Fests agreed that it was an unequivocal declaration of international nature of World Cup and not a mere event for Germans.[58] A thought-out implementation of public viewing at such a large-scale football event as the 2006 World Cup became set a precedent. Immediately after the World Cup, FIFA announced that it registered the trademark for Fan Fests, taking over the organisation and marketing and making Fan Fests an integral part of future World Cups.[62]\n\n\n\n### Locations[edit]\n\n\n* Berlin — Straße des 17.

The team's trainer, Jürgen Klinsmann, in February 2007 was furthermore awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz, not least for his reformed methods of modern training and playing methods, in which he persevered despite harsh criticism. Nevertheless, Klinsmann announced after the tournament that he would not extend his contract as trainer of the national team, since he felt completely burned-out and wished to spend more time with his family in California. The German Football Association (DFB) on the same day named as Klinsmann's successor his assistant trainer Joachim Löw, since in the opinion of the DFB leadership he would best continue Klinsmann's work and training methods.\n\n\nAccording to a representative survey taken in Trier by the European Tourism Institute (ETI), 96% of the German population considered that Germany was a good host during the World Cup. Additionally 93% of those interviewed found the international football fans to be agreeable.[107]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n\n\n* 2006 FIFA World Cup:\n\t+ A time to make friends\n\t+ Broadcasting rights\n\t+ Controversies\n\t+ Disciplinary record\n\t+ Officials\n\t+ Organizing Committee\n\t+ Qualification\n\t+ Seeding\n\t+ Sponsorship\n\t+ Squads\n\t+ FIFA World Cup records\n* Leeuwenhosen controversy\n* *Strangers*, a 2007 film which takes place during the 2006 World Cup\n* *Deutschland.

It was held from 9 June to 9 July 2006 in Germany, which had won the right to host the event in July 2000. Teams representing 198 national football associations from all six populated continents participated in the qualification process which began in September 2003. Thirty-one teams qualified from this process along with hosts Germany for the finals tournament. It was the second time that Germany staged the competition and the first as a unified country along with the former East Germany with Leipzig as a host city (the other was in 1974 in West Germany), and the 10th time that the tournament was held in Europe.\n\n\nItaly won the tournament, claiming their fourth World Cup title, defeating France 5–3 in a penalty shoot-out in the final after extra time had finished in a 1–1 draw. Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 to finish in third place. Angola, Ukraine, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Trinidad and Tobago and Togo made their first appearances in the finals. It was also the only appearance of Serbia and Montenegro under that name; they had previously appeared in 1998 as Yugoslavia. In late May 2006, immediately prior to the tournament, Montenegro voted in a referendum to become an independent nation and dissolve the loose confederacy then existing between it and Serbia; Serbia recognised the results of the referendum in early June. Due to time constraints, FIFA had Serbia and Montenegro play in the World Cup tournament as one team, marking the first instance of multiple sovereign nations competing as one team in a major football tournament since UEFA Euro 1992.\n\n\nThe 2006 World Cup stands as one of the most watched events in television history, garnering an estimated 26.29 billion times viewed compiled over the course of the tournament. The final attracted an estimated audience of 715.1 million people.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts\n\nThe vote to choose the hosts of the 2006 tournament was held in July 2000 in Zürich, Switzerland. It involved four bidding nations after Brazil had withdrawn three days earlier: Germany, South Africa, England and Morocco.[2] Three rounds of voting were required, each round eliminating the nation with the fewest votes. The first two rounds were held on 6 July 2000, and the final round was held on 7 July 2000, which Germany won over South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Voting results[3] |\n| --- |\n| Country\n | Round 1\n | Round 2\n | Round 3\n |\n| Germany | **10** | **11** | **12** |\n| South Africa | 6 | **11** | 11\n |\n| England | 5 | 2 | –\n |\n| Morocco | 3 | – | –\n |\n\n\n### Bribery and corruption allegations[edit]\n\n\nAccusations of bribery and corruption had marred the success of Germany's bid from the very beginning. On the very day of the vote, a hoax bribery affair was made public, leading to calls for a re-vote.[4] On the night before the vote, German satirical magazine *Titanic* sent letters to FIFA representatives, offering joke gifts like cuckoo clocks and Black Forest ham in exchange for their vote for Germany. Oceania delegate Charlie Dempsey, who had initially backed England, had then been instructed to support South Africa following England's elimination. He abstained, citing \"intolerable pressure\" on the eve of the vote.[5] Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed, the vote would have resulted with a 12–12 tie, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who favoured the South African bid,[6] would have had to cast the deciding vote.[7]\n\n\nMore irregularities surfaced soon after, including, in the months leading up to the decision, the sudden interest of German politicians and major businesses in the four Asian countries whose delegates were decisive for the vote.[8] Just a week before the vote, the German government under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder lifted their arms embargo on Saudi Arabia and agreed to send grenade launchers to the country. DaimlerChrysler invested several hundred million euros in Hyundai, where one of the sons of the company's founder was a member of FIFA's executive committee. Both Volkswagen and Bayer announced investments in Thailand and South Korea, whose respective delegates Worawi Makudi and Chung Mong-joon were possible voters for Germany.[8][9] Makudi additionally received a payment by a company of German media mogul Leo Kirch, who also paid millions for usually worthless TV rights for friendly matches of the Germany team and FC Bayern Munich.[8][9]\n\n\nOn 16 October 2015, German news magazine *Der Spiegel* alleged that a slush fund with money from then-Adidas CEO Robert Louis-Dreyfus was used to influence the vote of four Asian members of the FIFA executive committee.[10] The sum of €6.7 million was later demanded back by Dreyfus. In order to retrieve the money, the Organising Committee paid an equivalent sum to the FIFA, allegedly as a German share for the cost of a closing ceremony, which never materialized.[8] Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German Football Association (DFB), denied the allegations on 17 October 2015, saying that \"the World Cup was not bought\" and that he could \"absolutely and categorically rule out the existence of a slush fund\". The DFB announced they would consider seeking legal action against Der Spiegel.[11] During a press conference on 22 October 2015, Niersbach repeated his stance, emphasising that the €6.7 million was used in 2002 to secure a subsidy by FIFA.[12] According to Niersbach, the payment had been agreed upon during a meeting between Franz Beckenbauer and FIFA president Blatter, with the money being provided by Dreyfus. On the same day, FIFA contradicted Niersbach's statement, saying: \"By our current state of knowledge, no such payment of 10 million francs was registered by FIFA in 2002.\"[13] The following day, former DFB president Theo Zwanziger publicly accused Niersbach of lying, saying: \"It is evident that there was a slush fund for the German World Cup application\". According to Zwanziger, the €6.7 million went to Mohamed Bin Hammam, who at the time was supporting Blatter's campaign for president against Issa Hayatou.[14]\n\n\nOn 22 March 2016, it was announced that the FIFA Ethics Committee was opening proceedings into the bid.[15][16][17]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\n198 teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.[18] Germany, the host nation, was granted automatic qualification, with the remaining 31 finals places divided among the continental confederations. Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia), and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).\n\n\nEight nations qualified for the finals for the first time: Angola, Czech Republic, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, and Serbia and Montenegro. Czech Republic and Ukraine were making their first appearance as independent nations, but had previously been represented as part of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union respectively; Serbia and Montenegro had competed as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998, as well as making up part of Yugoslav teams from 1930 to 1990. As of 2022, this was the last time Togo, Angola, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Trinidad and Tobago qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the last time Uruguay failed to qualify.\n\n\nAustralia qualified for the first time since 1974. Among the teams who failed to qualify were 2002 third-placed team Turkey, quarter-finalists Senegal, Euro 2004 winners Greece and 2006 Africa Cup of Nations winners Egypt. Additionally, Belgium failed to qualify for the first time since 1978 and Cameroon failed to qualify for the first time since 1986. The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Nigeria, who had made the previous three tournaments, and Denmark and South Africa, who had both qualified for the previous two. France had their first successful qualifying campaign since 1986, as they did not qualify for the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, in 1998 they were automatically qualified as hosts and in 2002 as defending champions.\n\n\nFor the first time since the 1982 World Cup, all six confederations were represented at the finals tournament.\n\n\nThe State Union of Serbia and Montenegro dissolved prior to the start of the World Cup, on 3 June 2006, with Serbia and Montenegro becoming independent countries; their team competed at the World Cup unaffected. Their involvement in the competition became similar to the Commonwealth of Independent States that appeared at UEFA Euro 1992, a team formed to take the Soviet Union's place following dissolution, that multiple sovereign states had been represented in the finals of a major footballing tournament by a single team and the only occurrence in the World Cup finals to date. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Denmark (ranked 11th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Togo (ranked 61st).\n\n\n\n### List of qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings,[19] qualified for the finals tournament:\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AFC (4)* ![](image) Iran (23)\n* ![](image) Japan (18)\n* ![](image) Saudi Arabia (34)\n* ![](image) South Korea (29)\n\nCAF (5)* ![](image) Angola (57)\n* ![](image) Ghana (48)\n* ![](image) Ivory Coast (32)\n* ![](image) Togo (61)\n* ![](image) Tunisia (21)\n | CONCACAF (4)* ![](image) Costa Rica (26)\n* ![](image) Mexico (4)\n* ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (47)\n* ![](image) United States (5)\n\nCONMEBOL (4)* ![](image) Argentina (9)\n* ![](image) Brazil (1)\n* ![](image) Ecuador (39)\n* ![](image) Paraguay (33)\n\nOFC (1)* ![](image) Australia (42)\n | UEFA (14)* ![](image) Croatia (23)\n* ![](image) Czech Republic (2)\n* ![](image) England (10)\n* ![](image) France (8)\n* ![](image) Germany (19) (hosts)\n* ![](image) Italy (13)\n* ![](image) Netherlands (3)\n* ![](image) Poland (29)\n* ![](image) Portugal (7)\n* ![](image) Serbia and Montenegro (44)\n* ![](image) Spain (5)\n* ![](image) Sweden (16)\n* ![](image)  Switzerland (35)\n* ![](image) Ukraine (45)\n | ![](image)Countries qualified for World Cup\n Country did not qualify\n Countries that did not enter World Cup\n Country not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n\n\n| Teams listed by FIFA ranking as of May 2006[19] |\n| --- |\n|  | Country | Confederation | Rank\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Brazil | CONMEBOL | 1\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Czech Republic | UEFA | 2\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Netherlands | UEFA | 3\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Mexico | CONCACAF | 4\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) United States | CONCACAF | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | UEFA | 5\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Portugal | UEFA | 7\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) France | UEFA | 8\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Argentina | CONMEBOL | 9\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) England | UEFA | 10\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Italy | UEFA | 13\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Sweden | UEFA | 16\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Japan | AFC | 18\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Germany | UEFA | 19\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Tunisia | CAF | 21\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) Iran | AFC | 23\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | UEFA | 23\n |\n| 18 | ![](image) Costa Rica | CONCACAF | 25\n |\n| 19 | ![](image) South Korea | AFC | 29\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | UEFA | 29\n |\n| 21 | ![](image) Ivory Coast | CAF | 32\n |\n| 22 | ![](image) Paraguay | CONMEBOL | 33\n |\n| 23 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | AFC | 34\n |\n| 24 | ![](image)  Switzerland | UEFA | 35\n |\n| 25 | ![](image) Ecuador | CONMEBOL | 39\n |\n| 26 | ![](image) Australia | OFC | 42\n |\n| 27 | ![](image) Serbia and Montenegro | UEFA | 44\n |\n| 28 | ![](image) Ukraine | UEFA | 45\n |\n| 29 | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago | CONCACAF | 47\n |\n| 30 | ![](image) Ghana | CAF | 48\n |\n| 31 | ![](image) Angola | CAF | 57\n |\n| 32 | ![](image) Togo | CAF | 61\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Germany had a plethora of football stadia that satisfied FIFA's minimum capacity of 40,000 seats for World Cup matches. The outdated and still-standing Olympiastadion in Munich (69,250), the venue for the 1974 final match was not used for the tournament, even though FIFA's regulations allow one city to use two stadia. Düsseldorf's LTU Arena (51,500), Bremen's Weserstadion (43,000) and Mönchengladbach's Borussia-Park (46,249) were also not used.\n\n\nTwelve stadia were selected to host the World Cup matches. During the tournament, many of them were known by different names, as FIFA prohibits sponsorship of stadia unless the stadium sponsors are also official FIFA sponsors.[20] For example, the Allianz Arena in Munich was known during the competition as *FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich* (German: *FIFA WM-Stadion München*), and even the letters of the company Allianz were removed or covered.[20] Some of the stadia also had a lower capacity for the World Cup, as FIFA regulations ban standing room; nonetheless, this was accommodated as several stadia had a UEFA five-star ranking. The stadia in Berlin, Munich, Dortmund and Stuttgart hosted six matches each, while the other eight stadia hosted five matches each.\n\n\n\n* *A cross denotes an indoor stadium.*\n\n\n\n\n| Berlin | Munich, Bavaria | Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia | Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Olympiastadion | Allianz Arena**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich)** | Signal Iduna Park**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Dortmund)** | Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion |\n| 52°30′53″N 13°14′22″E﻿ / ﻿52.51472°N 13.23944°E﻿ / 52.51472; 13.23944﻿ (Olympiastadion (Berlin)) | 48°13′7.59″N 11°37′29.11″E﻿ / ﻿48.2187750°N 11.6247528°E﻿ / 48.2187750; 11.6247528﻿ (Allianz Arena) | 51°29′33.25″N 7°27′6.63″E﻿ / ﻿51.4925694°N 7.4518417°E﻿ / 51.4925694; 7.4518417﻿ (Signal Iduna Park) | 48°47′32.17″N 9°13′55.31″E﻿ / ﻿48.7922694°N 9.2320306°E﻿ / 48.7922694; 9.2320306﻿ (Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion) |\n| Capacity: **72,000**[21] | Capacity: **66,000**[22] | Capacity: **65,000**[23] | Capacity: **52,000**[24] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia | ![2006 FIFA World Cup is located in Germany](image)![Berlin](image)\n**Berlin**\n![Dortmund](image)\nDortmund\n![Munich](image)\nMunich\n![Stuttgart](image)\nStuttgart\n![Gelsenkirchen](image)\nGelsenkirchen\n![Hamburg](image)\nHamburg\n![Frankfurt](image)\nFrankfurt\n![Cologne](image)\nCologne\n![Hanover](image)\nHanover\n![Leipzig](image)\nLeipzig\n![Kaiserslautern](image)\nKaiserslautern\n![Nuremberg](image)\nNuremberg\n2006 FIFA World Cup (Germany)\n | Hamburg |\n| Arena AufSchalke†**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Gelsenkirchen)** | AOL Arena**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Hamburg)** |\n| 51°33′16.21″N 7°4′3.32″E﻿ / ﻿51.5545028°N 7.0675889°E﻿ / 51.5545028; 7.0675889﻿ (Arena AufSchalke) | 53°35′13.77″N 9°53′55.02″E﻿ / ﻿53.5871583°N 9.8986167°E﻿ / 53.5871583; 9.8986167﻿ (AOL Arena) |\n| Capacity: **52,000**[25] | Capacity: **50,000**[26] |\n|  | ![](image) |\n| Frankfurt, Hesse | Kaiserslautern, Rhineland-Palatinate |\n| Commerzbank-Arena†**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Frankfurt)** | Fritz-Walter-Stadion |\n| 50°4′6.86″N 8°38′43.65″E﻿ / ﻿50.0685722°N 8.6454583°E﻿ / 50.0685722; 8.6454583﻿ (Commerzbank Arena) | 49°26′4.96″N 7°46′35.24″E﻿ / ﻿49.4347111°N 7.7764556°E﻿ / 49.4347111; 7.7764556﻿ (Fritz-Walter-Stadion) |\n| Capacity: **48,000**[27] | Capacity: **46,000**[28] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia | Hanover, Lower Saxony | Leipzig, Saxony | Nuremberg, Bavaria |\n| RheinEnergieStadion**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Cologne)** | AWD-Arena**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Hanover)** | Zentralstadion | easyCredit-Stadion**(Frankenstadion)** |\n| 50°56′0.59″N 6°52′29.99″E﻿ / ﻿50.9334972°N 6.8749972°E﻿ / 50.9334972; 6.8749972﻿ (RheinEnergie Stadion) | 52°21′36.24″N 9°43′52.31″E﻿ / ﻿52.3600667°N 9.7311972°E﻿ / 52.3600667; 9.7311972﻿ (AWD-Arena) | 51°20′44.86″N 12°20′53.59″E﻿ / ﻿51.3457944°N 12.3482194°E﻿ / 51.3457944; 12.3482194﻿ (Zentralstadion) | 49°25′34″N 11°7′33″E﻿ / ﻿49.42611°N 11.12583°E﻿ / 49.42611; 11.12583﻿ (EasyCredit-Stadion) |\n| Capacity: **45,000**[29] | Capacity: **43,000**[30] | Capacity: **43,000**[31] | Capacity: **41,000**[32] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.

Each participating national association had to confirm its 23-player squad by 15 May 2006.[35]\n\n\n\n## Groups[edit]\n\n\n### Seeds[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2006 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\nThe eight seeded teams for the tournament were announced on 6 December 2005 and placed into Pot A for the draw. Pot B contained the unseeded qualifiers from South America, Africa and Oceania; Pot C contained eight of the nine remaining European teams, excluding Serbia and Montenegro. Pot D contained unseeded teams from the CONCACAF region and Asia. To ensure that no group contained three European teams, Serbia and Montenegro was placed in a special pot, as they were the lowest ranked qualified team from Europe on the latest FIFA World Ranking; while it was deemed of less importance they had been seeded higher than Switzerland and Ukraine by the 2006 World Cup seeding tool.[36] Serbia and Montenegro was drawn first, then their group was drawn from the three seeded non-European nations, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\n\nFIFA predetermined that, hosts, Germany would be placed in Group A, thus being assured of the venues of their group matches in advance of the draw. They also announced, in advance, that Brazil (the defending champion) would be allocated to Group F.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot A\n| Team | Points | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany[a] | 49.3 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Brazil | 63.7 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) England | 50.7 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 50.0 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 47.3 | 5\n |\n| ![](image) France | 46.0 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 44.3 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 44.0 | 8\n |\n\n | \n\nPot B\n| Team | Points | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Paraguay | 31.3 | 15\n |\n| ![](image) Tunisia | 19.0 | 22\n |\n| ![](image) Ecuador | 16.0 | 23\n |\n| ![](image) Ivory Coast | 7.0 | 27\n |\n| ![](image) Australia | 4.3 | 28\n |\n| ![](image) Ghana | 3.3 | 30\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | 2.0 | 31\n |\n| ![](image) Togo | 1.3 | 32\n |\n\n | \n\nPot C\n| Team | Points | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 38.3 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 33.7 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | 33.0 | 14\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 29.0 | 16\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 28.7 | 17\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | 20.3 | 20\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 8.7 | 25\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 7.0 | 26\n |\n\n | \n\nPot D\n| Team | Points | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) United States | 42.7 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) South Korea | 37.3 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Japan | 36.0 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Costa Rica | 22.7 | 18\n |\n| ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 20.7 | 19\n |\n| ![](image) Iran | 19.3 | 21\n |\n| ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago | 4.3 | 29\n |\n\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Pot\n| Team | Points | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Serbia and Montenegro | 15.7 | 24\n |\n\n\nThe group stage draw was held in Leipzig on 9 December 2005, and the group assignments and order of matches were determined. After the draw was completed, commentators remarked that Group C appeared to be the group of death, while others suggested Group E.[37][38] Argentina and the Netherlands both qualified with a game to spare with wins over Ivory Coast and Serbia and Montenegro respectively.\n\n\n\n### Group system[edit]\n\n\nThe first round, or group stage, saw the 32 teams divided into eight groups of four teams. Each group was a round-robin of three games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams coming first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16.\n\n\n\n#### Ranking criteria[edit]\n\n\nIf teams were level on points, they were ranked on the following criteria in order:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> 1. Greatest total goal difference in the three group matches\n> 2. Greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches\n> 3. If teams remained level after those criteria, a mini-group would be formed from those teams, who would be ranked on:\n> \t1. Most points earned in matches against other teams in the tie\n> \t2. Greatest goal difference in matches against other teams in the tie\n> \t3. Greatest number of goals scored in matches against other teams in the tie\n> 4. If teams remained level after all these criteria, FIFA would hold a drawing of lots\n> \n\n\nIn the original version of the rules for the finals tournament, the ranking criteria were in a different order, with head-to-head results taking precedence over total goal difference. The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria.[39]\nIn any event, the finals tournament saw only two pairs of teams level on points: Argentina and the Netherlands at 7 points in Group C; Tunisia and Saudi Arabia at 1 point in Group H. Both of these ties were resolved on total goal difference. Also, in both cases the teams had tied their match, so the order of ranking criteria made no difference.\n\n\n\n## Finals tournament[edit]\n\n\nFile:FIFA World Cup 2006 Opening Ceremony.jpg2006 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Munich\nThe finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on 9 June. The 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each, within which the teams competed in a round-robin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would advance to the sixteen-team knock-out stage, which started on 24 June. In total, 64 games were played.\n\n\n\n### Hosting[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Germany failed to win the Cup, the tournament was considered a great success for Germany in general. Germany also experienced a sudden increase in patriotic spirit with flags waving, traditionally frowned upon by German society since World War II whenever the German team played.[40] For the closing ceremonies, Matthias Keller composed a work performed simultaneously by the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bavarian State Orchestra and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra with conductors Christian Thielemann, Zubin Mehta and Mariss Jansons, and soloists Diana Damrau, Plácido Domingo and Lang Lang.\n\n\n\n### Traditional powers dominate[edit]\n\n\nDespite early success by Australia, Ecuador and Ghana, the tournament marked a return to dominance of traditional football powers. Four years after the 2002 tournament, in which teams from North America (the United States), Africa (Senegal) and Asia (South Korea) made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third, all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and none of the quarter-finalists were from outside Europe or South America. Six former champions took part in the quarter-finals, with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal as the only relative outsiders.[41] Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals, leaving an all-European final four for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\n\n### Scoring[edit]\n\n\nDespite the early goals that flooded the group stages, the knock-out phase had a much lower goals per match ratio. A prime example of the dearth of goals was Portugal, which only scored in the 23rd minute of the round of 16, and did not score again until the 88th minute of the third place play-off. No player managed to score a hat-trick in this tournament. Italy, Germany, Argentina, Brazil and France were the only teams to score more than one goal in a knockout match. Germany was one of the exceptions, tending to play an attacking style of football throughout the knock-out stage, which was reflected by the fact that they scored the most goals (14), with players from all three outfield positions (defence, midfield and forward) making the scoresheet.\n\n\nGermany's Miroslav Klose scored five goals to claim the Golden Boot, the lowest total to win the prize since 1962. No other player scored more than three goals. No player from the winning Italian squad scored more than two goals, though ten players had scored for the team, tying France's record in 1982 for the most goalscorers from any one team.\n\n\nFor the first time ever in the FIFA World Cup, the first and last goals of the tournament were scored by defenders. German left-back Philipp Lahm scored the opener against Costa Rica after only 5 minutes of the opening match. In the final, Italian centre-back Marco Materazzi out-jumped Patrick Vieira and headed in the last goal of the 2006 World Cup. In addition, Fabio Grosso clinched the cup for Italy with the decisive spot kick in the penalty shootout.\n\n\n\n### Unprecedented number of cards[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament had a record number of yellow and red cards, breaking the previous record set by the 1998 World Cup. Players received a record-breaking 345 yellow cards and 28 red cards, with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16 yellow and 4 red cards in the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands in a match known as the Battle of Nuremberg. Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarter-final and semi-final matches respectively. FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final, should their teams make it that far. The tournament also saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly hand out three yellow cards to Croatia's Josip Šimunić in their match against Australia.\n\n\nThe high number of yellow and red cards shown also prompted discussion about the tournament's referees. FIFA officials and President Sepp Blatter received criticism for allegedly making rules too rigid and taking discretion away from referees.[42]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Champion\n Runner-up\n Third place\n Fourth place\n Quarter-finals\n Round of 16\n Group stage\n\n*All times are Central European Summer Time (UTC+2).*\n\n\nIn the following tables:\n\n\n\n* **Pld** = total games played\n* **W** = total games won\n* **D** = total games drawn (tied)\n* **L** = total games lost\n* **GF** = total goals scored (goals for)\n* **GA** = total goals conceded (goals against)\n* **GD** = goal difference (GF−GA)\n* **Pts** = total points accumulated\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup Group A\n\nIn the opening match of the tournament, Germany and Costa Rica played a game which ended 4–2 for the host in the highest scoring opening match in the tournament's history.

The US bowed out of the tournament after disappointing results against the Czech Republic and Ghana, 0–3 and 1–2, respectively, despite a 1–1 draw (finishing with 9 vs 10 men) against Italy. Tournament debutant Ghana joined Italy in the round of 16, following victories over the Czech Republic and the United States. Daniele De Rossi was suspended for 4 games following his sending-off against the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Italy | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 1\n | +4\n | 7\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Ghana | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 3\n | +1\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Czech Republic | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | −1\n | 3\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) United States | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 6\n | −4\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n12 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| United States ![](image) | 0–3 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Koller ![](image) 5'\n* Rosický ![](image) 36', 76'\n |\n\nArena AufSchalke, Gelsenkirchen\nAttendance: 52,000\nReferee: Carlos Amarilla (Paraguay)\n\n12 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Italy ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Ghana |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Pirlo ![](image) 40'\n* Iaquinta ![](image) 83'\n | Report |  |\n\nNiedersachsenstadion, Hanover\nAttendance: 43,000\nReferee: Carlos Simon (Brazil)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n17 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| Czech Republic ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image) Ghana |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Gyan ![](image) 2'\n* Muntari ![](image) 82'\n |\n\nRheinEnergieStadion, Cologne\nAttendance: 45,000\nReferee: Horacio Elizondo (Argentina)\n\n17 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Italy ![](image) | 1–1 | ![](image) United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Gilardino ![](image) 22'\n | Report | * Zaccardo ![](image) 27' (o.g.)\n |\n\nFritz-Walter-Stadion, Kaiserslautern\nAttendance: 46,000\nReferee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2006\n16:00\n\n\n| Czech Republic ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image) Italy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Materazzi ![](image) 26'\n* Inzaghi ![](image) 87'\n |\n\nVolksparkstadion, Hamburg\nAttendance: 50,000\nReferee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)\n\n22 June 2006\n16:00\n\n\n| Ghana ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Draman ![](image) 22'\n* Appiah ![](image) 45+2' (pen.)\n | Report | * Dempsey ![](image) 43'\n |\n\nFrankenstadion, Nuremberg\nAttendance: 41,000\nReferee: Markus Merk (Germany)\n\n### Group F[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup Group F\n\nGroup F included the reigning World Champions Brazil, Croatia, Japan, and Australia. Playing in their first World Cup for 32 years, Australia came from behind to defeat Japan 3–1, and, despite losing 0–2 to Brazil, a 2–2 draw with Croatia was enough to give the Australians a place in the Round of 16 in a game where two players were sent-off for second bookings and one, erroneously, for a third booking by English referee Graham Poll. The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in the group. Their 1–0 win against Croatia was through a goal late in the first-half by Kaká. Croatia and Japan went out of the tournament without a single win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Brazil | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n | 1\n | +6\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Australia | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 5\n | 5\n | 0\n | 4\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Croatia | 3\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | −1\n | 2\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Japan | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 7\n | −5\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n12 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| Australia ![](image) | 3–1 | ![](image) Japan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Cahill ![](image) 84', 89'\n* Aloisi ![](image) 90+2'\n | Report | * Nakamura ![](image) 26'\n |\n\nFritz-Walter-Stadion, Kaiserslautern\nAttendance: 46,000\nReferee: Essam Abd El Fatah (Egypt)\n\n13 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Kaká ![](image) 44'\n | Report |  |\n\nOlympiastadion, Berlin\nAttendance: 72,000\nReferee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| Japan ![](image) | 0–0 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nFrankenstadion, Nuremberg\nAttendance: 41,000\nReferee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)\n\n18 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adriano ![](image) 49'\n* Fred ![](image) 90'\n | Report |  |\n\nFIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich\nAttendance: 66,000\nReferee: Markus Merk (Germany)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Japan ![](image) | 1–4 | ![](image) Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Tamada ![](image) 34'\n | Report | * Ronaldo ![](image) 45+1', 81'\n* Juninho ![](image) 53'\n* Gilberto ![](image) 59'\n |\n\nWestfalenstadion, Dortmund\nAttendance: 65,000\nReferee: Éric Poulat (France)\n\n22 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Croatia ![](image) | 2–2 | ![](image) Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Srna ![](image) 2'\n* N.

They were joined by the group winners, Switzerland, who defeated South Korea 2–0, and did not concede a goal in the tournament. South Korea won their first World Cup finals match outside their own country in defeating Togo, but four points were not enough to see them through to the round of 16 (the only team for which this was the case), while Togo exited without a point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)  Switzerland | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 4\n | 0\n | +4\n | 7\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) France | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | 1\n | +2\n | 5\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) South Korea | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 3\n | 4\n | −1\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Togo | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 1\n | 6\n | −5\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n13 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| South Korea ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Togo |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Lee Chun-soo ![](image) 54'\n* Ahn Jung-hwan ![](image) 72'\n | Report | * Kader ![](image) 31'\n |\n\nWaldstadion, Frankfurt\nAttendance: 48,000\nReferee: Graham Poll (England)\n\n13 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 0–0 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nGottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, Stuttgart\nAttendance: 52,000\nReferee: Valentin Ivanov (Russia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 1–1 | ![](image) South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Henry ![](image) 9'\n | Report | * Park Ji-sung ![](image) 81'\n |\n\nZentralstadion, Leipzig\nAttendance: 43,000\nReferee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)\n\n19 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| Togo ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Frei ![](image) 16'\n* Barnetta ![](image) 88'\n |\n\nWestfalenstadion, Dortmund\nAttendance: 65,000\nReferee: Carlos Amarilla (Paraguay)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Togo ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Vieira ![](image) 55'\n* Henry ![](image) 61'\n |\n\nRheinEnergieStadion, Cologne\nAttendance: 45,000\nReferee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay)\n\n23 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Senderos ![](image) 23'\n* Frei ![](image) 77'\n | Report |  |\n\nNiedersachsenstadion, Hanover\nAttendance: 43,000\nReferee: Horacio Elizondo (Argentina)\n\n### Group H[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup Group H\n\nSpain dominated Group H, picking up the maximum number of points, scoring 8 goals, and conceding only 1.

There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were: round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final. There was also a play-off to decide third/fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, a draw was followed by thirty minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves); if scores were still level there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round.\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\nResults decided after extra time are indicated by (a.e.t.), and results decided via a penalty shoot-out are indicated by (p).\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Round of 16 |  | Quarter-finals |  | Semi-finals |  | Final |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 24 June – Munich |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | **![](image) Germany** | **2** |\n|  | 30 June – Berlin |\n|  | ![](image) Sweden | 0\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Germany** (p) | **1 (4)** |\n|  | 24 June – Leipzig |\n|  |  | ![](image) Argentina | 1 (2)\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Argentina** (a.e.t.) | **2** |\n|  |  | 4 July – Dortmund |\n|  | ![](image) Mexico | 1\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Germany | 0 |\n|  | 26 June – Kaiserslautern |\n|  |  | **![](image) Italy** (a.e.t.) | **2** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Italy** | **1** |\n|  | 30 June – Hamburg |  |\n|  | ![](image) Australia | 0\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Italy** | **3** |\n|  | 26 June – Cologne |\n|  |  | ![](image) Ukraine | 0\n |  |\n|  | ![](image)  Switzerland | 0 (0) |\n|  |  | 9 July – Berlin |\n|  | **![](image) Ukraine** (p) | **0 (3)** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Italy** (p) | **1 (5)** |\n|  | 25 June – Stuttgart |\n|  |  | ![](image) France | 1 (3)\n |\n|  | **![](image) England** | **1** |\n|  | 1 July – Gelsenkirchen |  |\n|  | ![](image) Ecuador | 0\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) England | 0 (1) |\n|  | 25 June – Nuremberg |\n|  |  | **![](image) Portugal** (p) | **0 (3)** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Portugal** | **1** |\n|  |  | 5 July – Munich |\n|  | ![](image) Netherlands | 0\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Portugal | 0 |\n|  | 27 June – Dortmund |\n|  |  | **![](image) France** | **1** |  | Third place play-off |\n|  | **![](image) Brazil** | **3** |\n|  | 1 July – Frankfurt |  | 8 July – Stuttgart |\n|  | ![](image) Ghana | 0\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Brazil | 0 | **![](image) Germany** | **3** |\n|  | 27 June – Hanover |\n|  |  | **![](image) France** | **1** |  | ![](image) Portugal | 1\n |\n|  | ![](image) Spain | 1 |\n|  |  |  |\n|  | **![](image) France** | **3** |  |\n|  |\n\n\n### Round of 16[edit]\n\n\nIn the second round, conceding two early goals in the first twelve minutes to Germany effectively ended the Swedes' hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals. Argentina struggled to get past Mexico until a Maxi Rodríguez goal in extra time put the *Albiceleste* in the quarter-finals. Australia's journey ended when Italians were awarded a controversial penalty, scored by Francesco Totti, deep into the remaining seconds of the match. The Italians had spent much of the game with only ten men on the field, following an equally controversial red card shown to centre back Marco Materazzi. In a 0–0 match, described in *The Guardian* as \"the dullest game in World Cup history\",[43] Switzerland failed to convert any of their three penalties in the penalty shoot-out against Ukraine to see them exit the competition with an unwanted new record in becoming the first team in a World Cup to fail to convert any penalties in a shootout. Their elimination also meant that they became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals (and indeed the only nation ever to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal). No two teams from the same group qualified for the quarters, all eight teams were from different groups.\n\n\nEngland struggled against Ecuador but won 1–0 thanks to a David Beckham free kick. Brazil won 3–0 against Ghana, in a game which included Ronaldo's record 15th World Cup goal. *Der Spiegel* reported that the match may have been influenced by an Asian betting syndicate.[44] Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0. The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match, which marked a new World Cup record with 16 yellow cards (Portugal: 9, the Netherlands: 7) and 4 players being sent off for a second bookable offence. France came from behind to defeat Spain 3–1 thanks to goals from Franck Ribéry, Patrick Vieira, and Zinedine Zidane.\n\n\n\n24 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Podolski ![](image) 4', 12'\n | Report |  |\n\nFIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich\nAttendance: 66,000\nReferee: Carlos Simon (Brazil)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n24 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Argentina ![](image) | 2–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Mexico |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Crespo ![](image) 10'\n* Rodríguez ![](image) 98'\n | Report | * Márquez ![](image) 6'\n |\n\nZentralstadion, Leipzig\nAttendance: 43,000\nReferee: Massimo Busacca (Switzerland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n25 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Ecuador |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Beckham ![](image) 60'\n | Report |  |\n\nGottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, Stuttgart\nAttendance: 52,000\nReferee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n25 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Maniche ![](image) 23'\n | Report |  |\n\nFrankenstadion, Nuremberg\nAttendance: 41,000\nReferee: Valentin Ivanov (Russia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n26 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| Italy ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Totti ![](image) 90+5' (pen.)\n | Report |  |\n\nFritz-Walter-Stadion, Kaiserslautern\nAttendance: 46,000\nReferee: Luis Medina Cantalejo (Spain)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n26 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Streller ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Barnetta ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Cabanas ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n | 0–3 | * ![soccer ball with red X](image) Shevchenko\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Milevskyi\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Rebrov\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Husiev\n |\n\nRheinEnergieStadion, Cologne\nAttendance: 45,000\nReferee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 3–0 | ![](image) Ghana |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ronaldo ![](image) 5'\n* Adriano ![](image) 45+1'\n* Zé Roberto ![](image) 84'\n | Report |  |\n\nWestfalenstadion, Dortmund\nAttendance: 65,000\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Spain ![](image) | 1–3 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Villa ![](image) 28' (pen.)\n | Report | * Ribéry ![](image) 41'\n* Vieira ![](image) 83'\n* Zidane ![](image) 90+2'\n |\n\nNiedersachsenstadion, Hanover\nAttendance: 43,000\nReferee: Roberto Rosetti (Italy)\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\nGermany and Argentina ended 1–1 after extra time; the hosts edged out the Argentinians 4–2 on penalties to go through to the semifinals (this was the first time Argentina had lost a World Cup penalty shootout: up until this match, Argentina and Germany had each participated in three penalty shootouts, winning all of them).\n\n\nIn Gelsenkirchen, England faced Portugal in a repeat of their Euro 2004 quarter-final. This time Wayne Rooney was sent off, and Portugal again won on penalties, 3–1 after a 0–0 draw to reach their first World Cup semi-final since the days of Eusébio 40 years earlier. This gave manager Luiz Felipe Scolari his third consecutive tournament quarter-final win over Sven-Göran Eriksson's England, first with Brazil en route to their 2002 World Cup win, then with Portugal in 2004 and 2006.\n\n\nItaly defeated quarter-final debutants Ukraine 3–0. France eliminated Brazil 1–0 to advance into the semi-finals. Brazil only managed one shot on goal, while Zinedine Zidane's dribbling earned him Man of the Match and his free-kick to Thierry Henry resulted in the winning goal.\n\n\n\n30 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Argentina |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Klose ![](image) 80'\n | Report | * Ayala ![](image) 49'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Neuville ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Ballack ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Podolski ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Borowski ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 4–2 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Cruz\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Ayala\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Rodríguez\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Cambiasso\n |\n\nOlympiastadion, Berlin\nAttendance: 72,000\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n30 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Italy ![](image) | 3–0 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Zambrotta ![](image) 6'\n* Toni ![](image) 59', 69'\n | Report |  |\n\nVolksparkstadion, Hamburg\nAttendance: 50,000\nReferee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2006\n17:00\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Portugal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Lampard ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Hargreaves ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Gerrard ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Carragher ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n | 1–3 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Simão\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Viana\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Petit\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Postiga\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Ronaldo\n |\n\nArena AufSchalke, Gelsenkirchen\nAttendance: 52,000\nReferee: Horacio Elizondo (Argentina)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Henry ![](image) 57'\n |\n\nWaldstadion, Frankfurt\nAttendance: 48,000\nReferee: Luis Medina Cantalejo (Spain)\n\n### Semi-finals[edit]\n\n\nWith Argentina and Brazil eliminated in the quarter-finals, an all-European semi-final line up was completed for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\nThe semi-final between Germany and Italy produced an extra time period that went scoreless until the 118th minute, when Italy scored twice through Fabio Grosso and Alessandro Del Piero, putting an end to Germany's undefeated record in Dortmund.\n\n\nIn the second semi-final, Portugal lost to France 1–0 in Munich.

His first goal beat the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo with pace over his head. Only 4 minutes later, Schweinsteiger's free kick 30 metres from the left of the penalty box, driven low across goal, was connected with Petit's knee to become an own goal for Portugal. The German did not stop, and netted his second goal, which swerved away to the keeper's left, in the 78th minute.\n\n\nPortugal were strong in possession but lacked punch in attack; unable to convert 57% possession into goals. Pauleta had two clear chances from 15 metres, but both times hit tame shots that did not trouble keeper Oliver Kahn, who was playing in his last match for the German national team. Portugal got a consolation goal with the help of substitute Luís Figo (also playing the final international game of his career), who almost immediately provided the precise distribution needed to unlock the German defence. A cross from the right wing on 88 minutes found fellow substitute Nuno Gomes at the far post, who dived in for the goal. The game ended 3–1, a result which gave the tournament hosts the bronze medals and left Portugal in fourth place.\n\n\n\n8 July 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 3–1 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Schweinsteiger ![](image) 56', 78'\n* Petit ![](image) 60' (o.g.)\n | Report | * Nuno Gomes ![](image) 88'\n |\n\nGottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, Stuttgart\nAttendance: 52,000\nReferee: Toru Kamikawa (Japan)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup final\n\nThe final started with each side scoring within the first 20 minutes. Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring by converting a controversial seventh-minute penalty kick,[45] which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and bounced beyond the goal line before it spun back up, hit the crossbar again and rebounded out of the goal.[46] Marco Materazzi then levelled the scores in the 19th minute following an Andrea Pirlo corner. Both teams had chances to score the winning goal in normal time: Luca Toni hit the crossbar in the 35th minute for Italy (he later had a header disallowed for offside), while France were not awarded a possible second penalty in the 53rd minute when Florent Malouda went down in the box after a tackle from Gianluca Zambrotta.\n\n\nAt the end of the regulation 90 minutes, the score was still level at 1–1, and the match went into extra time. Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon made a potentially game-saving save in extra time when he tipped a Zidane header over the crossbar. Further controversy ensued near the end of extra time, when Zidane head-butted Materazzi in the chest in an off-the-ball incident and was sent off. Extra time produced no further goals and a penalty shootout followed, which Italy won 5–3. France's David Trezeguet, the man who scored the golden goal against Italy in Euro 2000, was the only player not to score his penalty; his spot kick hit the crossbar, landed on the goal line, and went out. It was the first all-European final since Italy's triumph over West Germany in the 1982 World Cup, and the second final, after 1994, to be decided on penalties. It was also Italy's first world title in 24 years, and their fourth overall, making them the second most successful World Cup team ever. The victory also helped Italy top the FIFA World Rankings in February 2007 for the first time since November 1993.\n\n\n\n9 July 2006\n20:00\n\n\n| Italy ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Materazzi ![](image) 19'\n | Report | * Zidane ![](image) 7' (pen.)\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Pirlo ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Materazzi ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* De Rossi ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Del Piero ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Grosso ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 5–3 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Wiltord\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Trezeguet\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Abidal\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Sagnol\n |\n\nOlympiastadion, Berlin\nAttendance: 69,000\nReferee: Horacio Elizondo (Argentina)\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Goalscorers[edit]\n\n\nMiroslav Klose received the Golden Boot for scoring five goals in the World Cup.

The experience of past World Cups and public viewing was conceptualized in 4-week-long events for football supporters to meet, board, interact, partake in cultural activities and watch all 64 matches on giant video walls. Since 2004, the details on costs, logistics, safety issues, marketing and broadcasting rights were jointly hammered out by FIFA and the host cities.[52] These public viewing events, known as \"Fan Fests\" (German: *Fanmeile*), served an idea to provide football supporters without tickets a legitimate opportunity to partake in the World Cup. Unlike the past tournaments where ticket-less fans were treated as security risks, the World Cup in Germany welcomed all supporters, thus generating positive atmosphere even before the tournament began. Even though security planners and media were sceptical and cautious on the matter of public viewing, the scepticism was cast aside with the beginning of the World Cup.[53]\n\n\nFan Fests for the World Cup were set up in 12 host cities and attracted 21 million visitors over the duration of tournament according to German National Tourist Board (FIFA claimed there were over 18 million visitors).[54][55] The Berlin Fan Fest was located at the pedestrianised Straße des 17. Juni, between Brandenburg Gate and the Victory Column, with 14 consecutive video walls attracted 9 million fans over the duration of World Cup with nearly a million supporters in each match that Germany played. For the first time in German history, an event scored more visitors than Oktoberfest.[56] The Cologne Fan Fest scored 3 million visitors, followed by 1.9 million in Frankfurt, 1.5 million in Stuttgart, 1.46 million in Hamburg, 1 million in Dortmund and Munich, 500,000 in Nuremberg and Hannover, 471,000 in Leipzig, 350,000 in Gelsenkirchen and 205,000 in Kaiserslautern. Those numbers exceeded all expectations and some of the Host Cities had to expand the Fan Fest areas in the middle of the World Cup.[57] The most popular Fan Fests were located in the inner city areas, making the approach to keep the city centre generally \"fan-free\" applied by the authorities of Nuremberg ineffective as many football supporters preferred to stay in the picturesque city centre.[53] According to surveys conducted during the 2006 FIFA World Cup at the Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich Fan Fests, 28% of visitors travelled over 100 kilometres to attend to event and up to 84% came there together with friends. Around 21% of foreigners interviewed at Fan Fests visited Germany to see the World Cup without tickets to any match.[58][59] Media coverage of events had an additional positive effect as pictures of fans celebrating in front of giant screens attracted even more visitors from neighbouring European countries that spontaneously decided to take part in celebrations at Fan Fests.[53]\n\n\nDespite minor inconsistencies in planning and execution, the Fan Fest concept was so successful in fact, numerous people later claimed personal responsibility for the invention.[53] The visitors' expectations regarding Fan Fests were fulfilled. During the World Cup, Fan Fests served as modern market squares where communication and interaction strengthen the feeling of community. Out-of-home media reception made the emotional aspect of escape from everyday life more intense for participants. Pictures of football supporters celebrating in front of video walls became a typical illustration of atmosphere in the country, while \"Fanmeile\" was later picked up as the German Word of the Year.[60] In 2007, FIFA and the 12 host cities received the German Marketing Prize for Sports for the innovative nature and marketing concept of Fan Fests.[61] FIFA and the Host Cities succeeded in creating and comfortable environment for foreign fans as 95% of them surveyed at Fan Fests agreed that it was an unequivocal declaration of international nature of World Cup and not a mere event for Germans.[58] A thought-out implementation of public viewing at such a large-scale football event as the 2006 World Cup became set a precedent.

The team's trainer, Jürgen Klinsmann, in February 2007 was furthermore awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz, not least for his reformed methods of modern training and playing methods, in which he persevered despite harsh criticism. Nevertheless, Klinsmann announced after the tournament that he would not extend his contract as trainer of the national team, since he felt completely burned-out and wished to spend more time with his family in California. The German Football Association (DFB) on the same day named as Klinsmann's successor his assistant trainer Joachim Löw, since in the opinion of the DFB leadership he would best continue Klinsmann's work and training methods.\n\n\nAccording to a representative survey taken in Trier by the European Tourism Institute (ETI), 96% of the German population considered that Germany was a good host during the World Cup. Additionally 93% of those interviewed found the international football fans to be agreeable.[107]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n\n\n* 2006 FIFA World Cup:\n\t+ A time to make friends\n\t+ Broadcasting rights\n\t+ Controversies\n\t+ Disciplinary record\n\t+ Officials\n\t+ Organizing Committee\n\t+ Qualification\n\t+ Seeding\n\t+ Sponsorship\n\t+ Squads\n\t+ FIFA World Cup records\n* Leeuwenhosen controversy\n* *Strangers*, a 2007 film which takes place during the 2006 World Cup\n* *Deutschland.

It was held from 31 May to 30 June 2002 at sites in South Korea and Japan, with its final match hosted by Japan at International Stadium in Yokohama.\n\n\nA field of 32 teams qualified for this World Cup, which was the first to be held in Asia, the first to be held outside of the Americas or Europe, as well as the first to be jointly-hosted by more than one nation. China, Ecuador, Senegal, and Slovenia made their World Cup debuts, with Senegal being the only debutant to qualify the group stages and made it to the quarterfinals.\n\n\nThe tournament had several upsets and surprise results, which included the defending champions France being eliminated in the group stage after earning a single point without scoring a goal and second favourites Argentina also being eliminated in the group stage. South Korea managed to reach the semi-finals, beating Poland, Portugal, Italy and Spain en route. They became the first team from outside of the UEFA, CONMEBOL, and CONCACAF regions and one of the first Asian teams (along with Turkey in this World Cup) to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup. However, the most potent team at the tournament, Brazil, prevailed, winning the final against Germany 2–0, making them the first and only country to have won the World Cup five times.[1] The victory qualified Brazil for the 2003 and subsequently 2005 FIFA Confederations Cups, its fourth and fifth Confederations Cup appearance in a row. In the third place play-off match against South Korea, Turkey won 3–2, taking third place in only their second ever FIFA World Cup, and scored the fastest goal in the FIFA World Cup history (10.8 seconds after kick-off).[2]\n\n\nThe 2002 World Cup was also the last one to use the golden goal rule and the last one to use the same ball for all matches. Starting in 2006 and continuing to the present, a ball with the same technical specifications but different colors has been used in the final.\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts\n\n![](image)Korean Air Boeing 747 adorned with 2002 World Cup livery marking South Korea as co-hosts\n![](image)Japanese 10,000 yen coin for the 2002 FIFA World Cup\nSouth Korea and Japan were selected as hosts by FIFA on 31 May 1996. Initially, South Korea, Japan and Mexico presented three rival bids. South Korea's entry into the race was seen by some as a response to the bid of political and sporting rival Japan.[3] FIFA leaders were split on whom to favor as host as politics within the world governing body held sway.[4] With Mexico regarded as a long shot, the battle to host the tournament came down to South Korea and Japan. The two Asian rivals went on a massive and expensive PR blitz around the world, prompting Sultan Ahmad Shah, the head of the Asian Football Confederation, to step in.[3] FIFA boss João Havelange had long backed the Japanese bid,[4] but his rival in FIFA, UEFA chief Lennart Johansson, sought to undermine Havelange's plans.[4] UEFA and the AFC viewed co-hosting between the two Asian rivals as the best option.[4] South Korea and Japan were finally faced with a choice of having no World Cup or a shared World Cup and they reluctantly chose to go along with co-hosting.[4] South Korea and Japan were chosen unanimously as co-hosts in preference to Mexico.[5] This was the first World Cup to be hosted by more than one country, the second being the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. This is also the first ever World Cup to be hosted in Asia, the other being the 2022 World Cup, hosted by Qatar, twenty years later. The general secretary of South Korea's bidding committee, Song Young-shik, stated that FIFA was interested in staging some matches in North Korea in order to aid Korean reunification, but it was ruled out.[6]\n\n\nAt the time the decision was made, Japan had never qualified for a World Cup finals (although the Japanese did subsequently qualify for the 1998 competition). The only other countries to have been awarded a World Cup without previously having competed in a final tournament are Italy in 1934 and Qatar in 2022 (Uruguay hosted the first World Cup in 1930 so there was no prior tournament; they were defending Olympic champions from 1928).\n\n\nThe unusual choice of host proved an issue for football fans in Europe, used to watching international matches on or close to their time zone.[7] With games taking place in the European morning, some schools and businesses chose to open late on match days or set up communal watching events before the start of work.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\n199 teams attempted to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. The qualification process began with the preliminary draw held in Tokyo on 7 December 1999. Defending champions France and co-hosts South Korea and Japan qualified automatically and did not have to play any qualification matches. This was the final World Cup in which the defending champions qualified automatically.[10]\n\n\n14 places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia) and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and the Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and UEFA and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania). Four nations qualified for the finals for the first time: China, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia. As of 2022, this was the last occasion on which the Republic of Ireland and Turkey qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the only time that China have qualified, as well as the last time that Australia and Switzerland failed to qualify.\n\n\nTurkey qualified for the first time since 1954, Poland and Portugal both qualified for the first time since 1986 and Costa Rica and Uruguay qualified for the first time since 1990. Sweden, Russia and the Republic of Ireland also returned after missing the 1998 World Cup. 1998 semi-finalists the Netherlands, three-time participants in the 1990s Romania and Colombia, and Bulgaria, Morocco and Norway, who had participated in the previous two finals tournaments, alongside Austria, Chile, Iran, Jamaica, Scotland and Yugoslavia which participated in the latest edition, failed to qualify. South Korea set a record by appearing in a fifth successive finals tournament, the first nation from outside Europe or the Americas to achieve this feat.\n\n\nAll seven previous World Cup-winning nations (Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Uruguay) qualified, which broke the record of most previous champions at a tournament before the record was broken again in 2014. The highest ranked team not to qualify for the finals was Colombia (ranked 4th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was China PR (ranked 50th).\n\n\n\n### List of qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings,[11] qualified for the final tournament:\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AFC (4)* ![](image) China (50) (debut)\n* ![](image) Japan (32) (co-hosts)\n* ![](image) Saudi Arabia (34)\n* ![](image) South Korea (40) (co-hosts)\n\nCAF (5)* ![](image) Cameroon (17)\n* ![](image) Nigeria (27)\n* ![](image) Senegal (42) (debut)\n* ![](image) South Africa (37)\n* ![](image) Tunisia (31)\n\nOFC (0)* *None qualified*\n | CONCACAF (3)* ![](image) Costa Rica (29)\n* ![](image) Mexico (7)\n* ![](image) United States (13)\n\nCONMEBOL (5)* ![](image) Argentina (3)\n* ![](image) Brazil (2)\n* ![](image) Ecuador (36) (debut)\n* ![](image) Paraguay (18)\n* ![](image) Uruguay (24)\n | UEFA (15)* ![](image) Belgium (23)\n* ![](image) Croatia (21)\n* ![](image) Denmark (20)\n* ![](image) England (12)\n* ![](image) France (1) (holders)\n* ![](image) Germany (11)\n* ![](image) Italy (6)\n* ![](image) Poland (38)\n* ![](image) Portugal (5)\n* ![](image) Republic of Ireland (15)\n* ![](image) Russia (28)\n* ![](image) Slovenia (25) (debut)\n* ![](image) Spain (8)\n* ![](image) Sweden (19)\n* ![](image) Turkey (22)\n | ![](image)Countries qualified for the World Cup\n Country did not qualify\n Countries that did not enter the World Cup\n Country not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nSouth Korea and Japan each provided 10 venues, the vast majority of them newly built for the tournament. Groups A–D played all their matches in South Korea and Groups E–H played all their matches in Japan.[12] The stadiums in Daegu, Suwon, Yokohama and Saitama all hosted 4 matches each, while the other 16 stadiums hosted 3 matches each. Notably, no matches were played in Tokyo, making it the second capital of a host country not to have a World Cup venue after Bonn of West Germany in 1974.

The historic tradition to seed the hosts (Japan and South Korea) and holders (France) was upheld; while the remaining five seeds were granted to the other five of the top six teams, ranked by their results in the last three FIFA World Cups (ratio 3:2:1) and their FIFA World Ranking position in the last month of the past three years (equal ratio).[37]\n\n\nFor the draw, the 32 teams were allocated into four pots; the eight top-seeded teams, were allocated in pot 1 and would be drawn/selected into the first position of the eight groups playing in the group stage. The remaining 24 unseeded teams, were allocated into three pots based on geographical sections, with the: 11 European teams in pot 2; two Asian teams and three South American teams in pot 3; three North American teams and five African teams in pot 4.[38]\n\n\nThe general principle was to draw one team from each pot into the eight groups, although with special combined procedures for pot 2 and pot 3, due to comprising more/less than eight teams - but sixteen teams in total. At the same time, the draw also needed to respect the geographical limitation, that each group could not feature more than one team from each confederation, except for the European teams where the limitation was maximum two per group. Finally, special limitations were also stipulated to evenly distribute the presence of teams from each confederation between the groups playing respectively in Korea (group A-D) and Japan (group E-H); while China for political considerations only could be drawn for one of the groups playing in Korea.[38]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1Top-seeded teams(DC + hosts + top 5 seeds) | Pot 2Europe(UEFA) | Pot 3Asia & South America(AFC & CONMEBOL) | Pot 4Africa & North America(CAF & CONCACAF) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) France (1998 winner, group A1)\n* ![](image) South Korea (co-hosts, group D1)\n* ![](image) Japan (co-hosts, group H1)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Brazil (1)\n* ![](image) Argentina (2)\n* ![](image) Italy (3)\n* ![](image) Germany (4)\n* ![](image) Spain (6)\n | * ![](image) Belgium\n* ![](image) Croatia\n* ![](image) Denmark\n* ![](image) England\n* ![](image) Poland\n* ![](image) Portugal\n* ![](image) Republic of Ireland\n* ![](image) Russia\n* ![](image) Slovenia\n* ![](image) Sweden\n* ![](image) Turkey\n | * ![](image) China\n* ![](image) Ecuador\n* ![](image) Paraguay\n* ![](image) Saudi Arabia\n* ![](image) Uruguay\n | * ![](image) Cameroon\n* ![](image) Costa Rica\n* ![](image) Mexico\n* ![](image) Nigeria\n* ![](image) Senegal\n* ![](image) South Africa\n* ![](image) Tunisia\n* ![](image) United States\n |\n\n\n* The draw took place at Busan Exhibition and Convention Center in South Korea, and was televised live on 1 December 2001: World Cup Draw 2002 on RTÉ.\n\n\nThe FIFA Organising Committee decided ahead of the draw, to place the defending champions (France) in Group A; while the co-hosts South Korea and Japan were placed respectively in Group D and Group H. The procedure for the draw comprised the following six steps:[38][39]\n\n\n\n1. Pot 1 was used to draw, in alphabetic group order, the remaining five top-seeded teams for the first position of groups B, C, E, F and G; while respecting the restriction that one of the two South American seeds (Brazil and Argentina) had to play in a group played in South Korea (B/C) and the other had to play in a group played in Japan (E/F/G).\n2. Pot 2 was used to draw one European team to each of the eight groups (drawing unrestricted in the alphabetic order from A to H).\n3. As per the FIFA rule of only allowing a maximum of two European teams in each group, the remaining three European teams from Pot 2, was subject to a second draw, to be put in either of the four groups containing a top-seeded South American team or Asian team. This was done by first drawing the European team from Pot 2, and then drawing which seeded opponent the European team should be paired with, from a special bowl with four blue balls containing the names of Brazil, Argentina, Japan and South Korea.\n4. Pot 3 was used to draw one team to each of the five groups with an empty third slot (drawing in alphabetical order from A to H); while respecting the geographical restrictions, that:\n\t1. None of the unseeded South American teams (Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay) from pot 3, could be drawn into a group with a seeded South American team (Brazil and Argentina).\n\t2. None of the unseeded Asian teams (Saudi Arabia and China) from pot 3, could be drawn into a group with a seeded Asian team (South Korea and Japan in Group D and H); along with the overall rule that China had to play in South Korea (meaning either group A, B or C) and that Saudi Arabia had to play in Japan (meaning either group E, F or G).\n5. Pot 4 was used to draw one team to each of the eight groups (drawing in the alphabetic order from A to H); while respecting the restrictions that:\n\t1. Minimum one North American team and minimum two African teams should be drawn to a group located in South Korea (Group A/B/C/D)\n\t2. Minimum one North American team and minimum two African teams should be drawn to a group located in Japan (Group E/F/G/H)\n6. To decide the match schedules, the exact group position number for the un-seeded teams in each group (2, 3 or 4), were also drawn immediately from eight special group bowls, after each respective team had been drawn from pot 2, 3 and 4.\n\n\nBesides of drawing the teams, the event also featured American vocalist Anastacia giving a debut public performance of the official song of the World Cup: Boom.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Draw results and group fixtures[edit]\n\n\nThe draw resulted in the following eight groups:[39]\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup A (Korea)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) France |\n| A2 | ![](image) Senegal |\n| A3 | ![](image) Uruguay |\n| A4 | ![](image) Denmark |\n\n\n\n\nGroup B (Korea)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Spain |\n| B2 | ![](image) Slovenia |\n| B3 | ![](image) Paraguay |\n| B4 | ![](image) South Africa |\n\n\n\n\nGroup C (Korea)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Brazil |\n| C2 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| C3 | ![](image) China |\n| C4 | ![](image) Costa Rica |\n\n\n\n\nGroup D (Korea)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) South Korea |\n| D2 | ![](image) Poland |\n| D3 | ![](image) United States |\n| D4 | ![](image) Portugal |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup E (Japan)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| E1 | ![](image) Germany |\n| E2 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia |\n| E3 | ![](image) Republic of Ireland |\n| E4 | ![](image) Cameroon |\n\n\n\n\nGroup F (Japan)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| F1 | ![](image) Argentina |\n| F2 | ![](image) Nigeria |\n| F3 | ![](image) England |\n| F4 | ![](image) Sweden |\n\n\n\n\nGroup G (Japan)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| G1 | ![](image) Italy |\n| G2 | ![](image) Ecuador |\n| G3 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| G4 | ![](image) Mexico |\n\n\n\n\nGroup H (Japan)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| H1 | ![](image) Japan |\n| H2 | ![](image) Belgium |\n| H3 | ![](image) Russia |\n| H4 | ![](image) Tunisia |\n\n\nIn each group, the teams played three matches, one against each of the other teams. Victories were granted 3 points, while a draw was equal to 1 point. After completion of the Group stage, the best two teams of each group advanced to the Round of 16 in the knockout stage, in a way so all group winners started out meeting a runner-up from one of the other groups. This format was identical with the tournament structure being used in 1998. A total of 64 games were played, including the final and a bronze medal game between the two semifinale losers.\n\n\nGroup F was considered the group of death, as it brought together Argentina, England, Nigeria and Sweden.[40]\n\n\nThe fixtures for the Group stage were decided based on the draw results, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup stage schedule\n| Matchday\n | Dates\n | Matches\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Matchday 1\n | 31 May – 5 June 2002\n | 1 v 2, 3 v 4\n |\n| Matchday 2\n | 5–10 June 2002\n | 1 v 3, 4 v 2\n |\n| Matchday 3\n | 11–14 June 2002\n | 4 v 1, 2 v 3\n |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n*All times are Korea Standard Time and Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)*\n\n\n\n![](image)|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Champion\n Runner-up\n | Third place\n Fourth place\n | Quarter-finals\n Round of 16\n | Group stage\n |\n\nGroups A, B, C and D based in South Korea.

The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria.[42]\n\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup Group A\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Denmark | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 2\n | +3\n | 7\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Senegal | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 5\n | 4\n | +1\n | 5\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Uruguay | 3\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n | 5\n | −1\n | 2\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) France | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | −3\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n31 May 2002\n20:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) Senegal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | Bouba Diop ![](image) 30' |\n\nSeoul World Cup Stadium, Seoul\nAttendance: 62,561\nReferee: Ali Bujsaim (United Arab Emirates)\n\n1 June 2002\n18:00 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Uruguay ![](image) | 1–2 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rodríguez ![](image) 47' | Report | Tomasson ![](image) 45', 83' |\n\nMunsu Football Stadium, Ulsan\nAttendance: 30,157\nReferee: Saad Mane (Kuwait)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n6 June 2002\n15:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Denmark ![](image) | 1–1 | ![](image) Senegal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tomasson ![](image) 16' (pen.) | Report | Diao ![](image) 52' |\n\nDaegu World Cup Stadium, Daegu\nAttendance: 43,500\nReferee: Carlos Batres (Guatemala)\n\n6 June 2002\n20:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 0–0 | ![](image) Uruguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nBusan Asiad Main Stadium, Busan\nAttendance: 38,289\nReferee: Felipe Ramos (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n11 June 2002\n15:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Denmark ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rommedahl ![](image) 22'Tomasson ![](image) 67' | Report |  |\n\nIncheon Munhak Stadium, Incheon\nAttendance: 48,100\nReferee: Vítor Melo Pereira (Portugal)\n\n11 June 2002\n15:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Senegal ![](image) | 3–3 | ![](image) Uruguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Fadiga ![](image) 20' (pen.)Bouba Diop ![](image) 26', 38' | Report | Morales ![](image) 46'Forlán ![](image) 69'Recoba ![](image) 88' (pen.) |\n\nSuwon World Cup Stadium, Suwon\nAttendance: 33,681\nReferee: Jan Wegereef (Netherlands)\n\n### Group B[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup Group B\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Spain | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 9\n | 4\n | +5\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Paraguay | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 6\n | 6\n | 0\n | 4\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) South Africa | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 5\n | 5\n | 0\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Slovenia | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 2\n | 7\n | −5\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n2 June 2002\n16:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Paraguay ![](image) | 2–2 | ![](image) South Africa |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Santa Cruz ![](image) 39'Arce ![](image) 55' | Report | T.

England defeated Denmark in Niigata 3–0, with all goals occurring in the first half of the game. Sweden and Senegal faced off in Ōita and finished 1–1 in regular time and it took a golden goal from Henri Camara in extra time to settle the game for Senegal 2–1, which lead to Senegal becoming only the second African team to reach the last eight (after Cameroon in 1990). Spain and the Republic of Ireland played in Suwon, where Spain led most of the match 1–0 until a late penalty kick scored by Robbie Keane made the match go to extra time, where Spain emerged victorious in a penalty shoot-out. The United States beat CONCACAF rivals Mexico 2–0 in Jeonju with Brian McBride and Landon Donovan scoring the goals. Brazil defeated Belgium 2–0 in Kobe, with an amazing volley by Rivaldo and a splendid counter-attack goal by Ronaldo. Turkey ended co-hosts Japan's run with a 1–0 win in Miyagi, thanks to an Ümit Davala goal in the 12th minute. The other co-hosts, South Korea, defeated Italy 2–1 in extra time in Daejeon with a goal by Ahn Jung-hwan in the 117th minute.[43] South Korea's win ensured that, for the very first time in the Cup's history, teams from five continents – Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Asia – reached the quarter-finals of the same tournament.\n\n\n\n15 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Paraguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Neuville ![](image) 88' | Report |  |\n\nJeju World Cup Stadium, Seogwipo\nAttendance: 25,176\nReferee: Carlos Alberto Batres (Guatemala)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Denmark ![](image) | 0–3 | ![](image) England |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | Ferdinand ![](image) 5'Owen ![](image) 22'Heskey ![](image) 44' |\n\nBig Swan Stadium, Niigata\nAttendance: 40,582\nReferee: Markus Merk (Germany)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n16 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Sweden ![](image) | 1–2 (a.e.t./g.g.) | ![](image) Senegal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Larsson ![](image) 11' | Report | Camara ![](image) 37', ![gold-colored soccer ball](image) 104'  |\n\nBig Eye Stadium, Ōita\nAttendance: 39,747\nReferee: Ubaldo Aquino (Paraguay)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n16 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Spain ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Republic of Ireland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Morientes ![](image) 8' | Report | Robbie Keane ![](image) 90' (pen.) |\n| Penalties |\n| Hierro ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Baraja ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Juanfran ![soccer ball with red X](image)Valerón ![soccer ball with red X](image)Mendieta ![soccer ball with check mark](image) | 3–2 | ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Robbie Keane![soccer ball with red X](image) Holland![soccer ball with red X](image) Connolly![soccer ball with red X](image) Kilbane![soccer ball with check mark](image) Finnan |\n\nSuwon World Cup Stadium, Suwon\nAttendance: 38,926\nReferee: Anders Frisk (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n17 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Mexico ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image) United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | McBride ![](image) 8'Donovan ![](image) 65' |\n\nJeonju World Cup Stadium, Jeonju\nAttendance: 36,380\nReferee: Vítor Melo Pereira (Portugal)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n17 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Belgium |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rivaldo ![](image) 67'Ronaldo ![](image) 87' | Report |  |\n\nKobe Wing Stadium, Kobe\nAttendance: 40,440\nReferee: Peter Prendergast (Jamaica)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Japan ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | Ümit Davala ![](image) 12' |\n\nMiyagi Stadium, Rifu\nAttendance: 45,666\nReferee: Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| South Korea ![](image) | 2–1 (a.e.t./g.g.) | ![](image) Italy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Seol Ki-Hyeon ![](image) 88'Ahn Jung-Hwan ![gold-colored soccer ball](image) 117'  | Report | Vieri ![](image) 18' |\n\nDaejeon World Cup Stadium, Daejeon\nAttendance: 38,588\nReferee: Byron Moreno (Ecuador)\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\nIn the quarter-finals, England and Brazil squared off in Shizuoka, where Ronaldinho scored a free-kick goal over England's David Seaman early in the second half as Brazil won 2–1.[44] The United States lost to Germany 1–0 in Ulsan by a Michael Ballack goal in the 39th minute, but controversy surrounded the game when United States demanded the referee give a penalty for a goal-line handball by Torsten Frings in the 49th minute, but the referee did not award the penalty. South Korea got another success in Gwangju in a controversial manner, overcoming Spain 5–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw in which the Spaniards twice thought they had scored while onside; however, the efforts were disallowed by the referee with controversial decisions.[45][46] While the decisions were marginal, in both incidents the Korean players stopped playing after seeing the flag raised, allowing the goals to be scored. The hosts became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, eclipsing the record of their North Korean counterparts who reached the quarter-finals in 1966. They also became the first World Cup semi-final team not from UEFA or CONMEBOL since the United States did it in the first World Cup in 1930. Turkey defeated Senegal 1–0 in Osaka, with a golden goal scored by İlhan Mansız in the 94th minute.\n\n\n\n21 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–2 | ![](image) Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Owen ![](image) 23' | Report | Rivaldo ![](image) 45+2'Ronaldinho ![](image) 50' |\n\nStadium Ecopa, Shizuoka\nAttendance: 47,436\nReferee: Felipe Ramos (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n21 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ballack ![](image) 39' | Report |  |\n\nMunsu Football Stadium, Ulsan\nAttendance: 37,337\nReferee: Hugh Dallas (Scotland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Spain ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| Hierro ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Baraja ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Xavi ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Joaquín ![soccer ball with red X](image) | 3–5 | ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Hwang Sun-hong![soccer ball with check mark](image) Park Ji-sung![soccer ball with check mark](image) Seol Ki-hyeon![soccer ball with check mark](image) Ahn Jung-hwan![soccer ball with check mark](image) Hong Myung-bo |\n\nGwangju World Cup Stadium, Gwangju\nAttendance: 42,114\nReferee: Gamal Al-Ghandour (Egypt)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Senegal ![](image) | 0–1 (a.e.t./g.g.) | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | İlhan ![gold-colored soccer ball](image) 94'  |\n\nNagai Stadium, Osaka\nAttendance: 44,233\nReferee: Óscar Ruiz (Colombia)\n\n### Semi-finals[edit]\n\n\nThe semi-finals saw two 1–0 games; the first semi-final, played in Seoul, saw Michael Ballack's goal suffice for Germany to eliminate South Korea. However, Ballack had already received a yellow card during the match before, which forced him to miss the final based on accumulated yellow cards.[47] The next day in Saitama saw Ronaldo score a goal early in the second half, his sixth of the competition for Brazil, to defeat Turkey in a replay of their Group C encounter.[48][49]\n\n\n\n25 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ballack ![](image) 75' | Report |  |\n\nSeoul World Cup Stadium, Seoul\nAttendance: 65,256\nReferee: Urs Meier (Switzerland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n26 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ronaldo ![](image) 49' | Report |  |\n\nSaitama Stadium, Saitama\nAttendance: 61,058\nReferee: Kim Milton Nielsen (Denmark)\n\n### Third place play-off[edit]\n\n\nIn the third-place match in Daegu, Turkey beat the South Koreans 3–2, their first goal coming from Hakan Şükür straight from the opening kick-off (even though South Korea kicked off) in 10.8 seconds, the fastest ever goal in World Cup history.[50]\n\n\n\n29 June 2002\n20:00\n\n\n| South Korea ![](image) | 2–3 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lee Eul-yong ![](image) 9'Song Chong-gug ![](image) 90+3' | Report | Şükür ![](image) 1'İlhan ![](image) 13', 32' |\n\nDaegu World Cup Stadium, Daegu\nAttendance: 63,483\nReferee: Saad Mane (Kuwait)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup final\n\nIn the final match held in Yokohama, Japan, two goals from Ronaldo secured the World Cup for Brazil as they claimed victory over Germany.[51] Ronaldo scored twice in the second half and, after the game, won the Golden Shoe award for the tournament's leading scorer with eight goals.[52] This was the fifth time Brazil had won the World Cup, cementing their status as the most successful national team in the history of the competition. Brazil became the only team since Argentina in 1986 to win the trophy without needing to win a penalty shoot-out at some stage during the knockout phase and the total number of penalty shoot-outs (2) was the lowest since the four-round knockout format was introduced in 1986. Brazil also became the first team to win every match at a World Cup since 1970 and set a new record for highest aggregate goal difference (+14) for a World Cup winner. Brazil's captain Cafu, who became the first player to appear in three successive World Cup finals, accepted the trophy on behalf of the team.\n\n\n\n30 June 2002\n20:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image) Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | Ronaldo ![](image) 67', 79' |\n\nInternational Stadium Yokohama, Yokohama\nAttendance: 69,029\nReferee: Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Goalscorers[edit]\n\n\nRonaldo won the Golden Shoe after scoring eight goals.

Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA World Cup Sponsors and South Korea and Japan Supporters.[58][59]\n\n\n\n\n\n| List of sponsors for the tournament\n |\n| --- |\n| FIFA World Cup sponsors |

Insurance\n |\n\n\n### Ticket sales problem[edit]\n\n\nThe original domestic ticket allocation had fully sold out and the organising committee completed sales of tickets returned from the international allocation by the end of April. However, there were a significant number of empty seats at the opening matches.[75] It was gradually revealed that the World Cup Ticketing Bureau (WCTB) still had unsold tickets in its possession. After FIFA agreed to sell this inventory, JAWOC undertook sales over telephone and WCTB handled the internet sales.[76] For the second round Japan vs. Turkey match in Miyagi in particular, although it was reported by both parties that all tickets had been sold, some 700 seats remained empty.\n\n\n\n## Symbols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ato, Kaz and Nik were the 2002 World Cup mascots.\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe official mascot of this World Cup was \"Ato, Kaz, and Nik\" (The Spheriks), orange, purple, and blue (respectively) futuristic, computer-generated creatures. Collectively, members of a team of \"Atmosball\" (a fictional football-like sport), Ato is the coach while Kaz and Nik are players. The three individual names were selected from shortlists by users on the Internet and at McDonald's outlets in the host countries.[77]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Fevernova\n\nThe official match ball was \"Fevernova\", manufactured by Adidas.[78]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe official song was \"Boom\".[79] The official local song of this World Cup was \"Let's Get Together Now\". The official anthem was \"Anthem\".\n\n\n\n## Cultural event[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*In Search of Fresh Air*. Banner by Ray L. Burggraf.\nThe official FIFA cultural event of the 2002 World Cup was a flag festival called *Poetry of the Winds*.[80] Held in Nanjicheon Park, an area of the World Cup Park close to Seoul World Cup Stadium,[81][82] *Poetry of the Winds* was exhibited from 29 May to 25 June in order to wish success upon the World Cup and promote a festive atmosphere. During the flag art festival, hand-painted flags from global artists were displayed as a greeting to international guests in a manner that was designed to promote harmony (2002 Flag Art Festival Executive Committee).[80]\n\n\n\n## Concerns[edit]\n\n\nThe World Cup was originally going to be hosted either in Japan or in South Korea, but in the end both rivals had decided to share the hosting duties thus making this World Cup the first to have multiple host nations. However, there were concerns regarding the selection of hosts due to logistical issues caused by fans traveling across two separate sovereign nations as well as whether some of the 20 stadiums to be constructed for the World Cup would be ready in time for it or not. While political and infrastructural problems were eventually overcome, there still remained the issue of East Asia's wet season which could disrupt the play. The timing of the tournament thus had been altered to mitigate as much as possible against such issues, with the tournament kicking off on May 31 and due to run until June 30, the earliest date for a World Cup final since 1986.[83]\n\n\nThe time difference caused issues for fans worldwide especially in Europe, where people had to go to work when matches were played.[84]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath and legacy[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament had a major economic impact on both South Korea and Japan, generating an estimated US$1.3 billion in revenue.[85] Spending from World Cup tourists in South Korea created US$307 million in direct income and US$713 million in valued added.[85] Japan spent an estimated US$5.6 billion on preparations for the event, which had a US$24.8 billion impact on the Japanese economy and accounted for 0.6% of their GDP in 2002.[86]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n* ![flag](image)South Korea portal\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* 2002 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n* Adidas Fevernova – match ball\n* *The Official Album of the 2002 FIFA World Cup*\n* *The Doraemons* movies: *Goal!

It was held from 31 May to 30 June 2002 at sites in South Korea and Japan, with its final match hosted by Japan at International Stadium in Yokohama.\n\n\nA field of 32 teams qualified for this World Cup, which was the first to be held in Asia, the first to be held outside of the Americas or Europe, as well as the first to be jointly-hosted by more than one nation. China, Ecuador, Senegal, and Slovenia made their World Cup debuts, with Senegal being the only debutant to qualify the group stages and made it to the quarterfinals.\n\n\nThe tournament had several upsets and surprise results, which included the defending champions France being eliminated in the group stage after earning a single point without scoring a goal and second favourites Argentina also being eliminated in the group stage. South Korea managed to reach the semi-finals, beating Poland, Portugal, Italy and Spain en route. They became the first team from outside of the UEFA, CONMEBOL, and CONCACAF regions and one of the first Asian teams (along with Turkey in this World Cup) to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup. However, the most potent team at the tournament, Brazil, prevailed, winning the final against Germany 2–0, making them the first and only country to have won the World Cup five times.[1] The victory qualified Brazil for the 2003 and subsequently 2005 FIFA Confederations Cups, its fourth and fifth Confederations Cup appearance in a row. In the third place play-off match against South Korea, Turkey won 3–2, taking third place in only their second ever FIFA World Cup, and scored the fastest goal in the FIFA World Cup history (10.8 seconds after kick-off).[2]\n\n\nThe 2002 World Cup was also the last one to use the golden goal rule and the last one to use the same ball for all matches. Starting in 2006 and continuing to the present, a ball with the same technical specifications but different colors has been used in the final.\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts\n\n![](image)Korean Air Boeing 747 adorned with 2002 World Cup livery marking South Korea as co-hosts\n![](image)Japanese 10,000 yen coin for the 2002 FIFA World Cup\nSouth Korea and Japan were selected as hosts by FIFA on 31 May 1996. Initially, South Korea, Japan and Mexico presented three rival bids. South Korea's entry into the race was seen by some as a response to the bid of political and sporting rival Japan.[3] FIFA leaders were split on whom to favor as host as politics within the world governing body held sway.[4] With Mexico regarded as a long shot, the battle to host the tournament came down to South Korea and Japan. The two Asian rivals went on a massive and expensive PR blitz around the world, prompting Sultan Ahmad Shah, the head of the Asian Football Confederation, to step in.[3] FIFA boss João Havelange had long backed the Japanese bid,[4] but his rival in FIFA, UEFA chief Lennart Johansson, sought to undermine Havelange's plans.[4] UEFA and the AFC viewed co-hosting between the two Asian rivals as the best option.[4] South Korea and Japan were finally faced with a choice of having no World Cup or a shared World Cup and they reluctantly chose to go along with co-hosting.[4] South Korea and Japan were chosen unanimously as co-hosts in preference to Mexico.[5] This was the first World Cup to be hosted by more than one country, the second being the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. This is also the first ever World Cup to be hosted in Asia, the other being the 2022 World Cup, hosted by Qatar, twenty years later. The general secretary of South Korea's bidding committee, Song Young-shik, stated that FIFA was interested in staging some matches in North Korea in order to aid Korean reunification, but it was ruled out.[6]\n\n\nAt the time the decision was made, Japan had never qualified for a World Cup finals (although the Japanese did subsequently qualify for the 1998 competition). The only other countries to have been awarded a World Cup without previously having competed in a final tournament are Italy in 1934 and Qatar in 2022 (Uruguay hosted the first World Cup in 1930 so there was no prior tournament; they were defending Olympic champions from 1928).\n\n\nThe unusual choice of host proved an issue for football fans in Europe, used to watching international matches on or close to their time zone.[7] With games taking place in the European morning, some schools and businesses chose to open late on match days or set up communal watching events before the start of work.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\n199 teams attempted to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. The qualification process began with the preliminary draw held in Tokyo on 7 December 1999. Defending champions France and co-hosts South Korea and Japan qualified automatically and did not have to play any qualification matches. This was the final World Cup in which the defending champions qualified automatically.[10]\n\n\n14 places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia) and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and the Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and UEFA and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania). Four nations qualified for the finals for the first time: China, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia. As of 2022, this was the last occasion on which the Republic of Ireland and Turkey qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the only time that China have qualified, as well as the last time that Australia and Switzerland failed to qualify.\n\n\nTurkey qualified for the first time since 1954, Poland and Portugal both qualified for the first time since 1986 and Costa Rica and Uruguay qualified for the first time since 1990. Sweden, Russia and the Republic of Ireland also returned after missing the 1998 World Cup. 1998 semi-finalists the Netherlands, three-time participants in the 1990s Romania and Colombia, and Bulgaria, Morocco and Norway, who had participated in the previous two finals tournaments, alongside Austria, Chile, Iran, Jamaica, Scotland and Yugoslavia which participated in the latest edition, failed to qualify. South Korea set a record by appearing in a fifth successive finals tournament, the first nation from outside Europe or the Americas to achieve this feat.\n\n\nAll seven previous World Cup-winning nations (Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Uruguay) qualified, which broke the record of most previous champions at a tournament before the record was broken again in 2014. The highest ranked team not to qualify for the finals was Colombia (ranked 4th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was China PR (ranked 50th).\n\n\n\n### List of qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings,[11] qualified for the final tournament:\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AFC (4)* ![](image) China (50) (debut)\n* ![](image) Japan (32) (co-hosts)\n* ![](image) Saudi Arabia (34)\n* ![](image) South Korea (40) (co-hosts)\n\nCAF (5)* ![](image) Cameroon (17)\n* ![](image) Nigeria (27)\n* ![](image) Senegal (42) (debut)\n* ![](image) South Africa (37)\n* ![](image) Tunisia (31)\n\nOFC (0)* *None qualified*\n | CONCACAF (3)* ![](image) Costa Rica (29)\n* ![](image) Mexico (7)\n* ![](image) United States (13)\n\nCONMEBOL (5)* ![](image) Argentina (3)\n* ![](image) Brazil (2)\n* ![](image) Ecuador (36) (debut)\n* ![](image) Paraguay (18)\n* ![](image) Uruguay (24)\n | UEFA (15)* ![](image) Belgium (23)\n* ![](image) Croatia (21)\n* ![](image) Denmark (20)\n* ![](image) England (12)\n* ![](image) France (1) (holders)\n* ![](image) Germany (11)\n* ![](image) Italy (6)\n* ![](image) Poland (38)\n* ![](image) Portugal (5)\n* ![](image) Republic of Ireland (15)\n* ![](image) Russia (28)\n* ![](image) Slovenia (25) (debut)\n* ![](image) Spain (8)\n* ![](image) Sweden (19)\n* ![](image) Turkey (22)\n | ![](image)Countries qualified for the World Cup\n Country did not qualify\n Countries that did not enter the World Cup\n Country not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nSouth Korea and Japan each provided 10 venues, the vast majority of them newly built for the tournament. Groups A–D played all their matches in South Korea and Groups E–H played all their matches in Japan.[12] The stadiums in Daegu, Suwon, Yokohama and Saitama all hosted 4 matches each, while the other 16 stadiums hosted 3 matches each. Notably, no matches were played in Tokyo, making it the second capital of a host country not to have a World Cup venue after Bonn of West Germany in 1974.

Of the 23 players, three must be goalkeepers.\n\n\n\n## Draw[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2002 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\nThe FIFA Organising Committee announced the eight seeded teams on 28 November 2001. The historic tradition to seed the hosts (Japan and South Korea) and holders (France) was upheld; while the remaining five seeds were granted to the other five of the top six teams, ranked by their results in the last three FIFA World Cups (ratio 3:2:1) and their FIFA World Ranking position in the last month of the past three years (equal ratio).[37]\n\n\nFor the draw, the 32 teams were allocated into four pots; the eight top-seeded teams, were allocated in pot 1 and would be drawn/selected into the first position of the eight groups playing in the group stage. The remaining 24 unseeded teams, were allocated into three pots based on geographical sections, with the: 11 European teams in pot 2; two Asian teams and three South American teams in pot 3; three North American teams and five African teams in pot 4.[38]\n\n\nThe general principle was to draw one team from each pot into the eight groups, although with special combined procedures for pot 2 and pot 3, due to comprising more/less than eight teams - but sixteen teams in total. At the same time, the draw also needed to respect the geographical limitation, that each group could not feature more than one team from each confederation, except for the European teams where the limitation was maximum two per group. Finally, special limitations were also stipulated to evenly distribute the presence of teams from each confederation between the groups playing respectively in Korea (group A-D) and Japan (group E-H); while China for political considerations only could be drawn for one of the groups playing in Korea.[38]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1Top-seeded teams(DC + hosts + top 5 seeds) | Pot 2Europe(UEFA) | Pot 3Asia & South America(AFC & CONMEBOL) | Pot 4Africa & North America(CAF & CONCACAF) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) France (1998 winner, group A1)\n* ![](image) South Korea (co-hosts, group D1)\n* ![](image) Japan (co-hosts, group H1)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Brazil (1)\n* ![](image) Argentina (2)\n* ![](image) Italy (3)\n* ![](image) Germany (4)\n* ![](image) Spain (6)\n | * ![](image) Belgium\n* ![](image) Croatia\n* ![](image) Denmark\n* ![](image) England\n* ![](image) Poland\n* ![](image) Portugal\n* ![](image) Republic of Ireland\n* ![](image) Russia\n* ![](image) Slovenia\n* ![](image) Sweden\n* ![](image) Turkey\n | * ![](image) China\n* ![](image) Ecuador\n* ![](image) Paraguay\n* ![](image) Saudi Arabia\n* ![](image) Uruguay\n | * ![](image) Cameroon\n* ![](image) Costa Rica\n* ![](image) Mexico\n* ![](image) Nigeria\n* ![](image) Senegal\n* ![](image) South Africa\n* ![](image) Tunisia\n* ![](image) United States\n |\n\n\n* The draw took place at Busan Exhibition and Convention Center in South Korea, and was televised live on 1 December 2001: World Cup Draw 2002 on RTÉ.\n\n\nThe FIFA Organising Committee decided ahead of the draw, to place the defending champions (France) in Group A; while the co-hosts South Korea and Japan were placed respectively in Group D and Group H. The procedure for the draw comprised the following six steps:[38][39]\n\n\n\n1. Pot 1 was used to draw, in alphabetic group order, the remaining five top-seeded teams for the first position of groups B, C, E, F and G; while respecting the restriction that one of the two South American seeds (Brazil and Argentina) had to play in a group played in South Korea (B/C) and the other had to play in a group played in Japan (E/F/G).\n2. Pot 2 was used to draw one European team to each of the eight groups (drawing unrestricted in the alphabetic order from A to H).\n3. As per the FIFA rule of only allowing a maximum of two European teams in each group, the remaining three European teams from Pot 2, was subject to a second draw, to be put in either of the four groups containing a top-seeded South American team or Asian team. This was done by first drawing the European team from Pot 2, and then drawing which seeded opponent the European team should be paired with, from a special bowl with four blue balls containing the names of Brazil, Argentina, Japan and South Korea.\n4. Pot 3 was used to draw one team to each of the five groups with an empty third slot (drawing in alphabetical order from A to H); while respecting the geographical restrictions, that:\n\t1. None of the unseeded South American teams (Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay) from pot 3, could be drawn into a group with a seeded South American team (Brazil and Argentina).\n\t2. None of the unseeded Asian teams (Saudi Arabia and China) from pot 3, could be drawn into a group with a seeded Asian team (South Korea and Japan in Group D and H); along with the overall rule that China had to play in South Korea (meaning either group A, B or C) and that Saudi Arabia had to play in Japan (meaning either group E, F or G).\n5. Pot 4 was used to draw one team to each of the eight groups (drawing in the alphabetic order from A to H); while respecting the restrictions that:\n\t1. Minimum one North American team and minimum two African teams should be drawn to a group located in South Korea (Group A/B/C/D)\n\t2. Minimum one North American team and minimum two African teams should be drawn to a group located in Japan (Group E/F/G/H)\n6. To decide the match schedules, the exact group position number for the un-seeded teams in each group (2, 3 or 4), were also drawn immediately from eight special group bowls, after each respective team had been drawn from pot 2, 3 and 4.\n\n\nBesides of drawing the teams, the event also featured American vocalist Anastacia giving a debut public performance of the official song of the World Cup: Boom.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Draw results and group fixtures[edit]\n\n\nThe draw resulted in the following eight groups:[39]\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup A (Korea)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) France |\n| A2 | ![](image) Senegal |\n| A3 | ![](image) Uruguay |\n| A4 | ![](image) Denmark |\n\n\n\n\nGroup B (Korea)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Spain |\n| B2 | ![](image) Slovenia |\n| B3 | ![](image) Paraguay |\n| B4 | ![](image) South Africa |\n\n\n\n\nGroup C (Korea)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Brazil |\n| C2 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| C3 | ![](image) China |\n| C4 | ![](image) Costa Rica |\n\n\n\n\nGroup D (Korea)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) South Korea |\n| D2 | ![](image) Poland |\n| D3 | ![](image) United States |\n| D4 | ![](image) Portugal |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup E (Japan)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| E1 | ![](image) Germany |\n| E2 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia |\n| E3 | ![](image) Republic of Ireland |\n| E4 | ![](image) Cameroon |\n\n\n\n\nGroup F (Japan)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| F1 | ![](image) Argentina |\n| F2 | ![](image) Nigeria |\n| F3 | ![](image) England |\n| F4 | ![](image) Sweden |\n\n\n\n\nGroup G (Japan)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| G1 | ![](image) Italy |\n| G2 | ![](image) Ecuador |\n| G3 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| G4 | ![](image) Mexico |\n\n\n\n\nGroup H (Japan)\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| H1 | ![](image) Japan |\n| H2 | ![](image) Belgium |\n| H3 | ![](image) Russia |\n| H4 | ![](image) Tunisia |\n\n\nIn each group, the teams played three matches, one against each of the other teams. Victories were granted 3 points, while a draw was equal to 1 point. After completion of the Group stage, the best two teams of each group advanced to the Round of 16 in the knockout stage, in a way so all group winners started out meeting a runner-up from one of the other groups. This format was identical with the tournament structure being used in 1998. A total of 64 games were played, including the final and a bronze medal game between the two semifinale losers.\n\n\nGroup F was considered the group of death, as it brought together Argentina, England, Nigeria and Sweden.[40]\n\n\nThe fixtures for the Group stage were decided based on the draw results, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup stage schedule\n| Matchday\n | Dates\n | Matches\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Matchday 1\n | 31 May – 5 June 2002\n | 1 v 2, 3 v 4\n |\n| Matchday 2\n | 5–10 June 2002\n | 1 v 3, 4 v 2\n |\n| Matchday 3\n | 11–14 June 2002\n | 4 v 1, 2 v 3\n |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n*All times are Korea Standard Time and Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)*\n\n\n\n![](image)|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Champion\n Runner-up\n | Third place\n Fourth place\n | Quarter-finals\n Round of 16\n | Group stage\n |\n\nGroups A, B, C and D based in South Korea. Groups E, F, G and H based in Japan.\n\n\nIn the following tables:\n\n\n\n* **Pld** = total games played\n* **W** = total games won\n* **D** = total games drawn (tied)\n* **L** = total games lost\n* **GF** = total goals scored (goals for)\n* **GA** = total goals conceded (goals against)\n* **GD** = goal difference (GF−GA)\n* **Pts** = total points accumulated\n\n\nThe teams in the group play were ranked upon\n\n\n\n* Points\n* Greatest total goal difference in the three group matches\n* Greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches\n* Most points earned in matches against other teams in the tie\n* Greatest goal difference in matches against other teams in the tie\n* Greatest number of goals scored in matches against other teams in the tie\n* Drawing of lots\n\n\nIn the original version of the rules for the final tournament, the ranking criteria were in a different order, with head-to-head results taking precedence over total goal difference. The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria.[42]\n\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup Group A\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Denmark | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 2\n | +3\n | 7\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Senegal | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 5\n | 4\n | +1\n | 5\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Uruguay | 3\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n | 5\n | −1\n | 2\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) France | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | −3\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n31 May 2002\n20:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) Senegal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | Bouba Diop ![](image) 30' |\n\nSeoul World Cup Stadium, Seoul\nAttendance: 62,561\nReferee: Ali Bujsaim (United Arab Emirates)\n\n1 June 2002\n18:00 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Uruguay ![](image) | 1–2 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rodríguez ![](image) 47' | Report | Tomasson ![](image) 45', 83' |\n\nMunsu Football Stadium, Ulsan\nAttendance: 30,157\nReferee: Saad Mane (Kuwait)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n6 June 2002\n15:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Denmark ![](image) | 1–1 | ![](image) Senegal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tomasson ![](image) 16' (pen.) | Report | Diao ![](image) 52' |\n\nDaegu World Cup Stadium, Daegu\nAttendance: 43,500\nReferee: Carlos Batres (Guatemala)\n\n6 June 2002\n20:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 0–0 | ![](image) Uruguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nBusan Asiad Main Stadium, Busan\nAttendance: 38,289\nReferee: Felipe Ramos (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n11 June 2002\n15:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Denmark ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rommedahl ![](image) 22'Tomasson ![](image) 67' | Report |  |\n\nIncheon Munhak Stadium, Incheon\nAttendance: 48,100\nReferee: Vítor Melo Pereira (Portugal)\n\n11 June 2002\n15:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Senegal ![](image) | 3–3 | ![](image) Uruguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Fadiga ![](image) 20' (pen.)Bouba Diop ![](image) 26', 38' | Report | Morales ![](image) 46'Forlán ![](image) 69'Recoba ![](image) 88' (pen.) |\n\nSuwon World Cup Stadium, Suwon\nAttendance: 33,681\nReferee: Jan Wegereef (Netherlands)\n\n### Group B[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup Group B\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Spain | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 9\n | 4\n | +5\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Paraguay | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 6\n | 6\n | 0\n | 4\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) South Africa | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 5\n | 5\n | 0\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Slovenia | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 2\n | 7\n | −5\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n2 June 2002\n16:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Paraguay ![](image) | 2–2 | ![](image) South Africa |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Santa Cruz ![](image) 39'Arce ![](image) 55' | Report | T.

England defeated Denmark in Niigata 3–0, with all goals occurring in the first half of the game. Sweden and Senegal faced off in Ōita and finished 1–1 in regular time and it took a golden goal from Henri Camara in extra time to settle the game for Senegal 2–1, which lead to Senegal becoming only the second African team to reach the last eight (after Cameroon in 1990). Spain and the Republic of Ireland played in Suwon, where Spain led most of the match 1–0 until a late penalty kick scored by Robbie Keane made the match go to extra time, where Spain emerged victorious in a penalty shoot-out. The United States beat CONCACAF rivals Mexico 2–0 in Jeonju with Brian McBride and Landon Donovan scoring the goals. Brazil defeated Belgium 2–0 in Kobe, with an amazing volley by Rivaldo and a splendid counter-attack goal by Ronaldo. Turkey ended co-hosts Japan's run with a 1–0 win in Miyagi, thanks to an Ümit Davala goal in the 12th minute. The other co-hosts, South Korea, defeated Italy 2–1 in extra time in Daejeon with a goal by Ahn Jung-hwan in the 117th minute.[43] South Korea's win ensured that, for the very first time in the Cup's history, teams from five continents – Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Asia – reached the quarter-finals of the same tournament.\n\n\n\n15 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Paraguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Neuville ![](image) 88' | Report |  |\n\nJeju World Cup Stadium, Seogwipo\nAttendance: 25,176\nReferee: Carlos Alberto Batres (Guatemala)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Denmark ![](image) | 0–3 | ![](image) England |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | Ferdinand ![](image) 5'Owen ![](image) 22'Heskey ![](image) 44' |\n\nBig Swan Stadium, Niigata\nAttendance: 40,582\nReferee: Markus Merk (Germany)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n16 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Sweden ![](image) | 1–2 (a.e.t./g.g.) | ![](image) Senegal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Larsson ![](image) 11' | Report | Camara ![](image) 37', ![gold-colored soccer ball](image) 104'  |\n\nBig Eye Stadium, Ōita\nAttendance: 39,747\nReferee: Ubaldo Aquino (Paraguay)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n16 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Spain ![](image) | 1–1 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Republic of Ireland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Morientes ![](image) 8' | Report | Robbie Keane ![](image) 90' (pen.) |\n| Penalties |\n| Hierro ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Baraja ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Juanfran ![soccer ball with red X](image)Valerón ![soccer ball with red X](image)Mendieta ![soccer ball with check mark](image) | 3–2 | ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Robbie Keane![soccer ball with red X](image) Holland![soccer ball with red X](image) Connolly![soccer ball with red X](image) Kilbane![soccer ball with check mark](image) Finnan |\n\nSuwon World Cup Stadium, Suwon\nAttendance: 38,926\nReferee: Anders Frisk (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n17 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Mexico ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image) United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | McBride ![](image) 8'Donovan ![](image) 65' |\n\nJeonju World Cup Stadium, Jeonju\nAttendance: 36,380\nReferee: Vítor Melo Pereira (Portugal)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n17 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Belgium |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rivaldo ![](image) 67'Ronaldo ![](image) 87' | Report |  |\n\nKobe Wing Stadium, Kobe\nAttendance: 40,440\nReferee: Peter Prendergast (Jamaica)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Japan ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | Ümit Davala ![](image) 12' |\n\nMiyagi Stadium, Rifu\nAttendance: 45,666\nReferee: Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| South Korea ![](image) | 2–1 (a.e.t./g.g.) | ![](image) Italy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Seol Ki-Hyeon ![](image) 88'Ahn Jung-Hwan ![gold-colored soccer ball](image) 117'  | Report | Vieri ![](image) 18' |\n\nDaejeon World Cup Stadium, Daejeon\nAttendance: 38,588\nReferee: Byron Moreno (Ecuador)\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\nIn the quarter-finals, England and Brazil squared off in Shizuoka, where Ronaldinho scored a free-kick goal over England's David Seaman early in the second half as Brazil won 2–1.[44] The United States lost to Germany 1–0 in Ulsan by a Michael Ballack goal in the 39th minute, but controversy surrounded the game when United States demanded the referee give a penalty for a goal-line handball by Torsten Frings in the 49th minute, but the referee did not award the penalty. South Korea got another success in Gwangju in a controversial manner, overcoming Spain 5–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw in which the Spaniards twice thought they had scored while onside; however, the efforts were disallowed by the referee with controversial decisions.[45][46] While the decisions were marginal, in both incidents the Korean players stopped playing after seeing the flag raised, allowing the goals to be scored. The hosts became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, eclipsing the record of their North Korean counterparts who reached the quarter-finals in 1966. They also became the first World Cup semi-final team not from UEFA or CONMEBOL since the United States did it in the first World Cup in 1930. Turkey defeated Senegal 1–0 in Osaka, with a golden goal scored by İlhan Mansız in the 94th minute.\n\n\n\n21 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–2 | ![](image) Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Owen ![](image) 23' | Report | Rivaldo ![](image) 45+2'Ronaldinho ![](image) 50' |\n\nStadium Ecopa, Shizuoka\nAttendance: 47,436\nReferee: Felipe Ramos (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n21 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ballack ![](image) 39' | Report |  |\n\nMunsu Football Stadium, Ulsan\nAttendance: 37,337\nReferee: Hugh Dallas (Scotland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Spain ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| Hierro ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Baraja ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Xavi ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Joaquín ![soccer ball with red X](image) | 3–5 | ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Hwang Sun-hong![soccer ball with check mark](image) Park Ji-sung![soccer ball with check mark](image) Seol Ki-hyeon![soccer ball with check mark](image) Ahn Jung-hwan![soccer ball with check mark](image) Hong Myung-bo |\n\nGwangju World Cup Stadium, Gwangju\nAttendance: 42,114\nReferee: Gamal Al-Ghandour (Egypt)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Senegal ![](image) | 0–1 (a.e.t./g.g.) | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | İlhan ![gold-colored soccer ball](image) 94'  |\n\nNagai Stadium, Osaka\nAttendance: 44,233\nReferee: Óscar Ruiz (Colombia)\n\n### Semi-finals[edit]\n\n\nThe semi-finals saw two 1–0 games; the first semi-final, played in Seoul, saw Michael Ballack's goal suffice for Germany to eliminate South Korea. However, Ballack had already received a yellow card during the match before, which forced him to miss the final based on accumulated yellow cards.[47] The next day in Saitama saw Ronaldo score a goal early in the second half, his sixth of the competition for Brazil, to defeat Turkey in a replay of their Group C encounter.[48][49]\n\n\n\n25 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ballack ![](image) 75' | Report |  |\n\nSeoul World Cup Stadium, Seoul\nAttendance: 65,256\nReferee: Urs Meier (Switzerland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n26 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ronaldo ![](image) 49' | Report |  |\n\nSaitama Stadium, Saitama\nAttendance: 61,058\nReferee: Kim Milton Nielsen (Denmark)\n\n### Third place play-off[edit]\n\n\nIn the third-place match in Daegu, Turkey beat the South Koreans 3–2, their first goal coming from Hakan Şükür straight from the opening kick-off (even though South Korea kicked off) in 10.8 seconds, the fastest ever goal in World Cup history.[50]\n\n\n\n29 June 2002\n20:00\n\n\n| South Korea ![](image) | 2–3 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lee Eul-yong ![](image) 9'Song Chong-gug ![](image) 90+3' | Report | Şükür ![](image) 1'İlhan ![](image) 13', 32' |\n\nDaegu World Cup Stadium, Daegu\nAttendance: 63,483\nReferee: Saad Mane (Kuwait)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup final\n\nIn the final match held in Yokohama, Japan, two goals from Ronaldo secured the World Cup for Brazil as they claimed victory over Germany.[51] Ronaldo scored twice in the second half and, after the game, won the Golden Shoe award for the tournament's leading scorer with eight goals.[52] This was the fifth time Brazil had won the World Cup, cementing their status as the most successful national team in the history of the competition. Brazil became the only team since Argentina in 1986 to win the trophy without needing to win a penalty shoot-out at some stage during the knockout phase and the total number of penalty shoot-outs (2) was the lowest since the four-round knockout format was introduced in 1986. Brazil also became the first team to win every match at a World Cup since 1970 and set a new record for highest aggregate goal difference (+14) for a World Cup winner. Brazil's captain Cafu, who became the first player to appear in three successive World Cup finals, accepted the trophy on behalf of the team.\n\n\n\n30 June 2002\n20:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image) Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | Ronaldo ![](image) 67', 79' |\n\nInternational Stadium Yokohama, Yokohama\nAttendance: 69,029\nReferee: Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Goalscorers[edit]\n\n\nRonaldo won the Golden Shoe after scoring eight goals.

Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA World Cup Sponsors and South Korea and Japan Supporters.[58][59]\n\n\n\n\n\n| List of sponsors for the tournament\n |\n| --- |\n| FIFA World Cup sponsors | South Korea sponsors | Japan sponsors\n |\n| * Adidas[60]\n* Avaya[61][62]\n* Budweiser[63]\n* Coca-Cola[64]\n* Fuji Xerox[65]\n* Fujifilm[66]\n* Gillette\n* Duracell\n* Hyundai[67]\n* JVC\n*

Insurance\n |\n\n\n### Ticket sales problem[edit]\n\n\nThe original domestic ticket allocation had fully sold out and the organising committee completed sales of tickets returned from the international allocation by the end of April. However, there were a significant number of empty seats at the opening matches.[75] It was gradually revealed that the World Cup Ticketing Bureau (WCTB) still had unsold tickets in its possession. After FIFA agreed to sell this inventory, JAWOC undertook sales over telephone and WCTB handled the internet sales.[76] For the second round Japan vs. Turkey match in Miyagi in particular, although it was reported by both parties that all tickets had been sold, some 700 seats remained empty.\n\n\n\n## Symbols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ato, Kaz and Nik were the 2002 World Cup mascots.\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe official mascot of this World Cup was \"Ato, Kaz, and Nik\" (The Spheriks), orange, purple, and blue (respectively) futuristic, computer-generated creatures. Collectively, members of a team of \"Atmosball\" (a fictional football-like sport), Ato is the coach while Kaz and Nik are players. The three individual names were selected from shortlists by users on the Internet and at McDonald's outlets in the host countries.[77]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Fevernova\n\nThe official match ball was \"Fevernova\", manufactured by Adidas.[78]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe official song was \"Boom\".[79] The official local song of this World Cup was \"Let's Get Together Now\". The official anthem was \"Anthem\".\n\n\n\n## Cultural event[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*In Search of Fresh Air*. Banner by Ray L. Burggraf.\nThe official FIFA cultural event of the 2002 World Cup was a flag festival called *Poetry of the Winds*.[80] Held in Nanjicheon Park, an area of the World Cup Park close to Seoul World Cup Stadium,[81][82] *Poetry of the Winds* was exhibited from 29 May to 25 June in order to wish success upon the World Cup and promote a festive atmosphere. During the flag art festival, hand-painted flags from global artists were displayed as a greeting to international guests in a manner that was designed to promote harmony (2002 Flag Art Festival Executive Committee).[80]\n\n\n\n## Concerns[edit]\n\n\nThe World Cup was originally going to be hosted either in Japan or in South Korea, but in the end both rivals had decided to share the hosting duties thus making this World Cup the first to have multiple host nations. However, there were concerns regarding the selection of hosts due to logistical issues caused by fans traveling across two separate sovereign nations as well as whether some of the 20 stadiums to be constructed for the World Cup would be ready in time for it or not. While political and infrastructural problems were eventually overcome, there still remained the issue of East Asia's wet season which could disrupt the play. The timing of the tournament thus had been altered to mitigate as much as possible against such issues, with the tournament kicking off on May 31 and due to run until June 30, the earliest date for a World Cup final since 1986.[83]\n\n\nThe time difference caused issues for fans worldwide especially in Europe, where people had to go to work when matches were played.[84]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath and legacy[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament had a major economic impact on both South Korea and Japan, generating an estimated US$1.3 billion in revenue.[85] Spending from World Cup tourists in South Korea created US$307 million in direct income and US$713 million in valued added.[85] Japan spent an estimated US$5.6 billion on preparations for the event, which had a US$24.8 billion impact on the Japanese economy and accounted for 0.6% of their GDP in 2002.[86]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n* ![flag](image)South Korea portal\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* 2002 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n* Adidas Fevernova – match ball\n* *The Official Album of the 2002 FIFA World Cup*\n* *The Doraemons* movies: *Goal!
