Accessible worldwide,[7] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website in the world, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users,[8] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos every day.[9] As of May 2019[update], videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[10][11]\n\n\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[12] Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a greater audience.\n\n\nYouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite its growth and success, it has been widely criticized for allegedly facilitating the spread of misinformation and the sharing of copyrighted content, routinely violating its users' privacy, enabling censorship, endangering child safety and wellbeing, and for its inconsistent or incorrect implementation of platform guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of YouTube\n\n### Founding and initial growth (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, the founders of YouTube.\nYouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay.[14] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[15]\n\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[16]\n\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[17] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[16][18] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[19] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)The YouTube logo used from its launch until 2007;[*citation needed*] it returned in 2008 before being removed again in 2010.[*citation needed*] Another version of this logo without the \"Broadcast Yourself\" slogan was used until 2011.\nYouTube began as a venture capital–funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two.[14][21] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[22] In February 2005, the company activated `www.youtube.com`.[23] The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\nYouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was launched in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor.[31] The week of YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's *Saturday Night Live* ran a skit \"Lazy Sunday\" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for *Saturday Night Live*, \"Lazy Sunday\"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website.[32] Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns.[33] Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content.[34][35] The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[36]\n\n\nThe choice of the name `www.youtube.com` led to problems for a similarly named website, `www.utube.com`. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to `www.utubeonline.com`.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast Yourself era (2006–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California\nOn October 9, 2006, Google announced that it had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock.[39][40] The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[41][42] Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube.[31] It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself\".\nThe company experienced rapid growth. *The Daily Telegraph* wrote that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000.[43] By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos, according to comScore.[44] That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site.[45] In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every minute.[46][47][48] However, most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[49] That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red.[50][51] A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013.[52] By that point, more than 100 hours were being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014.[53][54]\n\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo from 2015 until 2017\nDuring this time, the company also went through some organizational changes. In October 2006, YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno, California.[55] Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as a chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company in October 2010.[56]\n\n\nIn December 2009, YouTube partnered with Vevo.[57] In April 2010, Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" became the most viewed video, becoming the first video to reach 200 million views on May 9, 2010.[58]\n\n\n\n### Susan Wojcicki and going mainstream (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo since 2017\nSusan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014.[59] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million. The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees.[60] YouTube officially launched the \"polymer\" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017.[61]\n\n\nThrough this period, YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond advertisements. In 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium, subscription-based channels.[62][63] This effort was discontinued in January 2018 and relaunched in June, with US$4.99 channel subscriptions.[64][65] These channel subscriptions complemented the existing Super Chat ability, launched in 2017, which allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment highlighted.[66] In 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as \"Music Key,\" which bundled ad-free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[67] The service continued to evolve in 2015 when YouTube announced YouTube Red, a new premium service that would offer ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year), premium original series, and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform.[68][69][70]\n\n\nThe company also attempted to create products appealing to specific viewers. YouTube released a mobile app known as YouTube Kids in 2015, designed to provide an experience optimized for children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control features.[71] Also in 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[72]\n\n\nThe company was attacked on April 3, 2018, when a shooting occurred at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California, which wounded four and resulted in the death of the shooter.[73]\n\n\n\n### Recent history (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\nBy February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute.[9][74] Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than 500 hours per minute.[10] During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-at-home orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased. One data firm[*which?*] estimated that YouTube was accounting for 15% of all internet traffic, twice its pre-pandemic level.[75] In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix stated they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's request.[76] YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.\"[77]\n\n\nFollowing a 2018 complaint alleging violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),[78] the company was fined $170 million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of 13.[79] YouTube was also ordered to create systems to increase children's privacy.[80][81] Following criticisms of its implementation of those systems, YouTube started treating all videos designated as \"made for kids\" as liable under COPPA on January 6, 2020.[82][83] Joining the YouTube Kids app, the company created a supervised mode, designed more for tweens, in 2021.[84] Additionally, to compete with TikTok, YouTube released YouTube Shorts, a short-form video platform.\n\n\nDuring this period, YouTube entered disputes with other tech companies. For over a year, in 2018 and 2019, no YouTube app was available for Amazon Fire products.[85] In 2020, Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement.[86]\n\n\nAfter testing earlier in 2021, YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November 2021, claiming the reason for the removal was, based on its internal research, that users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading.[87] While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls, others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as \"a stupid idea\", and that the real reason behind the change was \"not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed.\" He felt that users' ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential, saying, \"The process works, and there's a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines.\"[88][89][90] Shortly after the announcement, software developer Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike, an open-source, third-party browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video's number of dislikes.[91] In a letter published on January 25, 2022, by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, acknowledged that removing public dislike counts was a controversial decision, but reiterated that she stands by this decision, claiming that \"it reduced dislike attacks.\"[92]\n\n\nIn 2022, YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts, intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video. Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads, YouTube \"ended\" the experiment on September 19 of that year.[93] In October, YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles (e.g. @MrBeast6000) in addition to channel names, which would also become channel URLs.[94]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor. Wojcicki will take on an advisory role for Google and parent company Alphabet.[95]\n\n\nIn late October 2023, YouTube began cracking down on the use of ad blockers on the platform. Users of ad blockers may be given a pop-up warning saying \"Video player will be blocked after 3 videos\". Users of ad blockers are shown a message inviting them to subscribe to YouTube Premium. YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service.[96][97]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and held the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023.[95] The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023.[95]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Video technology[edit]\n\n\nYouTube primarily uses the VP9 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video codecs, and the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP protocol.[98] MPEG-4 Part 2 streams contained within 3GP containers are also provided for low bandwidth connections.[99] By January 2019, YouTube had begun rolling out videos in AV1 format.[100] In 2021 it was reported that the company was considering requiring AV1 in streaming hardware in order to decrease bandwidth and increase quality.[101] Video is usually streamed alongside the Opus and AAC audio codecs.[99]\n\n\nAt launch in 2005, viewing YouTube videos on a personal computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to be installed in the browser.[102] In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of Web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard.[103] This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed.[104] On January 27, 2015, YouTube announced that HTML5 would be the default playback method on supported browsers.[103] HTML5 video streams use Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), an HTTP-based adaptive bit-rate streaming solution optimizes the bitrate and quality for the available network.[105]\n\n\nThe platform can serve videos at optionally lower resolution levels starting at 144p for smoothening playback in areas and countries with limited Internet speeds, improving compatibility, as well as for the preservation of limited cellular data plans. The resolution can be adjusted automatically based on detected connection speed or set manually.[106][107]\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2017, users could add \"annotations\" to their videos, such as pop-up text messages and hyperlinks, which allowed for interactive videos. By 2019 all annotations had been removed from videos, breaking some videos that depended on the feature. YouTube introduced standardized widgets intended to replace annotations in a cross-platform manner, including \"end screens\" (a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video).[108][109][110]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube became an International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) registry, and announced its intention to begin creating ISNI identifiers to uniquely identify the musicians whose videos it features.[111]\n\n\nUsers can verify their account, normally through a mobile phone, to gain the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as produce live streams.[112][113] Users who have built sufficient channel history and have a good track record of complying with the site's Community Guidelines will also gain access to these aforementioned features as well.[114] When YouTube was launched in 2005, it was possible to upload longer videos, but a 10-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films.[115] The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010.[116] Videos can be at most 256 GB in size or 12 hours, whichever is less.[112] As of 2021[update], automatic closed captions using speech recognition technology when a video is uploaded are available in 13 languages, and can be machine-translated during playback.[117]\n\n\nYouTube also offers manual closed captioning as part of its creator studio.[118] YouTube formerly offered a 'Community Captions' feature, where viewers could write and submit captions for public display upon approval by the video uploader, but this was deprecated in September 2020.[119]\n\n\nYouTube accepts the most common container formats, including MP4, Matroska, FLV, AVI, WebM, 3GP, MPEG-PS, and the QuickTime File Format. Some intermediate video formats (i.e., primarily used for professional video editing, not for final delivery or storage) are also accepted, such as ProRes.[120] YouTube provides recommended encoding settings.[121]\n\n\nEach video is identified by an eleven-character case-sensitive alphanumerical Base64 string in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which can contain letters, digits, an underscore (`_`), and a dash (`-`).[122]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube added a feature called *Premiere* which displays a notification to the user mentioning when the video will be available for the first time, like for a live stream but with a prerecorded video. When the scheduled time arrives, the video is aired as a live broadcast with a two-minute countdown. Optionally, a premiere can be initiated immediately.[123]\n\n\n\n#### Quality and formats[edit]\n\n\nYouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320×240 pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec (a variant of H.263),[124][125] with mono MP3 audio.[126] In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3GP format on mobile phones.[127] In March 2008, a high-quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480×360 pixels.[128] In December 2008, 720p HD support was added. At the time of the 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9.[129] With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format. In November 2009, 1080p HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels.[130][131] In July 2010, support for 4K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 3840 × 2160 pixels.[132] In June 2015, support for 8K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels.[133] In November 2016, support for HDR video was added which can be encoded with hybrid log–gamma (HLG) or perceptual quantizer (PQ).[134] HDR video can be encoded with the Rec. 2020 color space.[135]\n\n\nIn June 2014, YouTube began to deploy support for high frame rate videos up to 60 frames per second (as opposed to 30 before), becoming available for user uploads in October. YouTube stated that this would enhance \"motion-intensive\" videos, such as video game footage.[136][137][138][139]\n\n\nYouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. Viewers only indirectly influence the video quality. In the mobile apps, users choose between \"Auto\", which adjusts resolution based on the internet connection, \"High Picture Quality\" which will prioritize playing high-quality video, \"Data saver\" which will sacrifice video quality in favor of low data usage and \"Advanced\" which lets the user choose a stream resolution.[140] On desktop, users choose between \"Auto\" and a specific resolution.[141] It is not possible for the viewer to directly choose a higher bitrate (quality) for any selected resolution.\n\n\nSince 2009, viewers have had the ability to watch 3D videos.[142] In 2015, YouTube began natively supporting 360-degree video. Since April 2016, it allowed live streaming 360° video, and both normal and 360° video at up to 1440p, and since November 2016 both at up to 4K (2160p) resolution.[143][144][145] Citing the limited number of users who watched more than 90-degrees, it began supporting an alternative stereoscopic video format known as VR180 which it said was easier to produce,[146] which allows users to watch any video using virtual reality headsets.[147]\n\n\nIn response to increased viewership during the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube temporarily downgraded the quality of its videos.[148][149] YouTube developed its own chip, called Argos, to help with encoding higher resolution videos in 2021.[150]\n\n\nIn certain cases, YouTube allows the uploader to upgrade the quality of videos uploaded a long time ago in poor quality. One such partnership with Universal Music Group included remasters of 1,000 music videos.[151]\n\n\n\n#### Live streaming[edit]\n\n\nYouTube carried out early experiments with live streaming, including its YouTube Live event in 2008,[152] a concert by U2 in 2009, and a question-and-answer session with US President Barack Obama in February 2010.[153] These tests had relied on technology from 3rd-party partners, but in September 2010, YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure.[154] In April 2011, YouTube announced the rollout of *YouTube Live*. The creation of live streams was initially limited to select partners.[155] It was used for real-time broadcasting of events such as the 2012 Olympics in London.[156] In October 2012, more than 8 million people watched Felix Baumgartner's jump from the edge of space as a live stream on YouTube.[157]\n\n\nIn May 2013, creation of live streams was opened to verified users with at least 1,000 subscribers; in August of the same year the number was reduced to 100 subscribers,[158] and in December the limit was removed.[159] In February 2017, live streaming was introduced to the official YouTube mobile app. Live streaming via mobile was initially restricted to users with at least 10,000 subscribers,[160] but as of mid-2017 it has been reduced to 100 subscribers.[161] Live streams support HDR, can be up to 4K resolution at 60 fps, and also support 360° video.[144][162]\n\n\n\n### User features[edit]\n\n\n#### Comment system [edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google § YouTube user comments\n\nMost videos enable users to leave comments, which have attracted attention for the negative aspects of their form and content.[*specify*] In 2006, *Time* praised Web 2.0 for enabling \"community and collaboration on a scale never seen before\", and added that YouTube \"harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred\".[163] *The Guardian* in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as:[164]\n\n\n\n\n> Juvenile, aggressive, misspelt, sexist, homophobic, swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL, YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance—with the occasional burst of wit shining through.\n> \n> \n\n\n*The Daily Telegraph* commented in September 2008, that YouTube was \"notorious\" for \"some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet\", and reported on YouTube Comment Snob, \"a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts\".[165] *The Huffington Post* noted in April 2012 that finding comments on YouTube that appear \"offensive, stupid and crass\" to the \"vast majority\" of the people is hardly difficult.[166]\n\n\nGoogle subsequently implemented a comment system oriented on Google+ on November 6, 2013, that required all YouTube users to use a Google+ account to comment on videos. The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone.[167] The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse.[168][169] In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change.[170] The official YouTube announcement[171] received 20,097 \"thumbs down\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.[172] Writing in the *Newsday* blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network like Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\" and added that \"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with the outcry against the new comment system\". In the same article Melvin goes on to say:[173]\n\n\n\n\n> Perhaps user complaints are justified, but the idea of revamping the old system isn't so bad.\n> Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation. Isn't any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot? The system is far from perfect, but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity.\n> \n> \n\n\nLater, on July 27, 2015, Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google+ account to post comments to YouTube.[174] On November 3, 2016, YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve, hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments.[175] Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam. They can also allow other users to moderate their comments.[176]\n\n\nIn December 2020, it was reported that YouTube would launch a new feature that will warn users who post a comment that \"may be offensive to others.\"[177][178]\n\n\n\n#### Community[edit]\n\n\nOn September 13, 2016, YouTube launched a public beta of Community, a social media-based feature that allows users to post text, images (including GIFs), live videos and others in a separate \"Community\" tab on their channel.[179] Prior to the release, several creators had been consulted to suggest tools Community could incorporate that they would find useful; these YouTubers included Vlogbrothers, AsapScience, Lilly Singh, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons, Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger and Vsauce3.[180][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nAfter the feature has been officially released, the *community post* feature gets activated automatically for every channel that passes a specific threshold of subscriber counts or already has more subscribers. This threshold was lowered over time,[*when?*] from 10,000 subscribers to 1500 subscribers, to 1000 subscribers,[181][*non-primary source needed*] to 500 subscribers.[182]\n\n\nChannels that the community tab becomes enabled for, get their channel discussions (previously known as channel comments) permanently erased, instead of co-existing or migrating.[183][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n#### TestTube[edit]\n\n\nExperimental features of YouTube can be accessed in an area of the site named *TestTube*.[184][185]\n\n\nFor example, in October 2009, a *comment search* feature accessible under `/comment_search` was implemented as part of this program. The feature was removed later.[186]\n\n\nLater the same year, *YouTube Feather* was introduced as a \"lightweight\" alternative website for countries with limited internet speeds.[187]\n\n\n\n### Content accessibility[edit]\n\n\nYouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web.[188] This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by, or related to another user's video can make a \"video response\". The eleven character YouTube video identifier (64 possible characters used in each position), allows for a theoretical maximum of 6411 or around 73.8 quintillion (73.8 billion billion) unique ids.\n\n\nYouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature on August 27, 2013.[189] Embedding, rating, commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner.[190] YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos, and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface.[191] A small number of videos can be downloaded as MP4 files.[192] Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos.[193]\n\n\nIn February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout.[194] In June 2012, Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos.[195] In response, Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site.[196] Users retain copyright of their own work under the default Standard YouTube License,[197] but have the option to grant certain usage rights under any public copyright license they choose.\n\n\nSince July 2012, it has been possible to select a Creative Commons attribution license as the default, allowing other users to reuse and remix the material.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Platforms[edit]\n\n\nMost modern smartphones are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video.[199] Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.[200]\n\n\nSince June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone.[201]\n\n\nThe mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 in July 2010, avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls.[202] The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform.[203][204]\n\n\nIn September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system.[205] According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third-most used app.[206]\n\n\nA TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos.[207]\n\n\nIn January 2009, YouTube launched \"YouTube for TV\", a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers, initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles.[208][209]\n\n\nDuring the month of June that same year, YouTube XL was introduced, which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen.[210] YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live.[211]\n\n\nOn November 15, 2012, Google launched an official app for the Wii, allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel.[212] An app was available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, but was discontinued in August 2019.[213] Videos can also be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5.[214][*non-primary source needed*] Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17, 2013,[215] and, in October 2014, the Sony PlayStation 4.[216]\n\n\nYouTube launched as a downloadable app for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018.[217]\n\n\n\n### International and localization[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt appeared in Paris to launch the new localization system.[218] The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 104 countries, one territory (Hong Kong) and a worldwide version.[219]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

chosen based on the IP address of the user. In some cases, the message \"This video is not available in your country\" may appear because of copyright restrictions or inappropriate content.[268] The interface of the YouTube website is available in 76 language versions, including Amharic, Albanian, Armenian, Burmese, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Persian and Uzbek, which do not have local channel versions. Access to YouTube was blocked in Turkey between 2008 and 2010, following controversy over the posting of videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and some material offensive to Muslims.[269][270] In October 2012, a local version of YouTube was launched in Turkey, with the domain `youtube.com.tr`. The local version is subject to the content regulations found in Turkish law.[271] In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British royalty collection agency PRS for Music led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach an agreement on a licensing deal. The dispute was resolved in September 2009.[272] In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany.[273]\n\n\n\n## Videos[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television.[274] In 2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by *The Daily Dot* that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. This was disputed by *Billboard*, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.[276][277] On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behaviour which caused a video's view count to freeze at \"301\" (later \"301+\") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.[278] YouTube view counts once again updated in real time.[279]\n\n\nSince September 2019, subscriber counts are abbreviated. Only three leading digits of channels' subscriber counts are indicated publicly, compromising the function of third-party real-time indicators such as that of Social Blade. Exact counts remain available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio.[280]\n\n\nOn November 11, 2021, after testing out this change in March of the same year, YouTube announced it would start hiding dislike counts on videos, making them invisible to viewers. The company stated the decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment. Creators will still be able to see the number of likes and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool, according to YouTube.[281][282][283]\n\n\n\n### Copyright issues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube copyright issues\n\nFurther information: § Revenue to copyright holders\n\nYouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns.[32] At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws.[284] Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted.[285][286] From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.[287][288][289]\n\n\nIn August 2008, a US court ruled in *Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.* that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material.[290] YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply.[291]\n\n\nIn the 2011 case of *Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC*, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube.[292] He asserted seven causes of action, and four were ruled in Smith's favor.[293] In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users.[294] On November 1, 2016, the dispute with GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA.[295]\n\n\nIn April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice.[296][297] As part of YouTube Music, Universal and YouTube signed an agreement in 2017, which was followed by separate agreements other major labels, which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube.[298] By 2019, creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video, with different levels of enforcement depending on the record label.[299] Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use.[299]\n\n\n\n#### Content ID[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Content ID (system)\n\nIn June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute.[300] The system, which was initially called \"Video Identification\"[301][302] and later became known as Content ID,[303] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[304] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.\n\n\nAn independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was \"surprisingly resilient\" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.[305] The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.[306] If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.[307]\n\n\nBefore 2016, videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved. Since April 2016, videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute.[308] Should the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the \"Video Manager\".[309] YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.[310]\n\n\n\n### Moderation and offensive content[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google § YouTube, and Censorship by Google § YouTube\n\nYouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site's features. The uploading of videos containing defamation, pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube's \"Community Guidelines\".[311][*better source needed*] Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content, videos of animal abuse, shock videos, content uploaded without the copyright holder's consent, hate speech, spam, and predatory behavior.[311] YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's guidelines.[311] Despite the guidelines, YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations,[312] its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods,[313] hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters,[314] videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections,[315] and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising.[312]\n\n\nYouTube contracts companies to hire content moderators, who view content flagged as potentially violating YouTube's content policies and determines if they should be removed. In September 2020, a class-action suit was filed by a former content moderator who reported developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after an 18-month period on the job. The former content moderator said that she was regularly made to exceed YouTube's stated limit of four hours per day of viewing graphic content. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube's contractors gave little to no training or support for its moderators' mental health, made prospective employees sign NDAs before showing them any examples of content they would see while reviewing, and censored all mention of trauma from its internal forums. It also purports that requests for extremely graphic content to be blurred, reduced in size or made monochrome, per recommendations from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, were rejected by YouTube as not a high priority for the company.[316][317][318]\n\n\nTo limit the spread of misinformation and fake news via YouTube, it has rolled out a comprehensive policy regarding how it plans to deal with technically manipulated videos.[319]\n\n\nControversial content has included material relating to Holocaust denial and the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in 1989.[320][321] In July 2008, the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was \"unimpressed\" with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that \"proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content\". YouTube responded by stating:\n\n\n\n\n> We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly.[322] (July 2008)\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2010, U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner urged YouTube to remove from its website videos of imam Anwar al-Awlaki.[323] YouTube pulled some of the videos in November 2010, stating they violated the site's guidelines.[324] In December 2010, YouTube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content.[325]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube introduced a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other fake news, filling the infobox with content from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech.[326][327] In the wake of the Notre-Dame fire on April 15, 2019, several user-uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by YouTube' system automatically with an Encyclopædia Britannica article on the false conspiracy theories around the September 11 attacks. Several users complained to YouTube about this inappropriate connection. YouTube officials apologized for this, stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically, and were taking steps to remedy this.[328]\n\n\nOn April 18, 2023, YouTube revealed its changes in handling content associated with eating disorders. This social media platform's Community Guidelines now prohibit content that could encourage emulation from at-risk users. This content includes behavior that shows severe calorie tracking and purging after eating. However, videos featuring positive behavior such as in the context of recovery will be permitted on the platform under two conditions—the user must have a registered (logged-in) account and must be older than 18.\nThis policy was created in collaboration with nonprofit organizations as well as the National Eating Disorder Association. Garth Graham, YouTube's Global Head of Healthcare revealed in an interview with CNN that this policy change was geared at ensuring that this video-sharing platform provides an avenue for \"community recovery and resources\" while ensuring continued viewer protection.[329]\n\n\n\n#### Homophobia and transphobia[edit]\n\n\nFive leading content creators whose channels were based on LGBTQ+ materials filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube in August 2019, alleging that YouTube's algorithms divert discovery away from their channels, impacting their revenue. The plaintiffs claimed that the algorithms discourage content with words like \"lesbian\" or \"gay\", which would be predominant in their channels' content, and because of YouTube's near-monopolization of online video services, they are abusing that position.[330]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Media Matters, a media watchdog group, reported that homophobic and transphobic content calling LGBT people \"predators\" and \"groomers\" was becoming more common on YouTube.[331] The report also referred to common accusations in YouTube videos that LGBT people are mentally ill.[331] The report stated the content appeared to be in violation of YouTube's hate speech policy.[331]\n\n\n\n#### Animal torture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(July 2023)*\n |\n\n\nYouTube said animal abuse \"has no place on their platforms, and they are working to remove content\".[332][333][334][335][336][337]\n\n\n\n#### YouTube as a tool to promote conspiracy theories and far-right content[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been criticized for using an algorithm that gives great prominence to videos that promote conspiracy theories, falsehoods and incendiary fringe discourse.[338][339][340] According to an investigation by *The Wall Street Journal*, \"YouTube's recommendations often lead users to channels that feature conspiracy theories, partisan viewpoints and misleading videos, even when those users haven't shown interest in such content. When users show a political bias in what they choose to view, YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases, often with more-extreme viewpoints.\"[338][341] When users search for political or scientific terms, YouTube's search algorithms often give prominence to hoaxes and conspiracy theories.[340][342] After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking-news queries during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources.[338][343][344][345] In 2018, it was reported that YouTube was again promoting fringe content about breaking news, giving great prominence to conspiracy videos about Anthony Bourdain's death.[346]\n\n\nIn 2017, it was revealed that advertisements were being placed on extremist videos, including videos by rape apologists, anti-Semites, and hate preachers who received ad payouts.[347] After firms started to stop advertising on YouTube in the wake of this reporting, YouTube apologized and said that it would give firms greater control over where ads got placed.[347]\n\n\nAlex Jones, known for right-wing conspiracy theories, had built a massive audience on YouTube.[348] YouTube drew criticism in 2018 when it removed a video from Media Matters compiling offensive statements made by Jones, stating that it violated its policies on \"harassment and bullying\".[349] On August 6, 2018, however, YouTube removed Alex Jones' YouTube page following a content violation.[350]\n\n\nUniversity of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has referred to YouTube as \"The Great Radicalizer\", saying \"YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.\"[351] Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University described YouTube as a \"conspiracy ecosystem\".[340][352]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube said that it had introduced a new policy starting in the United States intended to stop recommending videos containing \"content that could misinform users in harmful ways.\" YouTube gave flat earth theories, miracle cures, and 9/11 trutherism as examples.[353] Efforts within YouTube engineering to stop recommending borderline extremist videos falling just short of forbidden hate speech, and track their popularity were originally rejected because they could interfere with viewer engagement.[354] In late 2019, the site began implementing measures directed towards \"raising authoritative content and reducing borderline content and harmful misinformation.\"[355]\n\n\nMultiple research studies have investigated cases of misinformation in YouTube. In a July 2019 study based on ten YouTube searches using the Tor Browser related to climate and climate change, the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change.[356] A May 2023 study found that YouTube was monetizing and profiting from videos that included misinformation about climate change.[357] A 2019 BBC investigation of YouTube searches in ten different languages found that YouTube's algorithm promoted health misinformation, including fake cancer cures.[358] In Brazil, YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters, as well as elevated far-right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories.[359] In the Philippines, numerous channels disseminated misinformation related to the 2022 Philippine elections.[360] Additionally, research on the dissemination of Flat Earth beliefs in social media, has shown that networks of YouTube channels form an echo chamber that polarizes audiences by appearing to confirm preexisting beliefs.[361]\n\n\n\n#### Use among white supremacists[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2019, YouTube took steps to remove specific videos or channels related to supremacist content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site-wide policies against hate speech.[362]\n\n\nIn the wake of the March 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks, YouTube and other sites like Facebook and Twitter that allowed user-submitted content drew criticism for doing little to moderate and control the spread of hate speech, which was considered to be a factor in the rationale for the attacks.[363][364] These platforms were pressured to remove such content, but in an interview with *The New York Times*, YouTube's chief product officer Neal Mohan said that unlike content such as ISIS videos which take a particular format and thus easy to detect through computer-aided algorithms, general hate speech was more difficult to recognize and handle, and thus could not readily take action to remove without human interaction.[365]\n\n\nYouTube joined an initiative led by France and New Zealand with other countries and tech companies in May 2019 to develop tools to be used to block online hate speech and to develop regulations, to be implemented at the national level, to be levied against technology firms that failed to take steps to remove such speech, though the United States declined to participate.[366][367] Subsequently, on June 5, 2019, YouTube announced a major change to its terms of service, \"specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.\" YouTube identified specific examples of such videos as those that \"promote or glorify Nazi ideology, which is inherently discriminatory\". YouTube further stated it would \"remove content denying that well-documented violent events, like the Holocaust or the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, took place.\"[362][368]\n\n\nIn October 2019, YouTube banned the main channel of Red Ice, a white supremacist multimedia company, for hate speech violations. The channel had about 330,000 subscribers. Lana Lokteff and Red Ice promoted a backup channel in an attempt to circumvent the ban.[369][370] A week later, the backup channel was also removed by YouTube.[371][372]\n\n\nIn June 2020, YouTube banned several channels associated with white supremacy, including those of Stefan Molyneux, David Duke, and Richard B. Spencer, asserting these channels violated their policies on hate speech. The ban occurred the same day that Reddit announced the ban on several hate speech sub-forums including r/The Donald.[373]\n\n\n\n#### Handling of COVID-19 pandemic and other misinformation[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the dissemination via YouTube of misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic that 5G communications technology was responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 which led to multiple 5G towers in the United Kingdom being attacked by arsonists, YouTube removed all such videos linking 5G and the coronavirus in this manner.[374]\n\n\nYouTube extended this policy in September 2021 to cover videos disseminating misinformation related to any vaccine, including those long approved against measles or Hepatitis B, that had received approval from local health authorities or the World Health Organization.[375][376] The platform removed the accounts of anti-vaccine campaigners such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Joseph Mercola at this time.[376] Two accounts linked to RT Deutsch, the German channel of the Russian RT network were removed as well for breaching YouTube's policies.[375]\n\n\nYouTube had extended this moderation to non-medical areas. In the weeks following the 2020 United States presidential election, the site added policies to remove or label videos promoting disproving election fraud claims;[377] however, it reversed this policy in June 2023, citing that the removal was necessary to \"openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial or based on disproven assumptions\".[378] Google and YouTube implemented policies in October 2021 to deny monetization or revenue to advertisers or content creators that promoted climate change denial, which \"includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.\"[379]\n\n\nIn July 2022 YouTube announced policies to combat misinformation surrounding abortion, such as videos with instructions to perform abortion methods that are considered unsafe and videos that contain misinformation about the safety of abortion.[380]\n\n\n\n#### Child safety and wellbeing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FamilyOFive, Fantastic Adventures scandal, and Elsagate\n\nLeading into 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children, coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family's activities, and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family-friendly material. In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90%.[381][382] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety. During Q2 2017, the owners of popular channel FamilyOFive, which featured themselves playing \"pranks\" on their children, were accused of child abuse. Their videos were eventually deleted, and two of their children were removed from their custody.[383][384][385][386] A similar case happened in 2019 when the owner of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children. Her videos would later be deleted.[387]\n\n\nLater that year, YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent, sexual or otherwise disturbing situations, many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views. The term \"Elsagate\" was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy.[388][389][390][391] On November 11, 2017, YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content. Later that month, the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family-friendly characters. As part of a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube, the wave of deletions also targeted channels that showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults. Most notably, the company removed *Toy Freaks*, a channel with over 8.5 million subscribers, that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations.[392][393][394][395][396] According to analytics specialist SocialBlade, it earned up to £8.7 million annually prior to its deletion.[397]\n\n\nEven for content that appears to be aimed at children and appears to contain only child-friendly content, YouTube's system allows for anonymity of who uploads these videos. These questions have been raised in the past, as YouTube has had to remove channels with children's content which, after becoming popular, then suddenly include inappropriate content masked as children's content.[398] Alternative, some of the most-watched children's programming on YouTube comes from channels that have no identifiable owners, raising concerns of intent and purpose. One channel that had been of concern was \"Cocomelon\" which provided numerous mass-produced animated videos aimed at children. Up through 2019, it had drawn up to US$10 million a month in ad revenue and was one of the largest kid-friendly channels on YouTube before 2020. Ownership of Cocomelon was unclear outside of its ties to \"Treasure Studio\", itself an unknown entity, raising questions as to the channel's purpose,[398][399][400] but *Bloomberg News* had been able to confirm and interview the small team of American owners in February 2020 regarding \"Cocomelon\", who stated their goal for the channel was to simply entertain children, wanting to keep to themselves to avoid attention from outside investors.[401] The anonymity of such channel raise concerns because of the lack of knowledge of what purpose they are trying to serve.[402] The difficulty to identify who operates these channels \"adds to the lack of accountability\", according to Josh Golin of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, and educational consultant Renée Chernow-O'Leary found the videos were designed to entertain with no intent to educate, all leading to critics and parents to be concerned for their children becoming too enraptured by the content from these channels.[398] Content creators that earnestly make child-friendly videos have found it difficult to compete with larger channels, unable to produce content at the same rate as them, and lacking the same means of being promoted through YouTube's recommendation algorithms that the larger animated channel networks have shared.[402]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube officially banned videos containing \"challenges that encourage acts that have an inherent risk of severe physical harm\" (such as the Tide Pod Challenge) and videos featuring pranks that \"make victims believe they're in physical danger\" or cause emotional distress in children.[403]\n\n\n\n##### Sexualization of children and pedophilia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Elsagate\n\nAlso in November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children—often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics—were attracting comments from pedophiles[404][405] with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian.[405] Other child-centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web, and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles.[406]\n\n\nAs a result of the controversy, which added to the concern about \"Elsagate\", several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube.[391][407] In December 2018, *The Times* found more than 100 grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior (such as taking off clothes, adopting overtly sexual poses and touching other children inappropriately) by strangers.[408] After a reporter flagged the videos in question, half of them were removed, and the rest were removed after *The Times* contacted YouTube's PR department.[408]\n\n\nIn February 2019, YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a \"wormhole\" that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content, and make all of that user's recommended content feature only these types of videos.[409] Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions or otherwise making indecent remarks. In some cases, other users had re-uploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos, and then monetized these, propagating this network.[410] In the wake of the controversy, the service reported that they had deleted over 400 channels and tens of millions of comments, and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A spokesperson explained that \"any content—including comments—that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.\"[411][412] Despite these measures, AT&T, Disney, Dr. Oetker, Epic Games, and Nestlé all pulled their advertising from YouTube.[410][413]\n\n\nSubsequently, YouTube began to demonetize and block advertising on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments. The service explained that this was a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem.[414] YouTube also began to flag channels that predominantly feature children, and preemptively disable their comments sections. \"Trusted partners\" can request that comments be re-enabled, but the channel will then become responsible for moderating comments. These actions mainly target videos of toddlers, but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual, such as gymnastics. YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators.[415][416]\n\n\nA related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string \"CP\" (an abbreviation of child pornography) resulted in some prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation, including videos related to the mobile video game *Pokémon Go* (which uses \"CP\" as an abbreviation of the statistic \"Combat Power\"), and *Club Penguin*. YouTube apologized for the errors and reinstated the affected videos.[417] Separately, online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said; this activity became an issue during the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in early 2019. YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity.[418]\n\n\nIn June 2019, *The New York Times* cited researchers who found that users who watched erotic videos could be recommended seemingly innocuous videos of children.[419] As a result, Senator Josh Hawley stated plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban YouTube and other video sharing sites from including videos that predominantly feature minors as \"recommended\" videos, excluding those that were \"professionally produced\", such as videos of televised talent shows.[420] YouTube has suggested potential plans to remove all videos featuring children from the main YouTube site and transferring them to the YouTube Kids site where they would have stronger controls over the recommendation system, as well as other major changes on the main YouTube site to the recommended feature and autoplay system.[421]\n\n\n\n#### Misogyny[edit]\n\n\nA January 2022 report by the social media analytics firm Bot Sentinel said that several online influencers were using YouTube to exclusively post negative content about Prince Harry and Meghan, including conspiracy theories about the couple, in what it called \"a lucrative hate-for-profit enterprise\" where \"racism and YouTube ad revenue are the primary motivators.\" Bot Sentinel also found that one of the most prominent accounts promoting a conspiracy theory that Meghan was never pregnant had accumulated nearly 19 million views and was earning around $44,000 a year. YouTube banned the account in March.[422]\n\n\nAn August 2022 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a British think tank, found that harassment against women was flourishing on YouTube. It noted that channels espousing a similar ideology to that of men's rights influencer Andrew Tate were using YouTube to grow their audience, despite Tate being banned from the platform.[423] In his 2022 book *Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise to World Domination*, Bloomberg reporter Mark Bergen said that many female content creators were dealing with harassment, bullying and stalking.[423]\n\n\n\n### April Fools gags[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Google April Fools' Day jokes\n\nYouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016. In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a prank known as \"rickrolling\".[424][425] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a \"new layout\".[426] In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a \"TEXTp\" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters \"in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.\"[427]\n\n\nThe next year, the site celebrated its \"100th anniversary\" with a range of sepia-toned silent, early 1900s-style films, including a parody of Keyboard Cat.[428] In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on DVD.[429]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company *The Onion* to claim in an uploaded video that the video-sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.[430][431]\n\n\nIn 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as \"Clocking\", \"Kissing Dad\", and \"Glub Glub Water Dance\".[432] The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from \"Sandstorm\" by Darude.[433] In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.[434]\n\n\n\n## Services[edit]\n\n\n### YouTube Premium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Premium\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Premium\nYouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers advertising-free streaming, access to original programming, and background and offline video playback on mobile devices.[435] YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as \"Music Key\", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music \"All Access\" service.[436][437][438] On October 28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos and access to exclusive original content.[439][440][441] As of November 2016[update], the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis.[442] As of June 2017[update], the first season of YouTube Originals had gotten 250 million views in total.[443]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Kids[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Kids\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Kids\nYouTube Kids is an American children's video app developed by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google. The app was developed in response to parental and government scrutiny on the content available to children. The app provides a version of the service-oriented towards children, with curated selections of content, parental control features, and filtering of videos deemed inappropriate viewing for children aged under 13, 8 or 5 depending on the age grouping chosen. First released on February 15, 2015, as an Android and iOS mobile app, the app has since been released for LG, Samsung, and Sony smart TVs, as well as for Android TV. On May 27, 2020, it became available on Apple TV. As of September 2019, the app is available in 69 countries, including Hong Kong and Macau, and one province. YouTube launched a web-based version of YouTube Kids on August 30, 2019.\n\n\n\n### YouTube Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Music\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Music\nOn September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the co-founder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music Group executive, the Global Head of Music.[444]\n\n\nIn early 2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a platform that would compete with other services such as Spotify and Apple Music.[445] On May 22, 2018, the music streaming platform named \"YouTube Music\" was launched.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Movies[edit]\n\n\nYouTube Movies is a service by YouTube that shows movies via its website. Around 100–500 movies are free to view, with ads. Some new movies get added and some get removed, unannounced at a new month.[448]\n\n\n\n### YouTube TV[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube TV\n\n![](image)YouTube TV logo\nOn February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$65 per month. Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017,[449][450] the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC), as well as approximately 40 cable channels owned by the corporate parents of those networks, The Walt Disney Company, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal and Turner Broadcasting System (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN). Subscribers can also receive Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Premium original content.[451][452]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Go[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Go\nIn September 2016, *YouTube Go* was announced,[453] as an Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets. It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users. It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution.[454]\n\n\nIn February 2017, *YouTube Go* was launched in India, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South Africa.[455][456] On February 1, 2018, it was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq. Before it shut down, the app was available to around 60% of the world's population.[457][458] In May 2022, Google announced that they would be shutting down *YouTube Go* in August 2022.[459]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Shorts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Shorts\n\nAn example video that is suitable for YouTube Shorts, showing Crew Dragon *Endeavour* docking at the International Space Station\nIn September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts.[460][461] The platform was first tested in India but as of March 2021 has expanded to other countries including the United States with videos now able to be up to 1 minute long.[462] The platform is not a standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app. Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools, including the possibility of adding licensed music to their videos.[463] The platform had its global beta launch in July 2021.[464]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Stories[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube started testing a new feature initially called \"YouTube Reels\".[465] The feature is nearly identical to Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories. YouTube later renamed the feature \"YouTube Stories\". It is only available to creators who have more than 10,000 subscribers and can only be posted/seen in the YouTube mobile app.[466] On May 25, 2023, YouTube announced that it would be shutting down this feature on June 26, 2023.[467][468]\n\n\n\n## Social impact[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social impact of YouTube\n\nPrivate individuals[469] and large production corporations[470] have used YouTube to grow their audiences. Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic.[469] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television.[470] While YouTube's revenue-sharing \"Partner Program\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually[471] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million[472]—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \"a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels.\"[473] In 2013 *Forbes*' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.[474] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \"mega\", \"mainstream\" and \"mid-sized\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year.[475] By early 2013, *Billboard* had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the *Billboard* Hot 100 and related genre charts.[476]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan Hoffner at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards accepting for YouTube\nObserving that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been \"fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution\", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that \"what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication.\"[477] Anderson asserted that it is not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch \"the biggest learning cycle in human history.\"[477] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what *Forbes'* Michael Noer called \"the largest school in the world,\" with technology poised to disrupt how people learn.[478] YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award,[479] the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that \"both embodies and promotes democracy.\"[480] *The Washington Post* reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white.[481] A Pew Research Center study reported the development of \"visual journalism\", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation.[482] The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.[483]\n\n\nYouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape.[484] Describing the Arab Spring (2010–2012), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using \"Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.\"[485] In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the \"Kony 2012\" video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video \"will do more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined.\"[486]\n\n\n\n![](image)Leading YouTube content creators met at the White House with U.S. President Obama to discuss how government could better connect with the \"YouTube generation.\"[487][488]\nConversely, YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012[489] and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance.[490] In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare[491] but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the \"YouTube Generation.\"[487] Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.[487]\n\n\nSome YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as *Innocence of Muslims* (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.[492] TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.[477] Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in *The New York Times* that such videos have \"surprising implications\" for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.[493]\n\n\nA 2017 article in *The New York Times Magazine* posited that YouTube had become \"the new talk radio\" for the far right.[494] Almost a year before YouTube's January 2019 announcement that it would begin a \"gradual change\" of \"reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways\",[495] Zeynep Tufekci had written in *The New York Times* that, \"(g)iven its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century\".[496] Under YouTube's changes to its recommendation engine, the most recommended channel evolved from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (2016) to Fox News (2019).[497] According to a 2020 study, \"An emerging journalistic consensus theorizes the central role played by the video 'recommendation engine,' but we believe that this is premature. Instead, we propose the 'Supply and Demand' framework for analyzing politics on YouTube.\"[498] A 2022 study found that \"despite widespread concerns that YouTube's algorithms send people down 'rabbit holes' with recommendations to extremist videos, little systematic evidence exists to support this conjecture\", \"exposure to alternative and extremist channel videos on YouTube is heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment.\", and \"contrary to the 'rabbit holes' narrative, non-subscribers are rarely recommended videos from alternative and extremist channels and seldom follow such recommendations when offered.\"[499]\n\n\n*The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers*[500] and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra[501] selected their membership based on individual video performances.[477][501] Further, the cybercollaboration charity video \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)\" was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work,[502] with *The Tokyo Times* noting the \"We Pray for You\" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.[503]\nThe anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens,[504] that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet secretaries.[505] Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video \"My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm,\" legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy.[506] In May 2018, after London Metropolitan Police claimed that drill music videos glamorizing violence gave rise to gang violence, YouTube deleted 30 videos.[507]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nPrior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as \"not material\" in a regulatory filing.[508] In June 2008, a *Forbes* magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.[509] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion.[510] In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to eMarketer,[510][511] while others estimated $4.7 billion.[510] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising.[62] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month.[512] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.[62]\n\n\nGoogle first published exact revenue numbers for YouTube in February 2020 as part of Alphabet's 2019 financial report. According to Google, YouTube had made US$15.1 billion in ad revenue in 2019, in contrast to US$8.1 billion in 2017 and US$11.1 billion in 2018. YouTube's revenues made up nearly 10% of the total Alphabet revenue in 2019.[513][514] These revenues accounted for approximately 20 million subscribers combined between YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions, and 2 million subscribers to YouTube TV.[515]\n\n\nYouTube had $19.8 billion in revenue in 2020.[516]\n\n\n\n### Partnership with corporations[edit]\n\n\nYouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[517] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment.[518] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called \"Shows\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[519][520] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[521] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service,[522] which is only available to users in the United States, Canada, and the UK as of 2010.[523][524][*needs update*] The service offers over 6,000 films.[525]\n\n\n\n#### 2017 advertiser boycott[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would \"be delivered safely and appropriately\". *The Guardian* newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had \"begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear\".[526][527] In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a *Wall Street Journal* article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.[528][529]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2017, YouTube announced that to \"ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules\", it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000-lifetime views, before they may join the Partner Program.[530]\n\n\n\n### YouTuber earnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Total annual earnings of the top ten YouTuber accounts, and the income of the single highest-earning account.\nIn May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site.[531] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.[532][533]\n\n\nThere are over two million members of the YouTube Partner Program.[534] According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually, no more than half of the eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.[535]\n\n\nYouTube's policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising, including videos containing violence, strong language, sexual content, \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\" (unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\"),[536] and videos whose user comments contain \"inappropriate\" content.[537]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos.[538][539] In April 2017, YouTube set an eligibility requirement of 10,000 lifetime views for a paid subscription.[540] On January 16, 2018, the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to 4,000 hours of watch-time within the past 12 months and 1,000 subscribers.[540] The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to controversy, but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels.[541]\n\n\nYouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.[542] The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal, ruby, and red tinted crystal glass are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million, fifty million subscribers, and one hundred million subscribers, respectively.[543][544]\n\n\nYouTube's policies on \"advertiser-friendly content\" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized; this includes strong violence, language,[545] sexual content, and \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\", unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\".[546] In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent users, including Phillip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was \"censorship by a different name\". A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new, the service had \"improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators\".[547][548][549] *Boing Boing* reported in 2019 that LGBT keywords resulted in demonetization.[550]\n\n\nAs of November 2020 in the United States and June 2021 worldwide,[551] YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform, even if their uploader is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program. This will occur on channels whose content is deemed \"advertiser-friendly\", and all revenue will go directly to Google without any share given to the uploader.[552]\n\n\n\n### Revenue to copyright holders[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: § Copyrighted material\n\nThe majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue.[553] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders. YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue.[554] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games.[555] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program.[556][557][558] On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program. Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019.[559][560]\n\n\n\n## Censorship and bans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Censorship of YouTube\n\n![](image)Availability of YouTube as of January 2021:  \n Has local YouTube version\n Accessible (Worldwide version)\n Currently blocked\n Previously blocked\n\nYouTube has been censored, filtered, or banned for a variety of reasons, including:[561]\n\n\n\n* Limiting public access and exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest.\n* Preventing criticism of a ruler (e.g. in North Korea), government (e.g. in China) or its actions (e.g. in Morocco), government officials (e.g. in Turkey and Libya), or religion (e.g. in Pakistan).\n* Morality-based laws, e.g. in Iran.\n\n\nAccess to specific videos is sometimes prevented due to copyright and intellectual property protection laws (e.g. in Germany), violations of hate speech, and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate for youth,[562] which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with \"restricted mode\".[563] Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to its bandwidth limitations[564][565] and the site's potential for distraction.[561][566]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], public access to YouTube is blocked in many countries, including China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan,[567] Uzbekistan,[568][569] Tajikistan, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. In some countries, YouTube is blocked for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.[561]\n\n\nReports emerged that since October 2019, comments posted with Chinese characters insulting the Chinese Communist Party (共匪 or \"communist bandit\") or (五毛 or \"50 Cent Party\", referring to state-sponsored commentators) were being automatically deleted within 15 seconds.[570]\n\n\nSpecific incidents where YouTube has been blocked include:\n\n\n\n* Thailand blocked access in April 2007 over a video said to be insulting the Thai king.[571]\n* Morocco blocked access in May 2007, possibly as a result of videos critical of Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara.[572] YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007, after *Maroc Telecom* unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere \"technical glitch\".[573]\n* Turkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.[574][575][576] In November 2010, a video of the Turkish politician Deniz Baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly, and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video.[577] During the two and a half-year block of YouTube, the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed site in Turkey.[578][579] In 2014, Turkey blocked the access for the second time, after \"a high-level intelligence leak.\"[580][581][582]\n* Pakistan blocked access on February 23, 2008, because of \"offensive material\" towards the Islamic faith, including display of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.[583] This led to a near global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours, as the Pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries. On February 26, 2008, the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government.[584][585] Many Pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private network software.[586] In May 2010, following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube, citing \"growing sacrilegious content\".[587] The ban was lifted on May 27, 2010, after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government. However, individual videos deemed offensive to Muslims posted on YouTube will continue to be blocked.[588][589] Pakistan again placed a ban on YouTube in September 2012, after the site refused to remove the film *Innocence of Muslims*. The ban was lifted in January 2016 after YouTube launched a Pakistan-specific version.[590]\n* Libya blocked access on January 24, 2010, because of videos that featured demonstrations in the city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch.[591] In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.[592]\n* Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sudan blocked access in September 2012 following controversy over a 14-minute trailer for the film *Innocence of Muslims* which had been posted on the site.[593][594][595][596][597] A court in the southern Russian Republic of Chechnya ruled that *Innocence of Muslims* should be banned.[598] In Libya and Egypt, it was blamed for violent protests. YouTube stated: \"This video—which is widely available on the Web—is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries.\"[599][600]\n* Russia threatened to ban YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021.[601] Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube announced on March 1 the immediate removal of RT (and other Russian-government funded outlets) from its platform in Europe.[602]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Invidious, a free and open-source alternative frontend to YouTube\n* Alternative media\n* BookTube\n* BreadTube\n* CNN/YouTube presidential debates\n* Lists\n\t+ Comparison of video hosting services\n\t+ List of Google Easter eggs#YouTube\n\t+ List of Internet phenomena\n\t+ List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-liked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n\t+ List of online video platforms\n\t+ List of YouTubers\n* Lawsuits\n\t+ *Viacom International Inc. v.

Accessible worldwide,[7] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website in the world, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users,[8] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos every day.[9] As of May 2019[update], videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[10][11]\n\n\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[12] Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a greater audience.\n\n\nYouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite its growth and success, it has been widely criticized for allegedly facilitating the spread of misinformation and the sharing of copyrighted content, routinely violating its users' privacy, enabling censorship, endangering child safety and wellbeing, and for its inconsistent or incorrect implementation of platform guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of YouTube\n\n### Founding and initial growth (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, the founders of YouTube.\nYouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay.[14] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[15]\n\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[16]\n\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[17] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[16][18] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[19] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)The YouTube logo used from its launch until 2007;[*citation needed*] it returned in 2008 before being removed again in 2010.[*citation needed*] Another version of this logo without the \"Broadcast Yourself\" slogan was used until 2011.\nYouTube began as a venture capital–funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two.[14][21] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[22] In February 2005, the company activated `www.youtube.com`.[23] The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\nYouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was launched in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor.[31] The week of YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's *Saturday Night Live* ran a skit \"Lazy Sunday\" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for *Saturday Night Live*, \"Lazy Sunday\"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website.[32] Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns.[33] Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content.[34][35] The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[36]\n\n\nThe choice of the name `www.youtube.com` led to problems for a similarly named website, `www.utube.com`. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to `www.utubeonline.com`.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast Yourself era (2006–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California\nOn October 9, 2006, Google announced that it had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock.[39][40] The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[41][42] Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube.[31] It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself\".\nThe company experienced rapid growth. *The Daily Telegraph* wrote that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000.[43] By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos, according to comScore.[44] That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site.[45] In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every minute.[46][47][48] However, most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[49] That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red.[50][51] A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013.[52] By that point, more than 100 hours were being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014.[53][54]\n\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo from 2015 until 2017\nDuring this time, the company also went through some organizational changes. In October 2006, YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno, California.[55] Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as a chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company in October 2010.[56]\n\n\nIn December 2009, YouTube partnered with Vevo.[57] In April 2010, Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" became the most viewed video, becoming the first video to reach 200 million views on May 9, 2010.[58]\n\n\n\n### Susan Wojcicki and going mainstream (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo since 2017\nSusan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014.[59] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million. The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees.[60] YouTube officially launched the \"polymer\" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017.[61]\n\n\nThrough this period, YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond advertisements. In 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium, subscription-based channels.[62][63] This effort was discontinued in January 2018 and relaunched in June, with US$4.99 channel subscriptions.[64][65] These channel subscriptions complemented the existing Super Chat ability, launched in 2017, which allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment highlighted.[66] In 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as \"Music Key,\" which bundled ad-free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[67] The service continued to evolve in 2015 when YouTube announced YouTube Red, a new premium service that would offer ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year), premium original series, and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform.[68][69][70]\n\n\nThe company also attempted to create products appealing to specific viewers. YouTube released a mobile app known as YouTube Kids in 2015, designed to provide an experience optimized for children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control features.[71] Also in 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[72]\n\n\nThe company was attacked on April 3, 2018, when a shooting occurred at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California, which wounded four and resulted in the death of the shooter.[73]\n\n\n\n### Recent history (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\nBy February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute.[9][74] Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than 500 hours per minute.[10] During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-at-home orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased. One data firm[*which?*] estimated that YouTube was accounting for 15% of all internet traffic, twice its pre-pandemic level.[75] In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix stated they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's request.[76] YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.\"[77]\n\n\nFollowing a 2018 complaint alleging violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),[78] the company was fined $170 million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of 13.[79] YouTube was also ordered to create systems to increase children's privacy.[80][81] Following criticisms of its implementation of those systems, YouTube started treating all videos designated as \"made for kids\" as liable under COPPA on January 6, 2020.[82][83] Joining the YouTube Kids app, the company created a supervised mode, designed more for tweens, in 2021.[84] Additionally, to compete with TikTok, YouTube released YouTube Shorts, a short-form video platform.\n\n\nDuring this period, YouTube entered disputes with other tech companies. For over a year, in 2018 and 2019, no YouTube app was available for Amazon Fire products.[85] In 2020, Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement.[86]\n\n\nAfter testing earlier in 2021, YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November 2021, claiming the reason for the removal was, based on its internal research, that users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading.[87] While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls, others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as \"a stupid idea\", and that the real reason behind the change was \"not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed.\" He felt that users' ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential, saying, \"The process works, and there's a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines.\"[88][89][90] Shortly after the announcement, software developer Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike, an open-source, third-party browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video's number of dislikes.[91] In a letter published on January 25, 2022, by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, acknowledged that removing public dislike counts was a controversial decision, but reiterated that she stands by this decision, claiming that \"it reduced dislike attacks.\"[92]\n\n\nIn 2022, YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts, intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video. Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads, YouTube \"ended\" the experiment on September 19 of that year.[93] In October, YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles (e.g. @MrBeast6000) in addition to channel names, which would also become channel URLs.[94]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor. Wojcicki will take on an advisory role for Google and parent company Alphabet.[95]\n\n\nIn late October 2023, YouTube began cracking down on the use of ad blockers on the platform. Users of ad blockers may be given a pop-up warning saying \"Video player will be blocked after 3 videos\". Users of ad blockers are shown a message inviting them to subscribe to YouTube Premium. YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service.[96][97]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and held the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023.[95] The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023.[95]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Video technology[edit]\n\n\nYouTube primarily uses the VP9 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video codecs, and the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP protocol.[98] MPEG-4 Part 2 streams contained within 3GP containers are also provided for low bandwidth connections.[99] By January 2019, YouTube had begun rolling out videos in AV1 format.[100] In 2021 it was reported that the company was considering requiring AV1 in streaming hardware in order to decrease bandwidth and increase quality.[101] Video is usually streamed alongside the Opus and AAC audio codecs.[99]\n\n\nAt launch in 2005, viewing YouTube videos on a personal computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to be installed in the browser.[102] In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of Web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard.[103] This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed.[104] On January 27, 2015, YouTube announced that HTML5 would be the default playback method on supported browsers.[103] HTML5 video streams use Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), an HTTP-based adaptive bit-rate streaming solution optimizes the bitrate and quality for the available network.[105]\n\n\nThe platform can serve videos at optionally lower resolution levels starting at 144p for smoothening playback in areas and countries with limited Internet speeds, improving compatibility, as well as for the preservation of limited cellular data plans. The resolution can be adjusted automatically based on detected connection speed or set manually.[106][107]\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2017, users could add \"annotations\" to their videos, such as pop-up text messages and hyperlinks, which allowed for interactive videos. By 2019 all annotations had been removed from videos, breaking some videos that depended on the feature. YouTube introduced standardized widgets intended to replace annotations in a cross-platform manner, including \"end screens\" (a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video).[108][109][110]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube became an International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) registry, and announced its intention to begin creating ISNI identifiers to uniquely identify the musicians whose videos it features.[111]\n\n\nUsers can verify their account, normally through a mobile phone, to gain the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as produce live streams.[112][113] Users who have built sufficient channel history and have a good track record of complying with the site's Community Guidelines will also gain access to these aforementioned features as well.[114] When YouTube was launched in 2005, it was possible to upload longer videos, but a 10-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films.[115] The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010.[116] Videos can be at most 256 GB in size or 12 hours, whichever is less.[112] As of 2021[update], automatic closed captions using speech recognition technology when a video is uploaded are available in 13 languages, and can be machine-translated during playback.[117]\n\n\nYouTube also offers manual closed captioning as part of its creator studio.[118] YouTube formerly offered a 'Community Captions' feature, where viewers could write and submit captions for public display upon approval by the video uploader, but this was deprecated in September 2020.[119]\n\n\nYouTube accepts the most common container formats, including MP4, Matroska, FLV, AVI, WebM, 3GP, MPEG-PS, and the QuickTime File Format. Some intermediate video formats (i.e., primarily used for professional video editing, not for final delivery or storage) are also accepted, such as ProRes.[120] YouTube provides recommended encoding settings.[121]\n\n\nEach video is identified by an eleven-character case-sensitive alphanumerical Base64 string in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which can contain letters, digits, an underscore (`_`), and a dash (`-`).[122]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube added a feature called *Premiere* which displays a notification to the user mentioning when the video will be available for the first time, like for a live stream but with a prerecorded video. When the scheduled time arrives, the video is aired as a live broadcast with a two-minute countdown. Optionally, a premiere can be initiated immediately.[123]\n\n\n\n#### Quality and formats[edit]\n\n\nYouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320×240 pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec (a variant of H.263),[124][125] with mono MP3 audio.[126] In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3GP format on mobile phones.[127] In March 2008, a high-quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480×360 pixels.[128] In December 2008, 720p HD support was added. At the time of the 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9.[129] With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format. In November 2009, 1080p HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels.[130][131] In July 2010, support for 4K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 3840 × 2160 pixels.[132] In June 2015, support for 8K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels.[133] In November 2016, support for HDR video was added which can be encoded with hybrid log–gamma (HLG) or perceptual quantizer (PQ).[134] HDR video can be encoded with the Rec. 2020 color space.[135]\n\n\nIn June 2014, YouTube began to deploy support for high frame rate videos up to 60 frames per second (as opposed to 30 before), becoming available for user uploads in October. YouTube stated that this would enhance \"motion-intensive\" videos, such as video game footage.[136][137][138][139]\n\n\nYouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. Viewers only indirectly influence the video quality. In the mobile apps, users choose between \"Auto\", which adjusts resolution based on the internet connection, \"High Picture Quality\" which will prioritize playing high-quality video, \"Data saver\" which will sacrifice video quality in favor of low data usage and \"Advanced\" which lets the user choose a stream resolution.[140] On desktop, users choose between \"Auto\" and a specific resolution.[141] It is not possible for the viewer to directly choose a higher bitrate (quality) for any selected resolution.\n\n\nSince 2009, viewers have had the ability to watch 3D videos.[142] In 2015, YouTube began natively supporting 360-degree video. Since April 2016, it allowed live streaming 360° video, and both normal and 360° video at up to 1440p, and since November 2016 both at up to 4K (2160p) resolution.[143][144][145] Citing the limited number of users who watched more than 90-degrees, it began supporting an alternative stereoscopic video format known as VR180 which it said was easier to produce,[146] which allows users to watch any video using virtual reality headsets.[147]\n\n\nIn response to increased viewership during the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube temporarily downgraded the quality of its videos.[148][149] YouTube developed its own chip, called Argos, to help with encoding higher resolution videos in 2021.[150]\n\n\nIn certain cases, YouTube allows the uploader to upgrade the quality of videos uploaded a long time ago in poor quality. One such partnership with Universal Music Group included remasters of 1,000 music videos.[151]\n\n\n\n#### Live streaming[edit]\n\n\nYouTube carried out early experiments with live streaming, including its YouTube Live event in 2008,[152] a concert by U2 in 2009, and a question-and-answer session with US President Barack Obama in February 2010.[153] These tests had relied on technology from 3rd-party partners, but in September 2010, YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure.[154] In April 2011, YouTube announced the rollout of *YouTube Live*. The creation of live streams was initially limited to select partners.[155] It was used for real-time broadcasting of events such as the 2012 Olympics in London.[156] In October 2012, more than 8 million people watched Felix Baumgartner's jump from the edge of space as a live stream on YouTube.[157]\n\n\nIn May 2013, creation of live streams was opened to verified users with at least 1,000 subscribers; in August of the same year the number was reduced to 100 subscribers,[158] and in December the limit was removed.[159] In February 2017, live streaming was introduced to the official YouTube mobile app. Live streaming via mobile was initially restricted to users with at least 10,000 subscribers,[160] but as of mid-2017 it has been reduced to 100 subscribers.[161] Live streams support HDR, can be up to 4K resolution at 60 fps, and also support 360° video.[144][162]\n\n\n\n### User features[edit]\n\n\n#### Comment system [edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google § YouTube user comments\n\nMost videos enable users to leave comments, which have attracted attention for the negative aspects of their form and content.[*specify*] In 2006, *Time* praised Web 2.0 for enabling \"community and collaboration on a scale never seen before\", and added that YouTube \"harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred\".[163] *The Guardian* in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as:[164]\n\n\n\n\n> Juvenile, aggressive, misspelt, sexist, homophobic, swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL, YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance—with the occasional burst of wit shining through.\n> \n> \n\n\n*The Daily Telegraph* commented in September 2008, that YouTube was \"notorious\" for \"some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet\", and reported on YouTube Comment Snob, \"a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts\".[165] *The Huffington Post* noted in April 2012 that finding comments on YouTube that appear \"offensive, stupid and crass\" to the \"vast majority\" of the people is hardly difficult.[166]\n\n\nGoogle subsequently implemented a comment system oriented on Google+ on November 6, 2013, that required all YouTube users to use a Google+ account to comment on videos. The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone.[167] The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse.[168][169] In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change.[170] The official YouTube announcement[171] received 20,097 \"thumbs down\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.[172] Writing in the *Newsday* blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network like Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\" and added that \"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with the outcry against the new comment system\". In the same article Melvin goes on to say:[173]\n\n\n\n\n> Perhaps user complaints are justified, but the idea of revamping the old system isn't so bad.\n> Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation. Isn't any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot? The system is far from perfect, but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity.\n> \n> \n\n\nLater, on July 27, 2015, Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google+ account to post comments to YouTube.[174] On November 3, 2016, YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve, hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments.[175] Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam. They can also allow other users to moderate their comments.[176]\n\n\nIn December 2020, it was reported that YouTube would launch a new feature that will warn users who post a comment that \"may be offensive to others.\"[177][178]\n\n\n\n#### Community[edit]\n\n\nOn September 13, 2016, YouTube launched a public beta of Community, a social media-based feature that allows users to post text, images (including GIFs), live videos and others in a separate \"Community\" tab on their channel.[179] Prior to the release, several creators had been consulted to suggest tools Community could incorporate that they would find useful; these YouTubers included Vlogbrothers, AsapScience, Lilly Singh, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons, Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger and Vsauce3.[180][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nAfter the feature has been officially released, the *community post* feature gets activated automatically for every channel that passes a specific threshold of subscriber counts or already has more subscribers. This threshold was lowered over time,[*when?*] from 10,000 subscribers to 1500 subscribers, to 1000 subscribers,[181][*non-primary source needed*] to 500 subscribers.[182]\n\n\nChannels that the community tab becomes enabled for, get their channel discussions (previously known as channel comments) permanently erased, instead of co-existing or migrating.[183][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n#### TestTube[edit]\n\n\nExperimental features of YouTube can be accessed in an area of the site named *TestTube*.[184][185]\n\n\nFor example, in October 2009, a *comment search* feature accessible under `/comment_search` was implemented as part of this program. The feature was removed later.[186]\n\n\nLater the same year, *YouTube Feather* was introduced as a \"lightweight\" alternative website for countries with limited internet speeds.[187]\n\n\n\n### Content accessibility[edit]\n\n\nYouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web.[188] This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by, or related to another user's video can make a \"video response\". The eleven character YouTube video identifier (64 possible characters used in each position), allows for a theoretical maximum of 6411 or around 73.8 quintillion (73.8 billion billion) unique ids.\n\n\nYouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature on August 27, 2013.[189] Embedding, rating, commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner.[190] YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos, and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface.[191] A small number of videos can be downloaded as MP4 files.[192] Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos.[193]\n\n\nIn February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout.[194] In June 2012, Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos.[195] In response, Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site.[196] Users retain copyright of their own work under the default Standard YouTube License,[197] but have the option to grant certain usage rights under any public copyright license they choose.\n\n\nSince July 2012, it has been possible to select a Creative Commons attribution license as the default, allowing other users to reuse and remix the material.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Platforms[edit]\n\n\nMost modern smartphones are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video.[199] Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.[200]\n\n\nSince June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone.[201]\n\n\nThe mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 in July 2010, avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls.[202] The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform.[203][204]\n\n\nIn September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system.[205] According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third-most used app.[206]\n\n\nA TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos.[207]\n\n\nIn January 2009, YouTube launched \"YouTube for TV\", a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers, initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles.[208][209]\n\n\nDuring the month of June that same year, YouTube XL was introduced, which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen.[210] YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live.[211]\n\n\nOn November 15, 2012, Google launched an official app for the Wii, allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel.[212] An app was available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, but was discontinued in August 2019.[213] Videos can also be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5.[214][*non-primary source needed*] Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17, 2013,[215] and, in October 2014, the Sony PlayStation 4.[216]\n\n\nYouTube launched as a downloadable app for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018.[217]\n\n\n\n### International and localization[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt appeared in Paris to launch the new localization system.[218] The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 104 countries, one territory (Hong Kong) and a worldwide version.[219]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

chosen based on the IP address of the user. In some cases, the message \"This video is not available in your country\" may appear because of copyright restrictions or inappropriate content.[268] The interface of the YouTube website is available in 76 language versions, including Amharic, Albanian, Armenian, Burmese, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Persian and Uzbek, which do not have local channel versions. Access to YouTube was blocked in Turkey between 2008 and 2010, following controversy over the posting of videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and some material offensive to Muslims.[269][270] In October 2012, a local version of YouTube was launched in Turkey, with the domain `youtube.com.tr`. The local version is subject to the content regulations found in Turkish law.[271] In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British royalty collection agency PRS for Music led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach an agreement on a licensing deal. The dispute was resolved in September 2009.[272] In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany.[273]\n\n\n\n## Videos[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television.[274] In 2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by *The Daily Dot* that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. This was disputed by *Billboard*, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.[276][277] On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behaviour which caused a video's view count to freeze at \"301\" (later \"301+\") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.[278] YouTube view counts once again updated in real time.[279]\n\n\nSince September 2019, subscriber counts are abbreviated. Only three leading digits of channels' subscriber counts are indicated publicly, compromising the function of third-party real-time indicators such as that of Social Blade. Exact counts remain available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio.[280]\n\n\nOn November 11, 2021, after testing out this change in March of the same year, YouTube announced it would start hiding dislike counts on videos, making them invisible to viewers. The company stated the decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment. Creators will still be able to see the number of likes and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool, according to YouTube.[281][282][283]\n\n\n\n### Copyright issues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube copyright issues\n\nFurther information: § Revenue to copyright holders\n\nYouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns.[32] At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws.[284] Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted.[285][286] From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.[287][288][289]\n\n\nIn August 2008, a US court ruled in *Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.* that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material.[290] YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply.[291]\n\n\nIn the 2011 case of *Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC*, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube.[292] He asserted seven causes of action, and four were ruled in Smith's favor.[293] In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users.[294] On November 1, 2016, the dispute with GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA.[295]\n\n\nIn April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice.[296][297] As part of YouTube Music, Universal and YouTube signed an agreement in 2017, which was followed by separate agreements other major labels, which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube.[298] By 2019, creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video, with different levels of enforcement depending on the record label.[299] Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use.[299]\n\n\n\n#### Content ID[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Content ID (system)\n\nIn June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute.[300] The system, which was initially called \"Video Identification\"[301][302] and later became known as Content ID,[303] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[304] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.\n\n\nAn independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was \"surprisingly resilient\" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.[305] The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.[306] If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.[307]\n\n\nBefore 2016, videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved. Since April 2016, videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute.[308] Should the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the \"Video Manager\".[309] YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.[310]\n\n\n\n### Moderation and offensive content[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google § YouTube, and Censorship by Google § YouTube\n\nYouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site's features. The uploading of videos containing defamation, pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube's \"Community Guidelines\".[311][*better source needed*] Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content, videos of animal abuse, shock videos, content uploaded without the copyright holder's consent, hate speech, spam, and predatory behavior.[311] YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's guidelines.[311] Despite the guidelines, YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations,[312] its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods,[313] hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters,[314] videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections,[315] and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising.[312]\n\n\nYouTube contracts companies to hire content moderators, who view content flagged as potentially violating YouTube's content policies and determines if they should be removed. In September 2020, a class-action suit was filed by a former content moderator who reported developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after an 18-month period on the job. The former content moderator said that she was regularly made to exceed YouTube's stated limit of four hours per day of viewing graphic content. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube's contractors gave little to no training or support for its moderators' mental health, made prospective employees sign NDAs before showing them any examples of content they would see while reviewing, and censored all mention of trauma from its internal forums. It also purports that requests for extremely graphic content to be blurred, reduced in size or made monochrome, per recommendations from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, were rejected by YouTube as not a high priority for the company.[316][317][318]\n\n\nTo limit the spread of misinformation and fake news via YouTube, it has rolled out a comprehensive policy regarding how it plans to deal with technically manipulated videos.[319]\n\n\nControversial content has included material relating to Holocaust denial and the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in 1989.[320][321] In July 2008, the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was \"unimpressed\" with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that \"proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content\". YouTube responded by stating:\n\n\n\n\n> We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly.[322] (July 2008)\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2010, U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner urged YouTube to remove from its website videos of imam Anwar al-Awlaki.[323] YouTube pulled some of the videos in November 2010, stating they violated the site's guidelines.[324] In December 2010, YouTube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content.[325]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube introduced a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other fake news, filling the infobox with content from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech.[326][327] In the wake of the Notre-Dame fire on April 15, 2019, several user-uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by YouTube' system automatically with an Encyclopædia Britannica article on the false conspiracy theories around the September 11 attacks. Several users complained to YouTube about this inappropriate connection. YouTube officials apologized for this, stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically, and were taking steps to remedy this.[328]\n\n\nOn April 18, 2023, YouTube revealed its changes in handling content associated with eating disorders. This social media platform's Community Guidelines now prohibit content that could encourage emulation from at-risk users. This content includes behavior that shows severe calorie tracking and purging after eating. However, videos featuring positive behavior such as in the context of recovery will be permitted on the platform under two conditions—the user must have a registered (logged-in) account and must be older than 18.\nThis policy was created in collaboration with nonprofit organizations as well as the National Eating Disorder Association. Garth Graham, YouTube's Global Head of Healthcare revealed in an interview with CNN that this policy change was geared at ensuring that this video-sharing platform provides an avenue for \"community recovery and resources\" while ensuring continued viewer protection.[329]\n\n\n\n#### Homophobia and transphobia[edit]\n\n\nFive leading content creators whose channels were based on LGBTQ+ materials filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube in August 2019, alleging that YouTube's algorithms divert discovery away from their channels, impacting their revenue. The plaintiffs claimed that the algorithms discourage content with words like \"lesbian\" or \"gay\", which would be predominant in their channels' content, and because of YouTube's near-monopolization of online video services, they are abusing that position.[330]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Media Matters, a media watchdog group, reported that homophobic and transphobic content calling LGBT people \"predators\" and \"groomers\" was becoming more common on YouTube.[331] The report also referred to common accusations in YouTube videos that LGBT people are mentally ill.[331] The report stated the content appeared to be in violation of YouTube's hate speech policy.[331]\n\n\n\n#### Animal torture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(July 2023)*\n |\n\n\nYouTube said animal abuse \"has no place on their platforms, and they are working to remove content\".[332][333][334][335][336][337]\n\n\n\n#### YouTube as a tool to promote conspiracy theories and far-right content[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been criticized for using an algorithm that gives great prominence to videos that promote conspiracy theories, falsehoods and incendiary fringe discourse.[338][339][340] According to an investigation by *The Wall Street Journal*, \"YouTube's recommendations often lead users to channels that feature conspiracy theories, partisan viewpoints and misleading videos, even when those users haven't shown interest in such content. When users show a political bias in what they choose to view, YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases, often with more-extreme viewpoints.\"[338][341] When users search for political or scientific terms, YouTube's search algorithms often give prominence to hoaxes and conspiracy theories.[340][342] After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking-news queries during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources.[338][343][344][345] In 2018, it was reported that YouTube was again promoting fringe content about breaking news, giving great prominence to conspiracy videos about Anthony Bourdain's death.[346]\n\n\nIn 2017, it was revealed that advertisements were being placed on extremist videos, including videos by rape apologists, anti-Semites, and hate preachers who received ad payouts.[347] After firms started to stop advertising on YouTube in the wake of this reporting, YouTube apologized and said that it would give firms greater control over where ads got placed.[347]\n\n\nAlex Jones, known for right-wing conspiracy theories, had built a massive audience on YouTube.[348] YouTube drew criticism in 2018 when it removed a video from Media Matters compiling offensive statements made by Jones, stating that it violated its policies on \"harassment and bullying\".[349] On August 6, 2018, however, YouTube removed Alex Jones' YouTube page following a content violation.[350]\n\n\nUniversity of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has referred to YouTube as \"The Great Radicalizer\", saying \"YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.\"[351] Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University described YouTube as a \"conspiracy ecosystem\".[340][352]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube said that it had introduced a new policy starting in the United States intended to stop recommending videos containing \"content that could misinform users in harmful ways.\" YouTube gave flat earth theories, miracle cures, and 9/11 trutherism as examples.[353] Efforts within YouTube engineering to stop recommending borderline extremist videos falling just short of forbidden hate speech, and track their popularity were originally rejected because they could interfere with viewer engagement.[354] In late 2019, the site began implementing measures directed towards \"raising authoritative content and reducing borderline content and harmful misinformation.\"[355]\n\n\nMultiple research studies have investigated cases of misinformation in YouTube. In a July 2019 study based on ten YouTube searches using the Tor Browser related to climate and climate change, the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change.[356] A May 2023 study found that YouTube was monetizing and profiting from videos that included misinformation about climate change.[357] A 2019 BBC investigation of YouTube searches in ten different languages found that YouTube's algorithm promoted health misinformation, including fake cancer cures.[358] In Brazil, YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters, as well as elevated far-right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories.[359] In the Philippines, numerous channels disseminated misinformation related to the 2022 Philippine elections.[360] Additionally, research on the dissemination of Flat Earth beliefs in social media, has shown that networks of YouTube channels form an echo chamber that polarizes audiences by appearing to confirm preexisting beliefs.[361]\n\n\n\n#### Use among white supremacists[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2019, YouTube took steps to remove specific videos or channels related to supremacist content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site-wide policies against hate speech.[362]\n\n\nIn the wake of the March 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks, YouTube and other sites like Facebook and Twitter that allowed user-submitted content drew criticism for doing little to moderate and control the spread of hate speech, which was considered to be a factor in the rationale for the attacks.[363][364] These platforms were pressured to remove such content, but in an interview with *The New York Times*, YouTube's chief product officer Neal Mohan said that unlike content such as ISIS videos which take a particular format and thus easy to detect through computer-aided algorithms, general hate speech was more difficult to recognize and handle, and thus could not readily take action to remove without human interaction.[365]\n\n\nYouTube joined an initiative led by France and New Zealand with other countries and tech companies in May 2019 to develop tools to be used to block online hate speech and to develop regulations, to be implemented at the national level, to be levied against technology firms that failed to take steps to remove such speech, though the United States declined to participate.[366][367] Subsequently, on June 5, 2019, YouTube announced a major change to its terms of service, \"specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.\" YouTube identified specific examples of such videos as those that \"promote or glorify Nazi ideology, which is inherently discriminatory\". YouTube further stated it would \"remove content denying that well-documented violent events, like the Holocaust or the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, took place.\"[362][368]\n\n\nIn October 2019, YouTube banned the main channel of Red Ice, a white supremacist multimedia company, for hate speech violations. The channel had about 330,000 subscribers. Lana Lokteff and Red Ice promoted a backup channel in an attempt to circumvent the ban.[369][370] A week later, the backup channel was also removed by YouTube.[371][372]\n\n\nIn June 2020, YouTube banned several channels associated with white supremacy, including those of Stefan Molyneux, David Duke, and Richard B. Spencer, asserting these channels violated their policies on hate speech. The ban occurred the same day that Reddit announced the ban on several hate speech sub-forums including r/The Donald.[373]\n\n\n\n#### Handling of COVID-19 pandemic and other misinformation[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the dissemination via YouTube of misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic that 5G communications technology was responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 which led to multiple 5G towers in the United Kingdom being attacked by arsonists, YouTube removed all such videos linking 5G and the coronavirus in this manner.[374]\n\n\nYouTube extended this policy in September 2021 to cover videos disseminating misinformation related to any vaccine, including those long approved against measles or Hepatitis B, that had received approval from local health authorities or the World Health Organization.[375][376] The platform removed the accounts of anti-vaccine campaigners such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Joseph Mercola at this time.[376] Two accounts linked to RT Deutsch, the German channel of the Russian RT network were removed as well for breaching YouTube's policies.[375]\n\n\nYouTube had extended this moderation to non-medical areas. In the weeks following the 2020 United States presidential election, the site added policies to remove or label videos promoting disproving election fraud claims;[377] however, it reversed this policy in June 2023, citing that the removal was necessary to \"openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial or based on disproven assumptions\".[378] Google and YouTube implemented policies in October 2021 to deny monetization or revenue to advertisers or content creators that promoted climate change denial, which \"includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.\"[379]\n\n\nIn July 2022 YouTube announced policies to combat misinformation surrounding abortion, such as videos with instructions to perform abortion methods that are considered unsafe and videos that contain misinformation about the safety of abortion.[380]\n\n\n\n#### Child safety and wellbeing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FamilyOFive, Fantastic Adventures scandal, and Elsagate\n\nLeading into 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children, coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family's activities, and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family-friendly material. In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90%.[381][382] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety. During Q2 2017, the owners of popular channel FamilyOFive, which featured themselves playing \"pranks\" on their children, were accused of child abuse. Their videos were eventually deleted, and two of their children were removed from their custody.[383][384][385][386] A similar case happened in 2019 when the owner of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children. Her videos would later be deleted.[387]\n\n\nLater that year, YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent, sexual or otherwise disturbing situations, many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views. The term \"Elsagate\" was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy.[388][389][390][391] On November 11, 2017, YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content. Later that month, the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family-friendly characters. As part of a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube, the wave of deletions also targeted channels that showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults. Most notably, the company removed *Toy Freaks*, a channel with over 8.5 million subscribers, that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations.[392][393][394][395][396] According to analytics specialist SocialBlade, it earned up to £8.7 million annually prior to its deletion.[397]\n\n\nEven for content that appears to be aimed at children and appears to contain only child-friendly content, YouTube's system allows for anonymity of who uploads these videos. These questions have been raised in the past, as YouTube has had to remove channels with children's content which, after becoming popular, then suddenly include inappropriate content masked as children's content.[398] Alternative, some of the most-watched children's programming on YouTube comes from channels that have no identifiable owners, raising concerns of intent and purpose. One channel that had been of concern was \"Cocomelon\" which provided numerous mass-produced animated videos aimed at children. Up through 2019, it had drawn up to US$10 million a month in ad revenue and was one of the largest kid-friendly channels on YouTube before 2020. Ownership of Cocomelon was unclear outside of its ties to \"Treasure Studio\", itself an unknown entity, raising questions as to the channel's purpose,[398][399][400] but *Bloomberg News* had been able to confirm and interview the small team of American owners in February 2020 regarding \"Cocomelon\", who stated their goal for the channel was to simply entertain children, wanting to keep to themselves to avoid attention from outside investors.[401] The anonymity of such channel raise concerns because of the lack of knowledge of what purpose they are trying to serve.[402] The difficulty to identify who operates these channels \"adds to the lack of accountability\", according to Josh Golin of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, and educational consultant Renée Chernow-O'Leary found the videos were designed to entertain with no intent to educate, all leading to critics and parents to be concerned for their children becoming too enraptured by the content from these channels.[398] Content creators that earnestly make child-friendly videos have found it difficult to compete with larger channels, unable to produce content at the same rate as them, and lacking the same means of being promoted through YouTube's recommendation algorithms that the larger animated channel networks have shared.[402]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube officially banned videos containing \"challenges that encourage acts that have an inherent risk of severe physical harm\" (such as the Tide Pod Challenge) and videos featuring pranks that \"make victims believe they're in physical danger\" or cause emotional distress in children.[403]\n\n\n\n##### Sexualization of children and pedophilia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Elsagate\n\nAlso in November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children—often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics—were attracting comments from pedophiles[404][405] with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian.[405] Other child-centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web, and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles.[406]\n\n\nAs a result of the controversy, which added to the concern about \"Elsagate\", several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube.[391][407] In December 2018, *The Times* found more than 100 grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior (such as taking off clothes, adopting overtly sexual poses and touching other children inappropriately) by strangers.[408] After a reporter flagged the videos in question, half of them were removed, and the rest were removed after *The Times* contacted YouTube's PR department.[408]\n\n\nIn February 2019, YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a \"wormhole\" that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content, and make all of that user's recommended content feature only these types of videos.[409] Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions or otherwise making indecent remarks. In some cases, other users had re-uploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos, and then monetized these, propagating this network.[410] In the wake of the controversy, the service reported that they had deleted over 400 channels and tens of millions of comments, and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A spokesperson explained that \"any content—including comments—that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.\"[411][412] Despite these measures, AT&T, Disney, Dr. Oetker, Epic Games, and Nestlé all pulled their advertising from YouTube.[410][413]\n\n\nSubsequently, YouTube began to demonetize and block advertising on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments. The service explained that this was a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem.[414] YouTube also began to flag channels that predominantly feature children, and preemptively disable their comments sections. \"Trusted partners\" can request that comments be re-enabled, but the channel will then become responsible for moderating comments. These actions mainly target videos of toddlers, but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual, such as gymnastics. YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators.[415][416]\n\n\nA related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string \"CP\" (an abbreviation of child pornography) resulted in some prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation, including videos related to the mobile video game *Pokémon Go* (which uses \"CP\" as an abbreviation of the statistic \"Combat Power\"), and *Club Penguin*. YouTube apologized for the errors and reinstated the affected videos.[417] Separately, online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said; this activity became an issue during the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in early 2019. YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity.[418]\n\n\nIn June 2019, *The New York Times* cited researchers who found that users who watched erotic videos could be recommended seemingly innocuous videos of children.[419] As a result, Senator Josh Hawley stated plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban YouTube and other video sharing sites from including videos that predominantly feature minors as \"recommended\" videos, excluding those that were \"professionally produced\", such as videos of televised talent shows.[420] YouTube has suggested potential plans to remove all videos featuring children from the main YouTube site and transferring them to the YouTube Kids site where they would have stronger controls over the recommendation system, as well as other major changes on the main YouTube site to the recommended feature and autoplay system.[421]\n\n\n\n#### Misogyny[edit]\n\n\nA January 2022 report by the social media analytics firm Bot Sentinel said that several online influencers were using YouTube to exclusively post negative content about Prince Harry and Meghan, including conspiracy theories about the couple, in what it called \"a lucrative hate-for-profit enterprise\" where \"racism and YouTube ad revenue are the primary motivators.\" Bot Sentinel also found that one of the most prominent accounts promoting a conspiracy theory that Meghan was never pregnant had accumulated nearly 19 million views and was earning around $44,000 a year. YouTube banned the account in March.[422]\n\n\nAn August 2022 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a British think tank, found that harassment against women was flourishing on YouTube. It noted that channels espousing a similar ideology to that of men's rights influencer Andrew Tate were using YouTube to grow their audience, despite Tate being banned from the platform.[423] In his 2022 book *Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise to World Domination*, Bloomberg reporter Mark Bergen said that many female content creators were dealing with harassment, bullying and stalking.[423]\n\n\n\n### April Fools gags[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Google April Fools' Day jokes\n\nYouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016. In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a prank known as \"rickrolling\".[424][425] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a \"new layout\".[426] In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a \"TEXTp\" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters \"in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.\"[427]\n\n\nThe next year, the site celebrated its \"100th anniversary\" with a range of sepia-toned silent, early 1900s-style films, including a parody of Keyboard Cat.[428] In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on DVD.[429]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company *The Onion* to claim in an uploaded video that the video-sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.[430][431]\n\n\nIn 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as \"Clocking\", \"Kissing Dad\", and \"Glub Glub Water Dance\".[432] The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from \"Sandstorm\" by Darude.[433] In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.[434]\n\n\n\n## Services[edit]\n\n\n### YouTube Premium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Premium\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Premium\nYouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers advertising-free streaming, access to original programming, and background and offline video playback on mobile devices.[435] YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as \"Music Key\", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music \"All Access\" service.[436][437][438] On October 28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos and access to exclusive original content.[439][440][441] As of November 2016[update], the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis.[442] As of June 2017[update], the first season of YouTube Originals had gotten 250 million views in total.[443]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Kids[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Kids\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Kids\nYouTube Kids is an American children's video app developed by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google. The app was developed in response to parental and government scrutiny on the content available to children. The app provides a version of the service-oriented towards children, with curated selections of content, parental control features, and filtering of videos deemed inappropriate viewing for children aged under 13, 8 or 5 depending on the age grouping chosen. First released on February 15, 2015, as an Android and iOS mobile app, the app has since been released for LG, Samsung, and Sony smart TVs, as well as for Android TV. On May 27, 2020, it became available on Apple TV. As of September 2019, the app is available in 69 countries, including Hong Kong and Macau, and one province. YouTube launched a web-based version of YouTube Kids on August 30, 2019.\n\n\n\n### YouTube Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Music\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Music\nOn September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the co-founder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music Group executive, the Global Head of Music.[444]\n\n\nIn early 2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a platform that would compete with other services such as Spotify and Apple Music.[445] On May 22, 2018, the music streaming platform named \"YouTube Music\" was launched.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Movies[edit]\n\n\nYouTube Movies is a service by YouTube that shows movies via its website. Around 100–500 movies are free to view, with ads. Some new movies get added and some get removed, unannounced at a new month.[448]\n\n\n\n### YouTube TV[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube TV\n\n![](image)YouTube TV logo\nOn February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$65 per month. Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017,[449][450] the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC), as well as approximately 40 cable channels owned by the corporate parents of those networks, The Walt Disney Company, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal and Turner Broadcasting System (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN). Subscribers can also receive Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Premium original content.[451][452]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Go[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Go\nIn September 2016, *YouTube Go* was announced,[453] as an Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets. It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users. It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution.[454]\n\n\nIn February 2017, *YouTube Go* was launched in India, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South Africa.[455][456] On February 1, 2018, it was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq. Before it shut down, the app was available to around 60% of the world's population.[457][458] In May 2022, Google announced that they would be shutting down *YouTube Go* in August 2022.[459]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Shorts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Shorts\n\nAn example video that is suitable for YouTube Shorts, showing Crew Dragon *Endeavour* docking at the International Space Station\nIn September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts.[460][461] The platform was first tested in India but as of March 2021 has expanded to other countries including the United States with videos now able to be up to 1 minute long.[462] The platform is not a standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app. Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools, including the possibility of adding licensed music to their videos.[463] The platform had its global beta launch in July 2021.[464]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Stories[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube started testing a new feature initially called \"YouTube Reels\".[465] The feature is nearly identical to Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories. YouTube later renamed the feature \"YouTube Stories\". It is only available to creators who have more than 10,000 subscribers and can only be posted/seen in the YouTube mobile app.[466] On May 25, 2023, YouTube announced that it would be shutting down this feature on June 26, 2023.[467][468]\n\n\n\n## Social impact[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social impact of YouTube\n\nPrivate individuals[469] and large production corporations[470] have used YouTube to grow their audiences. Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic.[469] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television.[470] While YouTube's revenue-sharing \"Partner Program\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually[471] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million[472]—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \"a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels.\"[473] In 2013 *Forbes*' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.[474] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \"mega\", \"mainstream\" and \"mid-sized\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year.[475] By early 2013, *Billboard* had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the *Billboard* Hot 100 and related genre charts.[476]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan Hoffner at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards accepting for YouTube\nObserving that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been \"fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution\", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that \"what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication.\"[477] Anderson asserted that it is not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch \"the biggest learning cycle in human history.\"[477] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what *Forbes'* Michael Noer called \"the largest school in the world,\" with technology poised to disrupt how people learn.[478] YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award,[479] the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that \"both embodies and promotes democracy.\"[480] *The Washington Post* reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white.[481] A Pew Research Center study reported the development of \"visual journalism\", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation.[482] The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.[483]\n\n\nYouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape.[484] Describing the Arab Spring (2010–2012), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using \"Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.\"[485] In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the \"Kony 2012\" video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video \"will do more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined.\"[486]\n\n\n\n![](image)Leading YouTube content creators met at the White House with U.S. President Obama to discuss how government could better connect with the \"YouTube generation.\"[487][488]\nConversely, YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012[489] and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance.[490] In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare[491] but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the \"YouTube Generation.\"[487] Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.[487]\n\n\nSome YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as *Innocence of Muslims* (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.[492] TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.[477] Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in *The New York Times* that such videos have \"surprising implications\" for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.[493]\n\n\nA 2017 article in *The New York Times Magazine* posited that YouTube had become \"the new talk radio\" for the far right.[494] Almost a year before YouTube's January 2019 announcement that it would begin a \"gradual change\" of \"reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways\",[495] Zeynep Tufekci had written in *The New York Times* that, \"(g)iven its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century\".[496] Under YouTube's changes to its recommendation engine, the most recommended channel evolved from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (2016) to Fox News (2019).[497] According to a 2020 study, \"An emerging journalistic consensus theorizes the central role played by the video 'recommendation engine,' but we believe that this is premature. Instead, we propose the 'Supply and Demand' framework for analyzing politics on YouTube.\"[498] A 2022 study found that \"despite widespread concerns that YouTube's algorithms send people down 'rabbit holes' with recommendations to extremist videos, little systematic evidence exists to support this conjecture\", \"exposure to alternative and extremist channel videos on YouTube is heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment.\", and \"contrary to the 'rabbit holes' narrative, non-subscribers are rarely recommended videos from alternative and extremist channels and seldom follow such recommendations when offered.\"[499]\n\n\n*The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers*[500] and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra[501] selected their membership based on individual video performances.[477][501] Further, the cybercollaboration charity video \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)\" was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work,[502] with *The Tokyo Times* noting the \"We Pray for You\" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.[503]\nThe anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens,[504] that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet secretaries.[505] Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video \"My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm,\" legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy.[506] In May 2018, after London Metropolitan Police claimed that drill music videos glamorizing violence gave rise to gang violence, YouTube deleted 30 videos.[507]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nPrior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as \"not material\" in a regulatory filing.[508] In June 2008, a *Forbes* magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.[509] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion.[510] In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to eMarketer,[510][511] while others estimated $4.7 billion.[510] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising.[62] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month.[512] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.[62]\n\n\nGoogle first published exact revenue numbers for YouTube in February 2020 as part of Alphabet's 2019 financial report. According to Google, YouTube had made US$15.1 billion in ad revenue in 2019, in contrast to US$8.1 billion in 2017 and US$11.1 billion in 2018. YouTube's revenues made up nearly 10% of the total Alphabet revenue in 2019.[513][514] These revenues accounted for approximately 20 million subscribers combined between YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions, and 2 million subscribers to YouTube TV.[515]\n\n\nYouTube had $19.8 billion in revenue in 2020.[516]\n\n\n\n### Partnership with corporations[edit]\n\n\nYouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[517] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment.[518] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called \"Shows\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[519][520] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[521] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service,[522] which is only available to users in the United States, Canada, and the UK as of 2010.[523][524][*needs update*] The service offers over 6,000 films.[525]\n\n\n\n#### 2017 advertiser boycott[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would \"be delivered safely and appropriately\". *The Guardian* newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had \"begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear\".[526][527] In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a *Wall Street Journal* article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.[528][529]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2017, YouTube announced that to \"ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules\", it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000-lifetime views, before they may join the Partner Program.[530]\n\n\n\n### YouTuber earnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Total annual earnings of the top ten YouTuber accounts, and the income of the single highest-earning account.\nIn May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site.[531] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.[532][533]\n\n\nThere are over two million members of the YouTube Partner Program.[534] According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually, no more than half of the eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.[535]\n\n\nYouTube's policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising, including videos containing violence, strong language, sexual content, \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\" (unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\"),[536] and videos whose user comments contain \"inappropriate\" content.[537]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos.[538][539] In April 2017, YouTube set an eligibility requirement of 10,000 lifetime views for a paid subscription.[540] On January 16, 2018, the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to 4,000 hours of watch-time within the past 12 months and 1,000 subscribers.[540] The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to controversy, but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels.[541]\n\n\nYouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.[542] The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal, ruby, and red tinted crystal glass are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million, fifty million subscribers, and one hundred million subscribers, respectively.[543][544]\n\n\nYouTube's policies on \"advertiser-friendly content\" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized; this includes strong violence, language,[545] sexual content, and \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\", unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\".[546] In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent users, including Phillip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was \"censorship by a different name\". A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new, the service had \"improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators\".[547][548][549] *Boing Boing* reported in 2019 that LGBT keywords resulted in demonetization.[550]\n\n\nAs of November 2020 in the United States and June 2021 worldwide,[551] YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform, even if their uploader is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program. This will occur on channels whose content is deemed \"advertiser-friendly\", and all revenue will go directly to Google without any share given to the uploader.[552]\n\n\n\n### Revenue to copyright holders[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: § Copyrighted material\n\nThe majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue.[553] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders. YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue.[554] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games.[555] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program.[556][557][558] On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program. Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019.[559][560]\n\n\n\n## Censorship and bans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Censorship of YouTube\n\n![](image)Availability of YouTube as of January 2021:  \n Has local YouTube version\n Accessible (Worldwide version)\n Currently blocked\n Previously blocked\n\nYouTube has been censored, filtered, or banned for a variety of reasons, including:[561]\n\n\n\n* Limiting public access and exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest.\n* Preventing criticism of a ruler (e.g. in North Korea), government (e.g. in China) or its actions (e.g. in Morocco), government officials (e.g. in Turkey and Libya), or religion (e.g. in Pakistan).\n* Morality-based laws, e.g. in Iran.\n\n\nAccess to specific videos is sometimes prevented due to copyright and intellectual property protection laws (e.g. in Germany), violations of hate speech, and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate for youth,[562] which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with \"restricted mode\".[563] Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to its bandwidth limitations[564][565] and the site's potential for distraction.[561][566]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], public access to YouTube is blocked in many countries, including China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan,[567] Uzbekistan,[568][569] Tajikistan, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. In some countries, YouTube is blocked for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.[561]\n\n\nReports emerged that since October 2019, comments posted with Chinese characters insulting the Chinese Communist Party (共匪 or \"communist bandit\") or (五毛 or \"50 Cent Party\", referring to state-sponsored commentators) were being automatically deleted within 15 seconds.[570]\n\n\nSpecific incidents where YouTube has been blocked include:\n\n\n\n* Thailand blocked access in April 2007 over a video said to be insulting the Thai king.[571]\n* Morocco blocked access in May 2007, possibly as a result of videos critical of Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara.[572] YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007, after *Maroc Telecom* unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere \"technical glitch\".[573]\n* Turkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.[574][575][576] In November 2010, a video of the Turkish politician Deniz Baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly, and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video.[577] During the two and a half-year block of YouTube, the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed site in Turkey.[578][579] In 2014, Turkey blocked the access for the second time, after \"a high-level intelligence leak.\"[580][581][582]\n* Pakistan blocked access on February 23, 2008, because of \"offensive material\" towards the Islamic faith, including display of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.[583] This led to a near global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours, as the Pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries. On February 26, 2008, the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government.[584][585] Many Pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private network software.[586] In May 2010, following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube, citing \"growing sacrilegious content\".[587] The ban was lifted on May 27, 2010, after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government. However, individual videos deemed offensive to Muslims posted on YouTube will continue to be blocked.[588][589] Pakistan again placed a ban on YouTube in September 2012, after the site refused to remove the film *Innocence of Muslims*. The ban was lifted in January 2016 after YouTube launched a Pakistan-specific version.[590]\n* Libya blocked access on January 24, 2010, because of videos that featured demonstrations in the city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch.[591] In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.[592]\n* Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sudan blocked access in September 2012 following controversy over a 14-minute trailer for the film *Innocence of Muslims* which had been posted on the site.[593][594][595][596][597] A court in the southern Russian Republic of Chechnya ruled that *Innocence of Muslims* should be banned.[598] In Libya and Egypt, it was blamed for violent protests. YouTube stated: \"This video—which is widely available on the Web—is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries.\"[599][600]\n* Russia threatened to ban YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021.[601] Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube announced on March 1 the immediate removal of RT (and other Russian-government funded outlets) from its platform in Europe.[602]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Invidious, a free and open-source alternative frontend to YouTube\n* Alternative media\n* BookTube\n* BreadTube\n* CNN/YouTube presidential debates\n* Lists\n\t+ Comparison of video hosting services\n\t+ List of Google Easter eggs#YouTube\n\t+ List of Internet phenomena\n\t+ List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-liked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n\t+ List of online video platforms\n\t+ List of YouTubers\n* Lawsuits\n\t+ *Viacom International Inc. v.

The company owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services.[20] Meta is one of the world's most valuable companies and among the ten largest publicly traded corporations in the United States.[21] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Google's parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\n\nIn addition to Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, Meta has also acquired Oculus (which it has integrated into Reality Labs), Mapillary, CTRL-Labs, and a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms; the company additionally endeavored into non-VR hardware, such as the discontinued Meta Portal smart displays line and presently partners with Luxottica through the Ray-Ban Stories series of smart glasses.[22][23] Despite endeavors into hardware, the company still relies on advertising for a vast majority of its revenue, which in 2022 made up 97.5 percent of its revenue.[12]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2021, the parent company of Facebook changed its name from Facebook, Inc., to Meta Platforms, Inc., to \"reflect its focus on building the metaverse\".[24] According to Meta, the term \"metaverse\" refers to the integrated environment that links all of the company's products and services.[25][26][27]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Facebook and Initial public offering of Facebook\n\n![](image)Billboard on the Thomson Reuters building welcomes Facebook to Nasdaq, 2012\n![](image)Early chart of Facebook's stock\n![](image)Facebook corporate logo from 2019 to 2021\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series about |\n| Meta Platforms |\n| ![](image) |\n| * History\n\t+ Instagram\n\t+ WhatsApp\n* Acquisitions\n |\n| \nProducts and services |\n| Facebook\n* 2021 outage\n* Features\n\t+ Dating\n\t+ Feed\n\t+ Like button\n |\n| Other products\n* Instagram\n\t+ Threads\n* Messenger\n\t+ Kids\n* Meta AI\n* Meta Portal\n* Quest\n\t+ Quest 2\n\t+ Quest 3\n\t+ Supernatural\n* Ray-Ban Stories\n* WhatsApp\n |\n| \nPeople |\n| Executives and board members\n* Mark Zuckerberg\n* Sheryl Sandberg\n |\n| Notable employees\n* Adam Mosseri\n |\n| Related organizations\n* Oversight Board\n |\n| \nBusiness |\n| Criticism\n* Privacy concerns\n* Content management\n\t+ Censorship of\n\t+ Censorship by\n* Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n* 2020 ad boycotts\n* 2021 company files leak\n* WhatsApp security and privacy features\n* WhatsApp snooping scandal\n |\n| Litigation\n* *Young v.

IPO\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nFacebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on January 1, 2012.[28] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company sought to raise $5 billion, had 845 million monthly active users, and a website accruing 2.7 billion likes and comments daily.[29] After the IPO, Zuckerberg would retain a 22% ownership share in Facebook and would own 57% of the voting shares.[30]\n\n\nUnderwriters valued the shares at $38 each, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly public company.[31] On May 16, one day before the IPO, Facebook announced it would sell 25% more shares than originally planned due to high demand.[32] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third-largest in US history (slightly ahead of AT&T Wireless and behind only General Motors and Visa). The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations—surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, and Kraft Foods—and made Zuckerberg's stock worth $19 billion.[33][34] *The New York Times* stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook's difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a \"must-own stock\". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as \"the next great blue-chip\".[33] Writers at TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, \"That's a big multiple to live up to, and Facebook will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation.\"[35]\n\n\nTrading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the Nasdaq exchange.[36] The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.[37] At the closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[38] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.[39] The stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[40] On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[41]\n\n\nOn May 22, 2012, regulators from Wall Street's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients rather than the general public. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue.[42] The allegations sparked \"fury\" among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits, one of them a class action suit claiming more than $2.5 billion in losses due to the IPO.[43] Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook stock since its debut.[44] Standard & Poor's added Facebook to its S&P 500 index on December 21, 2013.[45]\n\n\nOn May 2, 2014, Zuckerberg announced that the company would be changing its internal motto from \"Move fast and break things\" to \"Move fast with stable infrastructure\".[46][47] The earlier motto had been described as Zuckerberg's \"prime directive to his developers and team\" in a 2009 interview in *Business Insider*, in which he also said, \"Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2020: Focus on the metaverse[edit]\n\n\nLasso was a short-video sharing app from Facebook similar to TikTok that was launched on iOS and Android in 2018 and was aimed at teenagers. On July 2, 2020, Facebook announced that Lasso would be shutting down on July 10.[49][50][51]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Oculus lead, Jason Rubin, sent his 50-page vision document titled \"The Metaverse\" to Facebook's leadership. In the document, Rubin acknowledged that Facebook's virtual reality business had not caught on as expected, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on content for early adopters. He also urged the company to execute fast and invest heavily in the vision, to shut out HTC, Apple, Google and other competitors in the VR space. Regarding other players' participation in the metaverse vision, he called for the company to build the \"metaverse\" to prevent their competitors from \"being in the VR business in a meaningful way at all\".[52]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Facebook founded Libra Networks, reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency.[53] Later, it was reported that Libra was being supported by financial companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber. The consortium of companies was expected to pool in $10 million each to fund the launch of the cryptocurrency coin named Libra.[54] Depending on when it would receive approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory authority to operate as a payments service, the Libra Association had planned to launch a limited format cryptocurrency in 2021.[55] Libra was renamed Diem, before being shut down and sold in January 2022 after backlash from government regulators and the public.[56][57]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of online services including Facebook grew globally.[58] Zuckerberg predicted this would be a \"permanent acceleration\" that would continue after the pandemic.[58] Facebook hired aggressively, growing from 48,268 employees in March 2020 to more than 87,000 by September 2022.[58]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Rebrand as Meta[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Criticism of Facebook, Instagram § Impact on people, 2021 Facebook leak, and Frances Haugen\nSee also: Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal and 2020 Facebook ad boycotts\n\nFollowing a period of intense scrutiny and damaging whistleblower leaks, news started to emerge on October 21, 2021, about Facebook's plan to rebrand the company and to change its name.[59][60] In the Q3 2021 Earnings Call, on October 25, Mark Zuckerberg discussed the ongoing criticism of the company's social services and the way it operates, and pointed to the pivoting efforts to building the metaverse – without mentioning the rebranding and the name change.[61] The metaverse vision and the name change from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms was introduced at Facebook Connect on October 28, 2021.[62] Based on Facebook's PR campaign, the name change reflects the company's shifting long term focus of building the metaverse, a digital extension of the physical world by social media, virtual reality and augmented reality features.[62][63]\n\n\n\"Meta\" had been registered as a trademark in the United States in 2018 (after an initial filing in 2015) for marketing, advertising, and computer services, by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis of scientific literature.[64] This company was acquired in 2017 by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a foundation established by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, and became one of their projects.[65] Following the rebranding announcement, CZI announced that it had already decided to deprioritize the earlier Meta project, that it would be transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms, and that the project would end in 2022.[66]\n\n\n\n### 2022–present: Declining profits and mass layoffs[edit]\n\n\nSoon after the rebranding, in early February 2022, Meta reported a greater-than-expected decline in profits in the fourth quarter of 2021.[67] It reported no growth in monthly users,[68] and indicated it expected revenue growth to stall.[67] It also expected measures taken by Apple, Inc. to protect user privacy to cost it some $10 billion in advertisement revenue, an amount equal to roughly 8% of its revenue for 2021.[69] In meeting with Meta staff the day after earnings were reported, Zuckerberg blamed competition for user attention, particularly from video-based apps such as TikTok.[70]\n\n\nThe 27% reduction in the company's share price which occurred in reaction to the news eliminated some $230 billion of value from Meta's market capitalization.[71] Bloomberg described the decline as \"an epic rout that, in its sheer scale, is unlike anything Wall Street or Silicon Valley has ever seen\".[71] Zuckerberg's net worth fell by as much as $31 billion.[72] Zuckerberg owns 13% of Meta, and the holding makes up the bulk of his wealth.[73][74]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg on March 30, 2022, Meta turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, a Meta representative said, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[75] In June 2022, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of 14 years, announced she would step down that year. Zuckerberg said that Javier Olivan would replace Sandberg, though in a \"more traditional\" role.[76]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Meta (except Meta-owned WhatsApp) and Instagram were banned in Russia and added to Russian list of terrorist and extremist organizations for alleged Russophobia amid ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.[77] Meta appealed against the ban but it was upheld by a Moscow court in June of the same year.[77]\n\n\nAlso in March 2022, Meta and Italian eyewear giant Luxottica released Ray-Ban Stories, a series of smartglasses which could play music and take pictures. Meta and Luxottica parent company EssilorLuxottica declined to disclose sales on the line of products as of September 2022, though Meta has expressed satisfaction with its customer feedback.[23][78][79]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Meta saw its first year-on-year revenue decline when its total revenue slipped by 1% to $28.8bn.[80] Analysts and journalists accredited the loss to its advertising business, which has been limited by Apple's app tracking transparency feature and the number of people who have opted not to be tracked by Meta apps. Zuckerberg also accredited the decline to increasing competition from TikTok.[81][82][83] On October 27, 2022, Meta's market value dropped to $268 billion, a loss of around $700 billion compared to 2021, and its shares fell by 24%. It lost its spot among the top 20 US companies by market cap, despite reaching the top 5 in the previous year.[84]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, 13% of its workforce. Zuckerberg said the decision to aggressively increase Meta's investments had been a mistake, as he had wrongly predicted that the surge in e-commerce would last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. He also attributed the decline to increased competition, a global economic downturn and \"ads signal loss\".[85] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in April 2023.[86] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[87][88]\n\n\nMeta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI.[89] On July 6, 2023, Meta launched a new app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[90]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the company announced it was making Llama 2, its artificial intelligence model, available for commercial use via partnerships with major cloud providers like Microsoft. This was the first project to be unveiled out of Meta's generative AI group after it was set up in February. It would not charge access or usage but instead operate with an open-source model to allow Meta to ascertain what improvements need to be made. Prior to this announcement, Meta said it had no plans to release Llama 2 for commercial use. An earlier version of Llama was released to academics.[91][92]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Meta announced its permanent removal of news content from Facebook and Instagram in Canada due to the *Online News Act*, which requires Canadian news outlets to be compensated for content shared on its platform. The Online News Act will be effective by year-end, but Meta will not participate in the regulatory process.[93]\n\n\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of mergers and acquisitions by Meta Platforms.\n\nMeta has acquired multiple companies (often identified as talent acquisitions).[94] One of its first major acquisitions was in April 2012, when it acquired Instagram for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.[95] In October 2013, Facebook, Inc. acquired Onavo, an Israeli mobile web analytics company.[96][97] In February 2014, Facebook, Inc. announced it would buy mobile messaging company WhatsApp for US$19 billion in cash and stock.[98][99] Later that year, Facebook bought Oculus VR for $2.3 billion in cash and stock,[100] which released its first consumer virtual reality headset in 2016. In late November 2019, Facebook, Inc. announced the acquisition of the game developer Beat Games, responsible for developing one of that year's most popular VR games, *Beat Saber*.[101] In Late 2022 after Facebook Inc rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc, Oculus was rebranded to Meta Quest.\n\n\nIn May 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced it had acquired Giphy for a reported cash price of $400 million. It will be integrated with the Instagram team.[102] However, in August 2021, UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated that Facebook, Inc. might have to sell Giphy, after an investigation found that the deal between the two companies would harm competition in display advertising market.[103] Facebook, Inc. was fined $70 million by CMA for deliberately failing to report all information regarding the acquisition and the ongoing antitrust investigation.[104] In October 2022, the CMA ruled for a second time that Meta be required to divest Giphy, stating that Meta already controls half of the advertising in the UK. Meta agreed to the sale, though it stated that it disagrees with the decision itself.[105] In May 2023, Giphy was divested to Shutterstock for $53 million.[106]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced that it planned to purchase the customer-service platform and chatbot specialist startup Kustomer to promote companies to use their platform for business. It has been reported that Kustomer valued at slightly over $1 billion.[107] The deal was closed in February 2022 after regulatory approval.[108]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Meta acquired Lofelt, a Berlin-based haptic tech startup.[109]\n\n\n\n## Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, Facebook, Inc. spent $19.7 million on lobbying, hiring 79 lobbyists. By 2019, it had spent $16.7 million on lobbying and had a team of 71 lobbyists, up from $12.6 million and 51 lobbyists in 2018.[110] Facebook was the largest spender of lobbying money among the Big Tech companies in 2020.[111] The lobbying team includes top congressional aide John Branscome, who was hired in September 2021, to help the company fend off threats from Democratic lawmakers and the Biden administration.[112]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lawsuits involving Meta Platforms\n\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed against the company, both when it was known as Facebook, Inc., and as Meta Platforms.\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) sued Facebook, for significant and persistent infringements of the rule on privacy involving the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. Every violation of the Privacy Act is subject to a theoretical cumulative liability of $1.7 million. The OAIC estimated that a total of 311,127 Australians had been exposed.[113]\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and 46 states (excluding Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and South Dakota), the District of Columbia and the territory of Guam, launched *Federal Trade Commission v. Facebook* as an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook. The lawsuit concerns Facebook's acquisition of two competitors—Instagram and WhatsApp—and the ensuing monopolistic situation. FTC alleges that Facebook holds monopolistic power in the US social networking market and seeks to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp to break up the conglomerate.[114] William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued the case will be difficult to win as it would require the government to create a counterfactual argument of an internet where the Facebook-WhatsApp-Instagram entity did not exist, and prove that harmed competition or consumers.[115]\n\n\nOn December 24, 2021, a court in Russia fined Meta for $27 million after the company declined to remove unspecified banned content. The fine was reportedly tied to the company's annual revenue in the country.[116]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Kenya against Meta and its local outsourcing company Sama. Allegedly, Meta has poor working conditions in Kenya for workers moderating Facebook posts. According to the lawsuit, 260 screeners were declared redundant with confusing reasoning. The lawsuit seeks financial compensation and an order that outsourced moderators be given the same health benefits and pay scale as Meta employees.[117][118]\n\n\nIn June 2022, 8 lawsuits were filed across the US over the allege that excessive exposure to platforms including Facebook and Instagram has led to attempted or actual suicides, eating disorders and sleeplessness, among other issues. The litigation follows a former Facebook employee's testimony in Congress that the company refused to take responsibility. The company noted that tools have been developed for parents to keep track of their children's activity on Instagram and set time limits in addition to Meta's \"Take a break\" reminders. In addition, the company is providing resources specific to eating disorders as well as developing AI to prevent children under the age of 13 signing up for Facebook or Instagram.[119]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Meta settled a lawsuit with the US Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019, alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through targeted advertising, as it allowed home owners and landlords to run housing ads excluding people based on sex, race, religion, and other characteristics. The US Department of Justice stated that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Meta was handed a penalty of $115,054 and given until December 31, 2022, to shadow the algorithm tool.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Meta was fined €390 million for violations of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.[123]\n\n\nIn May 2023, the European Data Protection Board fined Meta a record €1.2 billion for breaching European Union data privacy laws by transferring personal data of Facebook users to servers in the U.S.[124]\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Meta, in 2012\n### Management[edit]\n\n\nMeta's key management consists of:[125][126]\n\n\n\n* Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and chief executive officer\n* Javier Olivan, chief operating officer\n* Sir Nick Clegg, president, global affairs\n* Susan Li, chief financial officer\n* Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer\n* David Wehner, chief strategy officer\n* Chris Cox, chief product officer\n* Jennifer Newstead, chief legal officer\n\n\nAs of October 2022[update], Meta had 83,553 employees worldwide.\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 2023, Meta's board consisted of the following directors;[127]\n\n\n\n* Mark Zuckerberg (chairman, co-founder, controlling shareholder, and chief executive officer)\n* Sheryl Sandberg (non-executive director and former chief operating officer)\n* Peggy Alford (non-executive director, executive vice president, global sales, PayPal)\n* Marc Andreessen (non-executive director, co-founder and general partner, Andreessen Horowitz)\n* Drew Houston (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, Dropbox)\n* Nancy Killefer (non-executive director, senior partner, McKinsey & Company)\n* Robert M. Kimmitt (non-executive director, senior international counsel, WilmerHale)\n* Tracey Travis (non-executive director, executive vice president, chief financial officer, Estée Lauder Companies)\n* Tony Xu (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, DoorDash)\n\n\n### Company governance[edit]\n\n\nEarly Facebook investor and Zuckerberg's former mentor, Roger McNamee described Facebook as having \"the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company.\"[128] Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder argued for transforming Facebook into a platform cooperative owned and governed by the users.[129]\n\n\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes has stated that chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, that the company is now a monopoly, and that, as a result, it should be split into multiple smaller companies. In an op-ed in *The New York Times*, Hughes said he was concerned that Zuckerberg had surrounded himself with a team that did not challenge him, and that it is the U.S. government's job to hold him accountable and curb his \"unchecked power\".[130] He also said that \"Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American.\"[131] Several U.S. politicians agreed with Hughes.[132] European Union Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager stated that splitting Facebook should be done only as \"a remedy of the very last resort\", and that it would not solve Facebook's underlying problems.[133]\n\n\n\n## Revenue[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRevenue  \n(in millions USD)\n| Year | Revenue | Growth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | $0.4[134] | —\n |\n| 2005 | $9[134] | 2150%\n |\n| 2006 | $48[134] | 433%\n |\n| 2007 | $153[134] | 219%\n |\n| 2008 | $280[135] | 83%\n |\n| 2009 | $775[136] | 177%\n |\n| 2010 | $2,000[137] | 158%\n |\n| 2011 | $3,711[138] | 86%\n |\n| 2012 | $5,089[139] | 37%\n |\n| 2013 | $7,872[139] | 55%\n |\n| 2014 | $12,466[140] | 58%\n |\n| 2015 | $17,928[141] | 44%\n |\n| 2016 | $27,638[142] | 54%\n |\n| 2017 | $40,653[143] | 47%\n |\n| 2018 | $55,838[144] | 37%\n |\n| 2019 | $70,697[144] | 27%\n |\n| 2020 | $85,965[145] | 22%\n |\n| 2021 | $117,929[146] | 37%\n |\n| 2022 | $116,609[13] | -1%\n |\n\n\nFacebook ranked No. 34 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue, with almost $86 billion in revenue[147] most of it coming from advertising.[148][149] One analysis of 2017 data determined that the company earned US$20.21 per user from advertising.[150]\n\n\nAccording to *New York*, since its rebranding, Meta has reportedly lost $500 billion as a result of new privacy measures put in place by companies such as Apple and Google which prevents Meta from gathering users' data.[151][152]\n\n\n\n### Number of advertisers[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Facebook announced it had reached two million active advertisers, with most of the gain coming from small businesses. An active advertiser was defined as an entity that had advertised on the Facebook platform in the last 28 days.[153] In March 2016, Facebook announced it had reached three million active advertisers with more than 70% from outside the United States.[154] Prices for advertising follow a variable pricing model based on auctioning ad placements, and potential engagement levels of the advertisement itself. Similar to other online advertising platforms like Google and Twitter, targeting of advertisements is one of the chief merits of digital advertising compared to traditional media. Marketing on Meta is employed through two methods based on the viewing habits, likes and shares, and purchasing data of the audience, namely targeted audiences and \"look alike\" audiences.[155]\n\n\n\n### Tax affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes, and Double Irish arrangement § Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\nThe US IRS challenged the valuation Facebook used when it transferred IP from the US to Facebook Ireland (now Meta Platforms Ireland) in 2010 (which Facebook Ireland then revalued higher before charging out), as it was building its double Irish tax structure.[156][157] The case is ongoing and Meta faces a potential fine of $3–5bn.[158]\n\n\nThe US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed Facebook's global tax calculations. Meta Platforms Ireland is subject to the US GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if its Irish business relocated to the US. Tax relief in the US (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective US rate around 12%.[159][160][161]\n\n\nThe insignificance of the US/Irish tax difference was demonstrated when Facebook moved 1.5bn non-EU accounts to the US to limit exposure to GDPR.[162][163]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nUsers outside of the US and Canada contract with Meta's Irish subsidiary, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly *Facebook Ireland Limited*), allowing Meta to avoid US taxes for all users in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. Meta is making use of the Double Irish arrangement which allows it to pay 2–3% corporation tax on all international revenue.[164] In 2010, Facebook opened its fourth office, in Hyderabad, India,[165] which houses online advertising and developer support teams and provides support to users and advertisers.[166] In India, Meta is registered as Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd.[167] It also has support centers in Chittagong; Dublin;[*clarification needed*] California; Ireland; and Austin, Texas.[168][*not specific enough to verify*]\n\n\nFacebook opened its London headquarters in 2017 in Fitzrovia in central London. Facebook opened an office in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2018. The offices were initially home to the \"Connectivity Lab\", a group focused on bringing Internet access to those who do not have access to the Internet.[169] In April 2019, Facebook opened its Taiwan headquarters in Taipei.[170]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Meta opened new regional headquarters in Dubai.[171]\n\n\nIn September 2023, it was reported that Meta had paid £149m to British Land in order to break the lease on Triton Square London office. Meta reportedly had another 18 years left on its lease on the site. [172]\n\n\n\n* ![Entrance to Meta's headquarters complex in Menlo Park, California](image)\n\nEntrance to Meta's headquarters complex in Menlo Park, California\n\n\n* ![Entrance to Facebook's previous headquarters in the Stanford Research Park, Palo Alto, California](image)\n\nEntrance to Facebook's previous headquarters in the Stanford Research Park, Palo Alto, California\n\n\n* ![Inside the Facebook headquarters in 2014](image)\n\nInside the Facebook headquarters in 2014\n\n\n\n### Data centers[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Facebook operated 21 data centers.[173] It committed to purchase 100% renewable energy and to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 75% by 2020.[174] Its data center technologies include Fabric Aggregator, a distributed network system that accommodates larger regions and varied traffic patterns.[175]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Criticism of Facebook, Privacy concerns with Facebook, and Censorship by Facebook\n\nUS Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet to Zuckerberg's announcement about Meta, saying: \"Meta as in 'we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society ... for profit!'\"[176]\n\n\nEx-Facebook employee Frances Haugen and whistleblower behind the Facebook Papers responded to the rebranding efforts by expressing doubts about the company's ability to improve while led by Mark Zuckerberg, and urged the chief executive officer to resign.[177]\n\n\nIn November 2021, a video published by Inspired by Iceland went viral, in which a Zuckerberg look-alike promoted the Icelandverse, a place of \"enhanced actual reality without silly looking headsets\".[178]\n\n\nIn a December 2021 interview, SpaceX and Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk said he could not see a compelling use-case for the VR-driven metaverse, adding: \"I don't see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day.\"[179]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Louise Eccles of *The Sunday Times* logged into the metaverse with the intention of making a video guide. She wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Initially, my experience with the Oculus went well. I attended work meetings as an avatar and tried an exercise class set in the streets of Paris. The headset enabled me to feel the thrill of carving down mountains on a snowboard and the adrenaline rush of climbing a mountain without ropes. Yet switching to the social apps, where you mingle with strangers also using VR headsets, it was at times predatory and vile.\n> \n> \n\n\nEccles described being sexually harassed by another user, as well as \"accents from all over the world, American, Indian, English, Australian, using racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic language\". She also encountered users as young as 7 years old on the platform, despite Oculus headsets being intended for users over 13.[180]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Big Tech\n* Criticism of Facebook\n* Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n* 2021 Facebook leak\n* Meta AI\n* *The Social Network*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Madrigal, Alexis C.

The company owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services.[20] Meta is one of the world's most valuable companies and among the ten largest publicly traded corporations in the United States.[21] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Google's parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\n\nIn addition to Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, Meta has also acquired Oculus (which it has integrated into Reality Labs), Mapillary, CTRL-Labs, and a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms; the company additionally endeavored into non-VR hardware, such as the discontinued Meta Portal smart displays line and presently partners with Luxottica through the Ray-Ban Stories series of smart glasses.[22][23] Despite endeavors into hardware, the company still relies on advertising for a vast majority of its revenue, which in 2022 made up 97.5 percent of its revenue.[12]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2021, the parent company of Facebook changed its name from Facebook, Inc., to Meta Platforms, Inc., to \"reflect its focus on building the metaverse\".[24] According to Meta, the term \"metaverse\" refers to the integrated environment that links all of the company's products and services.[25][26][27]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Facebook and Initial public offering of Facebook\n\n![](image)Billboard on the Thomson Reuters building welcomes Facebook to Nasdaq, 2012\n![](image)Early chart of Facebook's stock\n![](image)Facebook corporate logo from 2019 to 2021\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series about |\n| Meta Platforms |\n| ![](image) |\n| * History\n\t+ Instagram\n\t+ WhatsApp\n* Acquisitions\n |\n| \nProducts and services |\n| Facebook\n* 2021 outage\n* Features\n\t+ Dating\n\t+ Feed\n\t+ Like button\n |\n| Other products\n* Instagram\n\t+ Threads\n* Messenger\n\t+ Kids\n* Meta AI\n* Meta Portal\n* Quest\n\t+ Quest 2\n\t+ Quest 3\n\t+ Supernatural\n* Ray-Ban Stories\n* WhatsApp\n |\n| \nPeople |\n| Executives and board members\n* Mark Zuckerberg\n* Sheryl Sandberg\n |\n| Notable employees\n* Adam Mosseri\n |\n| Related organizations\n* Oversight Board\n |\n| \nBusiness |\n| Criticism\n* Privacy concerns\n* Content management\n\t+ Censorship of\n\t+ Censorship by\n* Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n* 2020 ad boycotts\n* 2021 company files leak\n* WhatsApp security and privacy features\n* WhatsApp snooping scandal\n |\n| Litigation\n* *Young v.

IPO\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nFacebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on January 1, 2012.[28] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company sought to raise $5 billion, had 845 million monthly active users, and a website accruing 2.7 billion likes and comments daily.[29] After the IPO, Zuckerberg would retain a 22% ownership share in Facebook and would own 57% of the voting shares.[30]\n\n\nUnderwriters valued the shares at $38 each, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly public company.[31] On May 16, one day before the IPO, Facebook announced it would sell 25% more shares than originally planned due to high demand.[32] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third-largest in US history (slightly ahead of AT&T Wireless and behind only General Motors and Visa). The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations—surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, and Kraft Foods—and made Zuckerberg's stock worth $19 billion.[33][34] *The New York Times* stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook's difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a \"must-own stock\". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as \"the next great blue-chip\".[33] Writers at TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, \"That's a big multiple to live up to, and Facebook will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation.\"[35]\n\n\nTrading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the Nasdaq exchange.[36] The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.[37] At the closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[38] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.[39] The stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[40] On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[41]\n\n\nOn May 22, 2012, regulators from Wall Street's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients rather than the general public. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue.[42] The allegations sparked \"fury\" among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits, one of them a class action suit claiming more than $2.5 billion in losses due to the IPO.[43] Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook stock since its debut.[44] Standard & Poor's added Facebook to its S&P 500 index on December 21, 2013.[45]\n\n\nOn May 2, 2014, Zuckerberg announced that the company would be changing its internal motto from \"Move fast and break things\" to \"Move fast with stable infrastructure\".[46][47] The earlier motto had been described as Zuckerberg's \"prime directive to his developers and team\" in a 2009 interview in *Business Insider*, in which he also said, \"Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2020: Focus on the metaverse[edit]\n\n\nLasso was a short-video sharing app from Facebook similar to TikTok that was launched on iOS and Android in 2018 and was aimed at teenagers. On July 2, 2020, Facebook announced that Lasso would be shutting down on July 10.[49][50][51]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Oculus lead, Jason Rubin, sent his 50-page vision document titled \"The Metaverse\" to Facebook's leadership. In the document, Rubin acknowledged that Facebook's virtual reality business had not caught on as expected, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on content for early adopters. He also urged the company to execute fast and invest heavily in the vision, to shut out HTC, Apple, Google and other competitors in the VR space. Regarding other players' participation in the metaverse vision, he called for the company to build the \"metaverse\" to prevent their competitors from \"being in the VR business in a meaningful way at all\".[52]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Facebook founded Libra Networks, reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency.[53] Later, it was reported that Libra was being supported by financial companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber. The consortium of companies was expected to pool in $10 million each to fund the launch of the cryptocurrency coin named Libra.[54] Depending on when it would receive approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory authority to operate as a payments service, the Libra Association had planned to launch a limited format cryptocurrency in 2021.[55] Libra was renamed Diem, before being shut down and sold in January 2022 after backlash from government regulators and the public.[56][57]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of online services including Facebook grew globally.[58] Zuckerberg predicted this would be a \"permanent acceleration\" that would continue after the pandemic.[58] Facebook hired aggressively, growing from 48,268 employees in March 2020 to more than 87,000 by September 2022.[58]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Rebrand as Meta[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Criticism of Facebook, Instagram § Impact on people, 2021 Facebook leak, and Frances Haugen\nSee also: Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal and 2020 Facebook ad boycotts\n\nFollowing a period of intense scrutiny and damaging whistleblower leaks, news started to emerge on October 21, 2021, about Facebook's plan to rebrand the company and to change its name.[59][60] In the Q3 2021 Earnings Call, on October 25, Mark Zuckerberg discussed the ongoing criticism of the company's social services and the way it operates, and pointed to the pivoting efforts to building the metaverse – without mentioning the rebranding and the name change.[61] The metaverse vision and the name change from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms was introduced at Facebook Connect on October 28, 2021.[62] Based on Facebook's PR campaign, the name change reflects the company's shifting long term focus of building the metaverse, a digital extension of the physical world by social media, virtual reality and augmented reality features.[62][63]\n\n\n\"Meta\" had been registered as a trademark in the United States in 2018 (after an initial filing in 2015) for marketing, advertising, and computer services, by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis of scientific literature.[64] This company was acquired in 2017 by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a foundation established by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, and became one of their projects.[65] Following the rebranding announcement, CZI announced that it had already decided to deprioritize the earlier Meta project, that it would be transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms, and that the project would end in 2022.[66]\n\n\n\n### 2022–present: Declining profits and mass layoffs[edit]\n\n\nSoon after the rebranding, in early February 2022, Meta reported a greater-than-expected decline in profits in the fourth quarter of 2021.[67] It reported no growth in monthly users,[68] and indicated it expected revenue growth to stall.[67] It also expected measures taken by Apple, Inc. to protect user privacy to cost it some $10 billion in advertisement revenue, an amount equal to roughly 8% of its revenue for 2021.[69] In meeting with Meta staff the day after earnings were reported, Zuckerberg blamed competition for user attention, particularly from video-based apps such as TikTok.[70]\n\n\nThe 27% reduction in the company's share price which occurred in reaction to the news eliminated some $230 billion of value from Meta's market capitalization.[71] Bloomberg described the decline as \"an epic rout that, in its sheer scale, is unlike anything Wall Street or Silicon Valley has ever seen\".[71] Zuckerberg's net worth fell by as much as $31 billion.[72] Zuckerberg owns 13% of Meta, and the holding makes up the bulk of his wealth.[73][74]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg on March 30, 2022, Meta turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, a Meta representative said, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[75] In June 2022, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of 14 years, announced she would step down that year. Zuckerberg said that Javier Olivan would replace Sandberg, though in a \"more traditional\" role.[76]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Meta (except Meta-owned WhatsApp) and Instagram were banned in Russia and added to Russian list of terrorist and extremist organizations for alleged Russophobia amid ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.[77] Meta appealed against the ban but it was upheld by a Moscow court in June of the same year.[77]\n\n\nAlso in March 2022, Meta and Italian eyewear giant Luxottica released Ray-Ban Stories, a series of smartglasses which could play music and take pictures. Meta and Luxottica parent company EssilorLuxottica declined to disclose sales on the line of products as of September 2022, though Meta has expressed satisfaction with its customer feedback.[23][78][79]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Meta saw its first year-on-year revenue decline when its total revenue slipped by 1% to $28.8bn.[80] Analysts and journalists accredited the loss to its advertising business, which has been limited by Apple's app tracking transparency feature and the number of people who have opted not to be tracked by Meta apps. Zuckerberg also accredited the decline to increasing competition from TikTok.[81][82][83] On October 27, 2022, Meta's market value dropped to $268 billion, a loss of around $700 billion compared to 2021, and its shares fell by 24%. It lost its spot among the top 20 US companies by market cap, despite reaching the top 5 in the previous year.[84]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, 13% of its workforce. Zuckerberg said the decision to aggressively increase Meta's investments had been a mistake, as he had wrongly predicted that the surge in e-commerce would last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. He also attributed the decline to increased competition, a global economic downturn and \"ads signal loss\".[85] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in April 2023.[86] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[87][88]\n\n\nMeta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI.[89] On July 6, 2023, Meta launched a new app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[90]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the company announced it was making Llama 2, its artificial intelligence model, available for commercial use via partnerships with major cloud providers like Microsoft. This was the first project to be unveiled out of Meta's generative AI group after it was set up in February. It would not charge access or usage but instead operate with an open-source model to allow Meta to ascertain what improvements need to be made. Prior to this announcement, Meta said it had no plans to release Llama 2 for commercial use. An earlier version of Llama was released to academics.[91][92]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Meta announced its permanent removal of news content from Facebook and Instagram in Canada due to the *Online News Act*, which requires Canadian news outlets to be compensated for content shared on its platform. The Online News Act will be effective by year-end, but Meta will not participate in the regulatory process.[93]\n\n\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of mergers and acquisitions by Meta Platforms.\n\nMeta has acquired multiple companies (often identified as talent acquisitions).[94] One of its first major acquisitions was in April 2012, when it acquired Instagram for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.[95] In October 2013, Facebook, Inc. acquired Onavo, an Israeli mobile web analytics company.[96][97] In February 2014, Facebook, Inc. announced it would buy mobile messaging company WhatsApp for US$19 billion in cash and stock.[98][99] Later that year, Facebook bought Oculus VR for $2.3 billion in cash and stock,[100] which released its first consumer virtual reality headset in 2016. In late November 2019, Facebook, Inc. announced the acquisition of the game developer Beat Games, responsible for developing one of that year's most popular VR games, *Beat Saber*.[101] In Late 2022 after Facebook Inc rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc, Oculus was rebranded to Meta Quest.\n\n\nIn May 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced it had acquired Giphy for a reported cash price of $400 million. It will be integrated with the Instagram team.[102] However, in August 2021, UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated that Facebook, Inc. might have to sell Giphy, after an investigation found that the deal between the two companies would harm competition in display advertising market.[103] Facebook, Inc. was fined $70 million by CMA for deliberately failing to report all information regarding the acquisition and the ongoing antitrust investigation.[104] In October 2022, the CMA ruled for a second time that Meta be required to divest Giphy, stating that Meta already controls half of the advertising in the UK. Meta agreed to the sale, though it stated that it disagrees with the decision itself.[105] In May 2023, Giphy was divested to Shutterstock for $53 million.[106]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced that it planned to purchase the customer-service platform and chatbot specialist startup Kustomer to promote companies to use their platform for business. It has been reported that Kustomer valued at slightly over $1 billion.[107] The deal was closed in February 2022 after regulatory approval.[108]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Meta acquired Lofelt, a Berlin-based haptic tech startup.[109]\n\n\n\n## Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, Facebook, Inc. spent $19.7 million on lobbying, hiring 79 lobbyists. By 2019, it had spent $16.7 million on lobbying and had a team of 71 lobbyists, up from $12.6 million and 51 lobbyists in 2018.[110] Facebook was the largest spender of lobbying money among the Big Tech companies in 2020.[111] The lobbying team includes top congressional aide John Branscome, who was hired in September 2021, to help the company fend off threats from Democratic lawmakers and the Biden administration.[112]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lawsuits involving Meta Platforms\n\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed against the company, both when it was known as Facebook, Inc., and as Meta Platforms.\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) sued Facebook, for significant and persistent infringements of the rule on privacy involving the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. Every violation of the Privacy Act is subject to a theoretical cumulative liability of $1.7 million. The OAIC estimated that a total of 311,127 Australians had been exposed.[113]\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and 46 states (excluding Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and South Dakota), the District of Columbia and the territory of Guam, launched *Federal Trade Commission v. Facebook* as an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook. The lawsuit concerns Facebook's acquisition of two competitors—Instagram and WhatsApp—and the ensuing monopolistic situation. FTC alleges that Facebook holds monopolistic power in the US social networking market and seeks to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp to break up the conglomerate.[114] William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued the case will be difficult to win as it would require the government to create a counterfactual argument of an internet where the Facebook-WhatsApp-Instagram entity did not exist, and prove that harmed competition or consumers.[115]\n\n\nOn December 24, 2021, a court in Russia fined Meta for $27 million after the company declined to remove unspecified banned content. The fine was reportedly tied to the company's annual revenue in the country.[116]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Kenya against Meta and its local outsourcing company Sama. Allegedly, Meta has poor working conditions in Kenya for workers moderating Facebook posts. According to the lawsuit, 260 screeners were declared redundant with confusing reasoning. The lawsuit seeks financial compensation and an order that outsourced moderators be given the same health benefits and pay scale as Meta employees.[117][118]\n\n\nIn June 2022, 8 lawsuits were filed across the US over the allege that excessive exposure to platforms including Facebook and Instagram has led to attempted or actual suicides, eating disorders and sleeplessness, among other issues. The litigation follows a former Facebook employee's testimony in Congress that the company refused to take responsibility. The company noted that tools have been developed for parents to keep track of their children's activity on Instagram and set time limits in addition to Meta's \"Take a break\" reminders. In addition, the company is providing resources specific to eating disorders as well as developing AI to prevent children under the age of 13 signing up for Facebook or Instagram.[119]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Meta settled a lawsuit with the US Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019, alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through targeted advertising, as it allowed home owners and landlords to run housing ads excluding people based on sex, race, religion, and other characteristics. The US Department of Justice stated that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Meta was handed a penalty of $115,054 and given until December 31, 2022, to shadow the algorithm tool.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Meta was fined €390 million for violations of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.[123]\n\n\nIn May 2023, the European Data Protection Board fined Meta a record €1.2 billion for breaching European Union data privacy laws by transferring personal data of Facebook users to servers in the U.S.[124]\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Meta, in 2012\n### Management[edit]\n\n\nMeta's key management consists of:[125][126]\n\n\n\n* Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and chief executive officer\n* Javier Olivan, chief operating officer\n* Sir Nick Clegg, president, global affairs\n* Susan Li, chief financial officer\n* Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer\n* David Wehner, chief strategy officer\n* Chris Cox, chief product officer\n* Jennifer Newstead, chief legal officer\n\n\nAs of October 2022[update], Meta had 83,553 employees worldwide.\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 2023, Meta's board consisted of the following directors;[127]\n\n\n\n* Mark Zuckerberg (chairman, co-founder, controlling shareholder, and chief executive officer)\n* Sheryl Sandberg (non-executive director and former chief operating officer)\n* Peggy Alford (non-executive director, executive vice president, global sales, PayPal)\n* Marc Andreessen (non-executive director, co-founder and general partner, Andreessen Horowitz)\n* Drew Houston (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, Dropbox)\n* Nancy Killefer (non-executive director, senior partner, McKinsey & Company)\n* Robert M. Kimmitt (non-executive director, senior international counsel, WilmerHale)\n* Tracey Travis (non-executive director, executive vice president, chief financial officer, Estée Lauder Companies)\n* Tony Xu (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, DoorDash)\n\n\n### Company governance[edit]\n\n\nEarly Facebook investor and Zuckerberg's former mentor, Roger McNamee described Facebook as having \"the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company.\"[128] Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder argued for transforming Facebook into a platform cooperative owned and governed by the users.[129]\n\n\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes has stated that chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, that the company is now a monopoly, and that, as a result, it should be split into multiple smaller companies. In an op-ed in *The New York Times*, Hughes said he was concerned that Zuckerberg had surrounded himself with a team that did not challenge him, and that it is the U.S. government's job to hold him accountable and curb his \"unchecked power\".[130] He also said that \"Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American.\"[131] Several U.S. politicians agreed with Hughes.[132] European Union Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager stated that splitting Facebook should be done only as \"a remedy of the very last resort\", and that it would not solve Facebook's underlying problems.[133]\n\n\n\n## Revenue[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRevenue  \n(in millions USD)\n| Year | Revenue | Growth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | $0.4[134] | —\n |\n| 2005 | $9[134] | 2150%\n |\n| 2006 | $48[134] | 433%\n |\n| 2007 | $153[134] | 219%\n |\n| 2008 | $280[135] | 83%\n |\n| 2009 | $775[136] | 177%\n |\n| 2010 | $2,000[137] | 158%\n |\n| 2011 | $3,711[138] | 86%\n |\n| 2012 | $5,089[139] | 37%\n |\n| 2013 | $7,872[139] | 55%\n |\n| 2014 | $12,466[140] | 58%\n |\n| 2015 | $17,928[141] | 44%\n |\n| 2016 | $27,638[142] | 54%\n |\n| 2017 | $40,653[143] | 47%\n |\n| 2018 | $55,838[144] | 37%\n |\n| 2019 | $70,697[144] | 27%\n |\n| 2020 | $85,965[145] | 22%\n |\n| 2021 | $117,929[146] | 37%\n |\n| 2022 | $116,609[13] | -1%\n |\n\n\nFacebook ranked No. 34 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue, with almost $86 billion in revenue[147] most of it coming from advertising.[148][149] One analysis of 2017 data determined that the company earned US$20.21 per user from advertising.[150]\n\n\nAccording to *New York*, since its rebranding, Meta has reportedly lost $500 billion as a result of new privacy measures put in place by companies such as Apple and Google which prevents Meta from gathering users' data.[151][152]\n\n\n\n### Number of advertisers[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Facebook announced it had reached two million active advertisers, with most of the gain coming from small businesses. An active advertiser was defined as an entity that had advertised on the Facebook platform in the last 28 days.[153] In March 2016, Facebook announced it had reached three million active advertisers with more than 70% from outside the United States.[154] Prices for advertising follow a variable pricing model based on auctioning ad placements, and potential engagement levels of the advertisement itself. Similar to other online advertising platforms like Google and Twitter, targeting of advertisements is one of the chief merits of digital advertising compared to traditional media. Marketing on Meta is employed through two methods based on the viewing habits, likes and shares, and purchasing data of the audience, namely targeted audiences and \"look alike\" audiences.[155]\n\n\n\n### Tax affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes, and Double Irish arrangement § Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\nThe US IRS challenged the valuation Facebook used when it transferred IP from the US to Facebook Ireland (now Meta Platforms Ireland) in 2010 (which Facebook Ireland then revalued higher before charging out), as it was building its double Irish tax structure.[156][157] The case is ongoing and Meta faces a potential fine of $3–5bn.[158]\n\n\nThe US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed Facebook's global tax calculations. Meta Platforms Ireland is subject to the US GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if its Irish business relocated to the US. Tax relief in the US (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective US rate around 12%.[159][160][161]\n\n\nThe insignificance of the US/Irish tax difference was demonstrated when Facebook moved 1.5bn non-EU accounts to the US to limit exposure to GDPR.[162][163]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nUsers outside of the US and Canada contract with Meta's Irish subsidiary, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly *Facebook Ireland Limited*), allowing Meta to avoid US taxes for all users in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. Meta is making use of the Double Irish arrangement which allows it to pay 2–3% corporation tax on all international revenue.[164] In 2010, Facebook opened its fourth office, in Hyderabad, India,[165] which houses online advertising and developer support teams and provides support to users and advertisers.[166] In India, Meta is registered as Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd.[167] It also has support centers in Chittagong; Dublin;[*clarification needed*] California; Ireland; and Austin, Texas.[168][*not specific enough to verify*]\n\n\nFacebook opened its London headquarters in 2017 in Fitzrovia in central London. Facebook opened an office in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2018. The offices were initially home to the \"Connectivity Lab\", a group focused on bringing Internet access to those who do not have access to the Internet.[169] In April 2019, Facebook opened its Taiwan headquarters in Taipei.[170]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Meta opened new regional headquarters in Dubai.[171]\n\n\nIn September 2023, it was reported that Meta had paid £149m to British Land in order to break the lease on Triton Square London office. Meta reportedly had another 18 years left on its lease on the site. [172]\n\n\n\n* ![Entrance to Meta's headquarters complex in Menlo Park, California](image)\n\nEntrance to Meta's headquarters complex in Menlo Park, California\n\n\n* ![Entrance to Facebook's previous headquarters in the Stanford Research Park, Palo Alto, California](image)\n\nEntrance to Facebook's previous headquarters in the Stanford Research Park, Palo Alto, California\n\n\n* ![Inside the Facebook headquarters in 2014](image)\n\nInside the Facebook headquarters in 2014\n\n\n\n### Data centers[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Facebook operated 21 data centers.[173] It committed to purchase 100% renewable energy and to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 75% by 2020.[174] Its data center technologies include Fabric Aggregator, a distributed network system that accommodates larger regions and varied traffic patterns.[175]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Criticism of Facebook, Privacy concerns with Facebook, and Censorship by Facebook\n\nUS Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet to Zuckerberg's announcement about Meta, saying: \"Meta as in 'we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society ... for profit!'\"[176]\n\n\nEx-Facebook employee Frances Haugen and whistleblower behind the Facebook Papers responded to the rebranding efforts by expressing doubts about the company's ability to improve while led by Mark Zuckerberg, and urged the chief executive officer to resign.[177]\n\n\nIn November 2021, a video published by Inspired by Iceland went viral, in which a Zuckerberg look-alike promoted the Icelandverse, a place of \"enhanced actual reality without silly looking headsets\".[178]\n\n\nIn a December 2021 interview, SpaceX and Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk said he could not see a compelling use-case for the VR-driven metaverse, adding: \"I don't see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day.\"[179]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Louise Eccles of *The Sunday Times* logged into the metaverse with the intention of making a video guide. She wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Initially, my experience with the Oculus went well. I attended work meetings as an avatar and tried an exercise class set in the streets of Paris. The headset enabled me to feel the thrill of carving down mountains on a snowboard and the adrenaline rush of climbing a mountain without ropes. Yet switching to the social apps, where you mingle with strangers also using VR headsets, it was at times predatory and vile.\n> \n> \n\n\nEccles described being sexually harassed by another user, as well as \"accents from all over the world, American, Indian, English, Australian, using racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic language\". She also encountered users as young as 7 years old on the platform, despite Oculus headsets being intended for users over 13.[180]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Big Tech\n* Criticism of Facebook\n* Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n* 2021 Facebook leak\n* Meta AI\n* *The Social Network*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Madrigal, Alexis C.

It allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.[11]\n\n\nInstagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people daily.[11]\n\n\n\nOriginally launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion by June 2018. In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015[update], over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Instagram.\n\n![](image)Instagram icon from 2016 to 2022, when it was updated to include even more saturated colors\nInstagram began development in San Francisco as **Burbn**, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $682,200 in 2023) seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[12][13] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users.[14][15] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.[16]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding[edit]\n\n\nJosh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[17] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[17] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[17][18]\n\n\nThe first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 p.m. on July 16, 2010.[19][15] Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later at 9:24 p.m. It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its URL.[20][21][*better source needed*] On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store. In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million (equivalent to $9,357,057 in 2023) in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[22] The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million. In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million (equivalent to $65,610,000 in 2023) from venture capitalists with a valuation of $500 million (equivalent to $656,100,000 in 2023).[23] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.[24]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook[edit]\n\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones,[25][26] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.[27] The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements;[28][29] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were \"exploring an iOS version\".On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram for $1 billion (equivalent to $1,312,000,000 in 2023) in cash and stock ,[30][31][32] with a plan to keep the company independently managed.[33][34][35] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,[36] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.[37] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[38]\n\n\nThe deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN.[35] The deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[35] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was \"committed to building and growing Instagram independently.\"[35] According to *Wired*, the deal netted Systrom $400 million.[39]\n\n\nIn November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with limited functionality,[40] as well as a selection of *badges*, and web widget buttons to link to profiles.[41]\n\n\nSince the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.[42][43]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Instagram headquarters in Menlo Park\nIn June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website.[44][45][46] Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The *slideshow banner*[47][48] on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed. In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.\n\n\nIn April 2016, Instagram released a Windows 10 Mobile app, after years of demand from Microsoft and the public to release an app for the platform.[49][50] The platform previously had a beta version of Instagram, first released on November 21, 2013, for Windows Phone 8.[51][52][53] The new app added support for videos (viewing and creating posts or stories, and viewing live streams), album posts and direct messages.[54] Similarly, an app for Windows 10 personal computers and tablets was released in October 2016.[55][56] In May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a \"lightweight\" version of the Explore tab.[57][58]\n\n\nOn May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white flat design theme for the app's user interface, and a less skeuomorphistic, more abstract, \"modern\" and colorful icon.[59][60][61] Rumors of a redesign first started circulating in April, when *The Verge* received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that it was only a concept.[62]\n\n\nOn December 6, 2016, Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the user who posted a comment does not receive notifications about comment likes in their notification inbox. Uploaders can optionally decide to deactivate comments on a post.[63][64][65]\n\n\nThe mobile website allows uploading pictures since May 4, 2017. Image filters and the ability to upload videos were not introduced then.[66][67]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2019, the Windows 10 Mobile app was discontinued, though the mobile website remains available as a progressive web application (PWA) with limited functionality. The app remains available on Windows 10 computers and tablets, also updated to a PWA in 2020.\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: IGTV, removal of the like counter, management changes[edit]\n\n\nTo comply with the GDPR regulations regarding data portability, Instagram introduced the ability for users to download an archive of their user data in April 2018.[68][69][70]\n\n\nIGTV launched on June 20, 2018, as a standalone video application. The application was shut down and removed from app stores in March 2022, citing low usage and a shift to short-form video content.[71]\n\n\nOn September 24, 2018, Krieger and Systrom announced in a statement they would be stepping down from Instagram.[72][73] On October 1, 2018, it was announced that Adam Mosseri would be the new head of Instagram.[74][75][76]\n\n\nDuring Facebook F8, it was announced that Instagram would, beginning in Canada, pilot the removal of publicly displayed \"like\" counts for content posted by other users.[77] Like counts would only be visible to the user who originally posted the content. Mosseri stated that this was intended to have users \"worry a little bit less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care about.\"[78][79] It has been argued that low numbers of likes in relativity to others could contribute to a lower self-esteem in users.[79][77] The pilot began in May 2019, and was extended to 6 other markets in July.[79][80] The pilot was expanded worldwide in November 2019.[81] Also in July 2019, Instagram announced that it would implement new features designed to reduce harassment and negative comments on the service.[82]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal of the \"Following\" tab from the app, which had allowed users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was made official in October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that the feature was underused and that some users were \"surprised\" when they realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner.[83][84]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Instagram introduced a limit on the number of posts visible in page scrolling mode unless logged in. Until this point, public profiles had been available to all users, even when not logged in. Following the change, after viewing a number of posts a pop-up requires the user to log in to continue viewing content.[85][86][87]\n\n\nThat month, Instagram launched a separate app known as Threads. Similar to Snapchat, the app allowed users to communicate through messaging and video chats.[88] It was integrated with Instagram's \"Close friends\" feature, so that users could send images, photos, and texts privately to others, and also had Instagram's photo editing system embedded into the app.[89][90] However, Instagram discontinued this version of Threads in December 2021,[91] mainly due to most of its features being rolled out on Instagram itself, as well as low usage compared to other social media applications.[92] Threads was not well-received among Instagram's user base. Since its launch, only approximately 220,000 users globally downloaded the app, which represented less than 0.1% of Instagram's monthly active users, indicating a lack of success in driving adoption.[93]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: New features[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called \"Co-Watching\". The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[94]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Instagram began a pivot to video, introducing a new feature called \"Reels\".[95][96][97] The intent was to compete with the video-sharing site TikTok.[97][98][95] Instagram also added suggested posts in August 2020. After scrolling through posts from the past 48 hours, Instagram displays posts related to their interests from accounts they do not follow.[99]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Instagram began testing a new feature called Vertical Stories, said by some sources to be inspired by TikTok.[100] The same month, they also began testing the removal of ability to share feed posts to stories.[101]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Instagram launched a new feature in which four people can go live at once.[102] Instagram also announced that adults would not be allowed to message teens who don't follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.[103][104][105][106]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Instagram began allowing users in some regions to add pronouns to their profile page.[107][108]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2021, Meta services suffered their worst outage since 2008, bringing down Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.[109][110] Security experts identified the problem as possibly being DNS-related.[111]\n\n\nOn March 17, 2022, Zuckerberg confirmed plans to add non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the platform. In September 2022, Ireland's Data Protection Commission fined the company $402 million under privacy laws recently adopted by the European Union over how it handled the privacy data of minors.[112][113][114]\n\n\nAfter being trialled in mid-2022,[115] Instagram introduced Notes in December 2022. This feature allows users to share updates as short text posts of up to 60 characters with certain people, who can then reply to them using messaging on Instagram.[116][117]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Instagram introduced a new feature allowing users to browse and post GIFs in their comments.[118] That same month, Zuckerberg announced that Meta would start selling blue \"verified\" badges on Instagram and Facebook.[119]\n\n\nOn July 5, 2023, Meta launched Threads, a social network platform connected to Instagram that allows users to make public shortform blog posts comprising text, photos, and videos, as well as to converse with other users and reblog other users' posts. Threads aims to compete with Twitter.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Instagram began testing the removal of the ability to see \"recent\" posts from various hashtags.[123] This change became permanent and system wide a year later, and now hashtags can only be used to see a selection of curated content from \"top\" users.[124] These changes are ostensibly an attempt to hinder the spread of misinformation, while Instagram has also repeatedly stated that hashtags do not help posts get views.[125]\n\n\n\n## Features and tools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An original photograph (left) is automatically cropped to a square by Instagram, and has a filter added at the selection of the user (right).\n![](image)A photo collage of an unprocessed image (top left) modified with the 16 different Instagram filters available in 2011\nUsers can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds,[126] and geotag images with the name of a location.[127] Users can set their account as \"private\", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests.[128] Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites.[129] In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt–shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon.[130][131] Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well.[132][133][134] Users could formerly view a map of a user's geotagged photos. The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage.[135][136]\n\n\nSince December 2016, posts can be \"saved\" into a private area of the app.[137][138] The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into named collections.[139][140] Users can also \"archive\" their posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of \"likes\" or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the \"emergent behavior\" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content.[141][142] In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily interact with replies.[143][144]\n\n\nSince February 2017, up to ten pictures or videos can be included in a single post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel.[145][146] The feature originally limited photos to the square format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead.[147][148]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called \"focus mode,\" which gently blurs the background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected.[149] In November, Instagram began to support Alt text to add descriptions of photos for the visually impaired. They are either generated automatically using object recognition (using existing Facebook technology) or manually specified by the uploader.[150]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2021, Instagram launched a new feature named Instagram Live \"Rooms\" Let Four People Go Live Together.[151]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Instagram announced a new accessibility feature for videos on Instagram Reels and Stories to allow creators to place closed captions on their content.[152]\n\n\n\n### Hashtags[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other.[153][154] Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like \"photo\", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users.[155]\n\n\nUsers on Instagram have created \"trends\" through hashtags. The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on. Examples of popular trends include #SelfieSunday, in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays; #MotivationMonday, in which users post motivational photos on Mondays; #TransformationTuesday, in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present; #WomanCrushWednesday, in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably, as well as its #ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men; and #ThrowbackThursday, in which users post a photo from their past, highlighting a particular moment.[156][157]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Instagram began to allow users to follow hashtags, which display relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds.[158][159] The ability to search \"Recent\" hashtags was temporarily disabled during the 2020 US elections, to prevent the spread of misinformation.[160] In 2022 this was again tested on some users, and in April 2023 the ability to search recent hashtags was removed entirely. Now, users are only able to see a curated selection of \"popular\" posts using a given hashtag. Instagram states that this is to prevent abuse and that hashtags do not help users gain views, but it has been noted that using hashtags is the only free method for a user to reach past their existing followers.[161]\n\n\n\n### Explore[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Instagram introduced \"Explore\", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search.[162] The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations.[163] In April 2016, Instagram added a \"Videos You Might Like\" channel to the tab,[164][165] followed by an \"Events\" channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events,[166][167] followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October.[168][169] The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically curated page of the \"best\" Instagram Live videos currently airing.[170] In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places.[171]\n\n\n\n### Photographic filters[edit]\n\n\nInstagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images. In February 2012, Instagram added a \"Lux\" filter, an effect that \"lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast\".[172][173] In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters to be added to the Instagram filter family.[174]\n\n\n\n### Video[edit]\n\n\nInitially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013.[175][176] The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine.[177][178] In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos.[179][180] In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to 60 seconds.[181][182] Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post.[145][146][183]\n\n\n\n#### IGTV[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IGTV\n\nIGTV is a vertical video application launched by Instagram[184] in June 2018. Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website. IGTV allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650 MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to 60 minutes in length with a file size of up to 5.4 GB.[185] The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched, which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video.[186][187][188] In March 2022, the application was shut down.[71]\n\n\n\n#### Reels[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2019, it was reported that Instagram had begun to pilot a new video feature known as \"Reels\" in Brazil, expanding to France and Germany afterwards.[189] It is similar in functionality to the Chinese video-sharing service TikTok, with a focus on allowing users to record short videos set to pre-existing sound clips from other posts.[190] Users could make up to 15 (later 30) second videos using this feature.[191] Reels also integrates with existing Instagram filters and editing tools.[185]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Instagram rolled out Reels to India after TikTok was banned in the country.[192] The following month, Reels officially launched in 50 countries including the United States, Canada and United Kingdom.[193] Instagram has recently introduced a reel button on home page.[194]\n\n\nOn June 17, 2021, Instagram launched full-screen advertisements in Reels. The ads are similar to regular reels and can run up to 30 seconds. They are distinguished from regular content by the \"sponsored\" tag under the account name.[195]\n\n\nDespite the \"TikTokification\" of Reels and the parent company Meta spending millions on courting content creators, user engagement continued to lag far behind TikTok as of 2022.[196]\n\n\n\n### Instagram Direct[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging. Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people.[197][198][199] The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed. Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon. A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation.[200][201][202] A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages \"disappear\" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot.[203][204]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages, both permanent and ephemeral, into the same message threads.[205][206][207] In May, Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages, and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping.[208][209]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Direct became accessible from the Instagram website, allowing users to send direct messages from a web version using WebSocket technology.[210]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Facebook started merging Instagram Direct into Facebook Messenger. After the update (which is rolled out to a segment of the user base) the Instagram Direct icon transforms into Facebook Messenger icon.[211]\n\n\nIn March 2021, a feature was added that prevents adults from messaging users under 18 who do not follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### Instagram Stories[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature's similarities to Snapchat.[212][213] In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told *Recode* that \"Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter [and] some stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology\". Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as \"fair\", *Recode* wrote that \"he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences\". Systrom further stated that \"When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind. We did all that, we implemented that.\" He also told the publication that Snapchat \"didn't have filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.\"[214][215]\n\n\nIn November, Instagram added live video functionality to Instagram Stories, allowing users to broadcast themselves live, with the video disappearing immediately after ending.[216][170]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Instagram launched skippable ads, where five-second photo and 15-second video ads appear in-between different stories.[217][218][219]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers, a \"clone\" of Snapchat's functionality.[220][221][219]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters, letting users add specific visual features onto their faces.[222][223]\n\n\nLater in May, *TechCrunch* reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories, where public Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business, landmark or place's Instagram page.[224] A few days later, Instagram announced \"Story Search\", in which users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term.[171][225]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Instagram revised its live-video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next 24 hours, or discard the broadcast immediately.[226] In July, Instagram started allowing users to respond to Stories content by sending photos and videos, complete with Instagram effects such as filters, stickers, and hashtags.[227][228]\n\n\nStories were made available for viewing on Instagram's mobile and desktop websites in late August 2017.[229][230]\n\n\nOn December 5, 2017, Instagram introduced \"Story Highlights\",[231] also known as \"Permanent Stories\", which are similar to Instagram Stories, but don't expire. They appear as circles below the profile picture and biography and are accessible from the desktop website as well.\n\n\nIn June 2018, the daily active story users of Instagram had reached 400 million users, and monthly active users had reached 1 billion active users.[232]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\nEmily White joined Instagram as Director of Business Operations in April 2013.[233][234] She stated in an interview with *The Wall Street Journal* in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company.[235] White left Instagram in December 2013 to join Snapchat.[236][237] In August 2014, James Quarles became Instagram's Global Head of Business and Brand Development, tasked with overseeing advertisement, sales efforts, and developing new \"monetization products\", according to a spokesperson.[238]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Instagram announced that video and image ads would soon appear in feeds for users in the United States,[239][240] with the first image advertisements displaying on November 1, 2013.[241][242] Video ads followed nearly a year later on October 30, 2014.[243][244] In June 2014, Instagram announced the rollout of ads in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia,[245] with ads starting to roll out that autumn.[246]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Instagram announced it would implement \"carousel ads,\" allowing advertisers to display multiple images with options for linking to additional content.[247][248] The company launched carousel image ads in October 2015,[249][250] and video carousel ads in March 2016.[251]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Instagram announced that it had 200,000 advertisers on the platform.[252] This number increased to 500,000 by September 2016,[253] and 1 million in March 2017.[254][255]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Instagram launched new tools for business accounts, including business profiles, analytics and the ability to promote posts as ads. To access the tools, businesses had to link a corresponding Facebook page.[256] The new analytics page, known as Instagram Insights, allowed business accounts to view top posts, reach, impressions, engagement and demographic data.[256] Insights rolled out first in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, and expanded to the rest of the world later in 2016.[257][256][258]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Instagram added the ability for business accounts to add product links directing users to a purchase page or to save them to a \"shopping list.\"[259] In April 2019, Instagram added the option to \"Checkout on Instagram,\" which allows merchants to sell products directly through the Instagram app.[260]\n\n\nIn March 2020, via a blog post, Instagram announced that they are making major moderation changes in order to decrease the flow of disinformation, hoaxes and fake news regarding COVID-19 on its platform, \"We'll remove COVID-19 accounts from account recommendations, and we are working to remove some COVID-19 related content from Explore unless posted by a credible health organization. We will also start to downrank content in feed and Stories that has been rated false by third-party fact-checkers.\"[261]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Instagram launched a native affiliate marketing tool creators can use to earn commissions based on sales. Commission-enabled posts are labeled \"Eligible for Commission\" on the user side to identify them as affiliate posts. Launch partners included Sephora, MAC, and Kopari.[262]\n\n\n\n### Stand-alone apps[edit]\n\n\nInstagram has developed and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality. In July 2014, it released **Bolt**, a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen.[263][264] It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August, an iOS-exclusive app that uses \"clever algorithm processing\" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos.[265][266] Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May 2015, but there has been no official Hyperlapse app from Instagram for either of these platforms to date.[267] In October 2015, it released **Boomerang**, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop.[268][269]\n\n\n\n### Third-party services[edit]\n\n\nThe popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third-party services designed to integrate with it, including services for creating content to post on the service and generating content from Instagram photos (including physical print-outs), analytics, and alternative clients for platforms with insufficient or no official support from Instagram (such as in the past, iPads).[270][271]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Instagram announced that effective June 1, 2016, it would end \"feed\" API access to its platform in order to \"maintain control for the community and provide a clear roadmap for developers\" and \"set up a more sustainable environment built around authentic experiences on the platform\", including those oriented towards content creation, publishers, and advertisers. Additionally, third-party clients have been prohibited from using the text strings \"insta\" or \"gram\" in their name.[272] It was reported that these changes were primarily intended to discourage third-party clients replicating the entire Instagram experience (due to increasing monetization of the service), and security reasons (such as preventing abuse by automated click farms, and the hijacking of accounts). In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Instagram began to impose further restrictions on its API in 2018.[271][273][274]\n\n\nFor unlimited browsing of public Instagram profiles without having to create an account, as well as for anonymous browsing of someone else's Stories, has to use the Instagram profiles viewer.[275] Stories are more authentic than typical photos posted as posts because users know that in 24 hours their Stories will disappear if they don't add them as highlighted[276] (however users can check who saw their Story for 48 hours after it was published[277]). For this reason, they are very valuable for market research.[278]\n\n\n\n### Fact checking[edit]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2019, Facebook announced it would expand its fact checking programs towards Instagram,[279] by using third-party fact-checkers organizations false information is able to be identified, reviewed and labeled as false information. Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages, additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such. With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation. If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false.[280]\n\n\n\n### Algorithm and design changes[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user's timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm.[281] Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked,[282] but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates.[283][284][285] The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down,[286] nor provide a way to change it back, which they re-affirmed in 2020.[287][288] However, in December 2021, Adam Mosseri, in a Senate hearing on child safety issues, stated that the company is developing a version of the feed that would show user posts in chronological order.[289] He later clarified the company would introduce two modes: a classic chronological feed and a version of it that would let users pick \"favorite\" users whose posts would be shown at the top in chronological order while other posts would be mixed in below.[290]\n\n\nSince 2017, Instagram has employed the ability to reduce the prominence of accounts (\"shadowbanning\") it believes may be generating non-genuine engagement and spam (including excessive use of unneeded hashtags), preventing posts from appearing in search results and in the app's Explore section. In a now-deleted Facebook post, Instagram wrote that \"When developing content, we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags\".[291][292] Instagram has since been accused of extending the practice to censor posts under vague and inconsistent circumstances, particularly in regards to sexually suggestive material.[293]\n\n\nInstagram caused the userbase to fall into outrage with the December 2018 update.[294][295][296][297][298][*excessive citations*] They found an attempt to alter the flow of the feed from the traditional vertical scroll to emulate and piggy-back the popularity of their Instagram Stories with a horizontal scroll, by swiping left.[299] Various backtracking statements were released explaining it as a bug, or as a test release that had been accidentally deployed to too large an audience.[297][296]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Instagram replaced the activity feed tab with a new \"Shop\" tab, moving the activity feed to the top. The \"new post\" button was also relocated to the top and replaced with a Reels tab[300] The company states that \"the Shop tab gives you a better way to connect with brands and creators and discover products you love\" and the Reels tab \"makes it easier for you to discover short, fun videos from creators all over the world and people just like you.\"[301] However, users have not responded well to the change, taking their complaints to Twitter and Reddit, and *The New York Times* has shunned Reels in particular, saying \"Not only does Reels fail in every way as a TikTok clone, but it’s confusing, frustrating and impossible to navigate\".[302]\n\n\nAlso in 2020, Instagram rolled out a feature titled \"suggested posts\", which adds posts from accounts Instagram thinks a user would like to such user's feed.[303] The feature was met with controversy from both Reddit users[304] from *The Verge*, which reported that suggested posts would keep users glued to their feed, give Instagram more advertising space, and ultimately harm the mental health of users, while Instagram executive Julian Gutman rebutted, stating the feature was not intended to keep users glued to their screens.[305] Suggested posts received more controversy after Fast Company stated that the feature would be impossible to turn off.[306]\n\n\nOn June 23, 2021, Instagram announced a test change to the \"suggested posts\" feature. The company will put suggested posts ahead of posts from people who the user is following in the Instagram feed, citing positive reception as the reason for this change.[307]\n\n\n\n## Scientific studies[edit]\n\n\n### Harmful effect on teenage girls' mental health[edit]\n\n\nFacebook has known for years that its Instagram app is harmful to a large number of teenagers, according to research seen by *The Wall Street Journal*, but the company concealed the knowledge from lawmakers.[308] The internal Facebook presentations seen by the *Journal* in 2021 show that Instagram is toxic to a sizable percentage of its users, particularly teenage girls. More than 40% of Instagram's users are under 23 years old. The presentations were seen by the company's executives and the findings mentioned to Mark Zuckerberg in 2020, but when asked in March 2021 about Instagram's effect on young people, Zuckerberg defended the company's plan to launch an Instagram product for children under 13.[308] When asked by senators for its internal findings on the impact of Instagram on youth mental health, Facebook sent a six-page letter that did not include the company's research. The company told Forbes that its research is \"kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.\"[309] In a blog post, Instagram said that the WSJ story \"focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light.\"[310] On September 27, 2021, weeks after the WSJ report was released, Facebook announced that it had \"paused\" development of Instagram Kids, the Instagram product aimed at children. The company stated it was looking into concerns raised by the regulators and parents. Adam Mosseri stated that the company would return to the project as \"[t]he reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today.\"[311][312] Based on Facebook's leaked internal research, Instagram has had negative effects on the body image of one in three teenagers.[313] Leaked internal documents also indicate that two thirds of teen girls and 40 percent of teen boys experience negative social comparison, and that Instagram makes 20 percent of the teens feel worse about themselves. According to the leaked research, Instagram has higher impact on appearance comparison than TikTok or Snapchat.[314] 13 percent of British, and 6 percent of US, teenager users with suicidal thoughts could trace them to Instagram use.[313]\n\n\n\n### Depression, anxiety and stress[edit]\n\n\nKhodarahimi and Fathi found evidence that Instagram users displayed higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms compared to non-users.[315] However, Frison & Eggermont 2017 found that, among both boys and girls, browsing could predict the presence of depressive symptoms; liking and posting seemed to have no effect.[316] In addition, their study showed that the presence of depressive symptoms in a given user could positively predict that they would make posts.[316] The study showed that the viewing of celebrity and peer pictures could make the moods of women more negative.[316][317] In a 2021 study, Mun & Kim pointed out that Instagram users with a strong need for approval were more likely to falsely present themselves on their Instagram accounts, which in turn increased the likelihood of depression. However, depression was mitigated by the users' perception of their own popularity.[318]\n\n\nLub & Trub 2015 showed that following more strangers increases social comparisons and depressive symptoms.[319] Multiple studies have found that increasing time spent on Instagram increases social anxiety and anxiety related to personal traits, physical appearance, and high-stress body areas in particular.[320][321][322] Sherlock & Wagstaff 2019 showed that both the number of followers and followees can slightly increase anxiety over personal traits.[323] Additionally, Moujaes & Verrier 2020 observed a connection between online engagement with mothering-based influencers known as InstaMums and anxiety.[324] However, Mackson et al. 2019 suggested beneficial effects of Instagram use on anxiety symptoms.[325][324]\n\n\n\n### Body image[edit]\n\n\nInstagram users report higher body surveillance (the habitual monitoring of one's body shape and size),[326] appearance-related pressure,[327] eating-disorder-related-pathology[328] and lower body satisfaction[328] than non-users. Multiple studies have also shown that users who take more selfies before making a post, and those who strategically present themselves by participating in such activities as editing or manipulating selfies, report higher levels of body surveillance and body dissatisfaction, and lower body esteem overall.[329][330][331][332] Tiggermann et al. showed that facial satisfaction can decrease when one spends greater time editing selfies for Instagram. Comments related to appearance on Instagram can lead to higher dissatisfaction with one's body.[333][334][335][336]\n\n\n\n### Loneliness and social exclusion[edit]\n\n\nMackson et al. 2019 found that Instagram users were less lonely than non-users[325] and that Instagram membership predicts lower self-reported loneliness.[332] A 2021 study by Büttner & Rudertb also showed that not being tagged in an Instagram photo triggers the feeling of social exclusion and ostracism, especially for those with higher needs to belong.[337] However, Brailovskaia & Margraf 2018 found a significant positive relationship between Instagram membership and extraversion, life satisfaction, and social support. Their study showed only a marginally significant negative association between Instagram membership and self-conscientiousness.[338] Fioravanti et al. 2020 showed that women who had to take a break from Instagram for seven days reported higher life satisfaction compared to women who continued their habitual pattern of Instagram use. The effects seemed to be specific for women, where no significant differences were observed for men.[339] The relationship between Instagram use and the fear of missing out, or FOMO, has been confirmed in multiple studies.[340][341] Research shows that Instagram browsing predicts social comparison, which generates FOMO, which can ultimately lead to depression.[342]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol and drug use[edit]\n\n\nThere is a small positive correlation between the intensity of one's Instagram usage and alcohol consumption, with binge drinkers reporting greater intensity of Instagram use than non-binge drinkers.[343] Boyle et al. 2016 found a small to moderate positive relationship between alcohol consumption, enhanced drinking motives, and drinking behavior during college and Instagram usage,[344]\n\n\n\n### Eating disorders[edit]\n\n\nA comparison of Instagram users with non-users showed that boys with an Instagram account differ from boys without an account in terms of over-evaluation of their shape and weight, skipping meals, and levels of reported disordered eating cognitions. Girls with an Instagram account only differed from girls without an account in terms of skipping meals; they also had a stricter exercise schedule, a pattern not found in boys. This suggests a possible negative effect of Instagram usage on body satisfaction and disordered eating for both boys and girls.[332][345] Several studies identified a small positive relationship between time spent on Instagram and both internalization of beauty or muscular ideals and self-objectification.[332][346][347][348] Both Appel et al. 2016 and Feltman et al. 2017 found a positive link between the intensity of Instagram use and both body surveillance and dietary behaviors or disordered eating.[349][348]\n\n\n\n### Suicide and self-harm[edit]\n\n\nPicardo et al. 2020 examined the relationship between self-harm posts and actual self-harm behaviours offline and found such content had negative emotional effects on some users. The study also reported preliminary evidence of the online posts affecting offline behavior, but stopped short of claiming causality. At the same time, some benefits for those who engage with self-harm content online have been suggested.[350] Instagram has published resources to help users in need of support.[351]\n\n\n\n### Sharenting risks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sharenting\n\nSharenting is when parents post content online, including images, about their children. Instagram is one of the most popular social media channels for sharenting. The hashtag #letthembelittle contains over 10 million images related to children on Instagram. Bare 2020 analysed 300 randomly selected, publicly available images under the hashtag and found that the corresponding images tended to contain children's personal information, including name, age and location.[352]\n\n\n\n### Instagram addiction[edit]\n\n\nSanz-Blas et al. 2019 showed that users who feel that they spend too much time on Instagram report higher levels of \"addiction\" to Instagram, which in turn was related to higher self-reported levels of stress induced by the app.[353] In a study focusing on the relationship between various psychological needs and \"addiction\" to Instagram by students, Foroughi et al. 2021 found that the desire for recognition and entertainment were predictors of students' addiction to Instagram. In addition, the study proved that addiction to Instagram negatively affected academic performance.[354] Additionally, Gezgin & Mihci 2020 found that frequent Instagram usage correlated with smartphone addiction.[355]\n\n\n\n## User characteristics and behavior[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Instagram app, running on the Android operating system\n### Users[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of most-followed Instagram accounts\n\nFollowing the release in October 2010, Instagram had one million registered users in December 2010.[356][357] In June 2011, it announced that it had 5 million users,[358] which increased to 10 million in September.[359][360] This growth continued to 30 million users in April 2012,[359][25] 80 million in July 2012,[361][362] 100 million in February 2013,[363][364] 130 million in June 2013,[365] 150 million in September 2013,[366][367] 300 million in December 2014,[368][369] 400 million in September 2015,[370][371] 500 million in June 2016,[372][373] 600 million in December 2016,[374][375] 700 million in April 2017,[376][377] and 800 million in September 2017.[378][379]\n\n\nIn June 2011, Instagram passed 100 million photos uploaded to the service.[380][381] This grew to 150 million in August 2011,[382][383] and by June 2013, there were over 16 billion photos on the service.[365] In October 2015, there existed over 40 billion photos.[384]\n\n\nIn October 2016, Instagram Stories reached 100 million active users, two months after launch.[385][386] This increased to 150 million in January 2017,[217][218] 200 million in April, surpassing Snapchat's user growth,[220][221][219] and 250 million active users in June 2017.[387][226]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram Direct had 375 million monthly users.[205][206][207]\n\n\n\n#### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2014[update], Instagram's users are divided equally with 50% iPhone owners and 50% Android owners. While Instagram has a neutral gender-bias format, 68% of Instagram users are female while 32% are male. Instagram's geographical use is shown to favor urban areas as 17% of US adults who live in urban areas use Instagram while only 11% of adults in suburban and rural areas do so. While Instagram may appear to be one of the most widely used sites for photo sharing, only 7% of daily photo uploads, among the top four photo-sharing platforms, come from Instagram. Instagram has been proven to attract the younger generation with 90% of the 150 million users under the age of 35. From June 2012 to June 2013, Instagram approximately doubled their number of users. With regards to income, 15% of US Internet users who make less than $30,000 per year use Instagram, while 14% of those making $30,000 to $50,000, and 12% of users who make more than $50,000 per year do so.[388] With respect to the education demographic, respondents with some college education proved to be the most active on Instagram with 23%. Following behind, college graduates consist of 18% and users with a high school diploma or less make up 15%. Among these Instagram users, 24% say they use the app several times a day.[389]\n\n\n\n### User behavior[edit]\n\n\nOngoing research continues to explore how media content on the platform affects user engagement. Past research has found that media which show peoples' faces receive more 'likes' and comments and that using filters that increase warmth, exposure, and contrast also boosts engagement.[390] Users are more likely to engage with images that depict fewer individuals compared to groups and also are more likely to engage with content that has not been watermarked, as they view this content as less original and reliable compared to user-generated content.[391] Recently Instagram has come up with an option for users to apply for a verified account badge; however, this does not guarantee every user who applies will get the verified blue tick.[392]\n\n\nThe motives for using Instagram among young people are mainly to look at posts, particularly for the sake of social interactions and recreation. In contrast, the level of agreement expressed in creating Instagram posts was lower, which demonstrates that Instagram's emphasis on visual communication is widely accepted by young people in social communication.[393]\n\n\n\n### Performative activism[edit]\n\n\nStarting in June 2020, Instagram was more widely used as a platform for social justice movements including the Black Lives Matter movement.[394][395] This has changed how people address activism, created a lack of consistency in protest, and is not widely accepted.[396][397] Most notably in 2020, Shirien Damra shared an illustration and tribute she made of George Floyd after his death, and it resulted in more than 3.4 million \"likes\", followed by many offline reproductions of the illustration.[398][399] Instagram-based activism (as well as other social media) has been criticized and dismissed for being performative, reductionist, and overly focused on aesthetics.[396]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nInstagram was the runner-up for \"Best Mobile App\" at the 2010 *TechCrunch* Crunchies in January 2011.[400] In May 2011, *Fast Company* listed CEO Kevin Systrom at number 66 in \"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\".[401] In June 2011, *Inc.* included co-founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \"30 Under 30\" list.[12]\n\n\nInstagram won \"Best Locally Made App\" in the *SF Weekly* Web Awards in September 2011.[402] *7x7Magazine'*s September 2011 issue featured Systrom and Krieger on the cover of their \"The Hot 20 2011\" issue.[403] In December 2011, Apple Inc. named Instagram the \"App of the Year\" for 2011.[404] In 2015, Instagram was named No. 1 by Mashable on its list of \"The 100 best iPhone apps of all time,\" noting Instagram as \"one of the most influential social networks in the world.\"[405] Instagram was listed among *Time*'s \"50 Best Android Applications for 2013\" list.[406]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Social media and suicide\n\nIn May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14–24, asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \"worst for young mental health\". Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whilst this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building. In response to the survey, Instagram stated that \"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\".[407][408] The company filters out the reviews and accounts. If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them.[409]\n\n\nIn 2017, researchers from Harvard University and University of Vermont demonstrated a machine learning tool that successfully outperformed general practitioners' diagnostic success rate for depression. The tool used color analysis, metadata components, and face detection of users' feeds.[410]\n\n\nIn 2019, Instagram began to test the hiding of like counts for posts made by its users, with the feature later made available to everyone.\n\n\nCorrelations have been made between Instagram content and dissatisfaction with one's body, as a result of people comparing themselves to other users. In a recent survey half of the applicants admitted to photo editing behavior which has been linked with concerns over body image.[411]\n\n\nIn October 2021, CNN published an article and interviews on two young women, Ashlee Thomas and Anastasia Vlasova, saying Instagram endangered their lives due to it having toxic effects on their diets.[412]\n\n\nIn October, 2023, 42 states from the USA filed a lawsuit against Instagram and parent company Meta, accusing them of contributing to a youth mental health crisis due to the addictive nature of the platforms. The lawsuit claims that Meta and its Instagram unit repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platforms and knowingly induced young children and teenagers into addictive and compulsive social media use. Meta representatives replied that they were disappointed with the lawsuit and were hoping instead to continue working with other companies from the industry to create new and better standards for applications teens use.[413][414]\n\n\n\n#### Negative comments[edit]\n\n\nIn response to abusive and negative comments on users' photos, Instagram has made efforts to give users more control over their posts and accompanying comments field. In July 2016, it announced that users would be able to turn off comments for their posts, as well as control the language used in comments by inputting words they consider offensive, which will ban applicable comments from showing up.[415][416] After the July 2016 announcement, the ability to ban specific words began rolling out early August to celebrities,[417] followed by regular users in September.[418] In December, the company began rolling out the abilities for users to turn off the comments and, for private accounts, remove followers.[419][420]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Instagram announced that it would automatically attempt to filter offensive, harassing, and \"spammy\" comments by default. The system is built using a Facebook-developed deep learning algorithm known as DeepText (first implemented on the social network to detect spam comments), which utilizes natural-language processing techniques, and can also filter by user-specified keywords.[421][422][409]\n\n\nIn September 2017, the company announced that public users would be able to limit who can comment on their content, such as only their followers or people they follow. At the same time, it updated its automated comment filter to support additional languages.[423][424]\n\n\nIn July 2019, the service announced that it would introduce a system to proactively detect problematic comments and encourage the user to reconsider their comment, as well as allowing users the ability to \"restrict\" others' abilities to communicate with them, citing that younger users felt the existing block system was too much of an escalation.[82]\n\n\nAn April 2022 study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that Instagram failed to act on 90% of abusive direct messages (DMs) sent to five high-profile women, despite the DMs being reported to moderators. The participants of the study included actress Amber Heard, journalist Bryony Gordon, television presenter Rachel Riley, activist Jamie Klingler and magazine founder Sharan Dhaliwal. Instagram disputed many of the study's conclusions.[425][426][427]\n\n\n\n### Culture[edit]\n\n\nOn August 9, 2012, English musician Ellie Goulding released a new music video for her song \"Anything Could Happen.\" The video only contained fan-submitted Instagram photographs that used various filters to represent words or lyrics from the song, and over 1,200 different photographs were submitted.[428]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2017, reports surfaced that a bug in Instagram's developer tools had allowed \"one or more individuals\" to gain access to the contact information, specifically email addresses and phone numbers, of several high-profile verified accounts, including its most followed user, Selena Gomez. The company said in a statement that it had \"fixed the bug swiftly\" and was running an investigation.[429][430] However, the following month, more details emerged, with a group of hackers selling contact information online, with the affected number of accounts in the \"millions\" rather than the previously assumed limitation on verified accounts. Hours after the hack, a searchable database was posted online, charging $10 per search.[431] *The Daily Beast* was provided with a sample of the affected accounts, and could confirm that, while many of the email addresses could be found with a Google search in public sources, some did not return relevant Google search results and thus were from private sources.[432] *The Verge* wrote that cybersecurity firm RepKnight had found contact information for multiple actors, musicians, and athletes,[431] and singer Selena Gomez's account was used by the hackers to post naked photos of her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber. The company admitted that \"we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted\", but believed that \"it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts\", though *TechCrunch* stated in its report that six million accounts were affected by the hack, and that \"Instagram services more than 700 million accounts; six million is not a small number\".[433]\n\n\nIn 2019, Apple pulled an app that let users stalk people on Instagram by scraping accounts and collecting data.[434]\n\n\nIran has DPI blocking for Instagram.[435]\n\n\n\n### Content ownership[edit]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2012, Instagram announced a change to its Terms of Service policy, adding the following sentence:[436]\n\n\n\n\n> To help us deliver interesting paid or sponsored content or promotions, you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.\n> \n> \n\n\nThere was no option for users to opt out of the changed Terms of Service without deleting their accounts before the new policy went into effect on January 16, 2013.[437] The move garnered severe criticism from users,[438][439] prompting Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom to write a blog post one day later, announcing that they would \"remove\" the offending language from the policy. Citing misinterpretations about its intention to \"communicate that we'd like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram\", Systrom also stated that it was \"our mistake that this language is confusing\" and that \"it is not our intention to sell your photos\". Furthermore, he wrote that they would work on \"updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear\".[440][438]\n\n\nThe policy change and its backlash caused competing photo services to use the opportunity to \"try to lure users away\" by promoting their privacy-friendly services,[441] and some services experienced substantial gains in momentum and user growth following the news.[442] On December 20, Instagram announced that the advertising section of the policy would be reverted to its original October 2010 version.[443] *The Verge* wrote about that policy as well, however, noting that the original policy gives the company right to \"place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content\", meaning that \"Instagram has always had the right to use your photos in ads, almost any way it wants. We could have had the exact same freakout last week, or a year ago, or the day Instagram launched\".[436]\n\n\nThe policy update also introduced an arbitration clause, which remained even after the language pertaining to advertising and user content had been modified.[444]\n\n\n\n### Facebook acquisition as a violation of US antitrust law[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Law School professor Tim Wu has given public talks explaining that Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram was a felony.[445] On February 26, 2019, the *New York Post* released an article stating that the FTC had discovered a memo authored by a senior Facebook official, revealing that the purpose behind the acquisition of Instagram was to remove a potential rival. Wu explains this is a violation of US antitrust law (see monopoly). Wu stated that this document was an email directly from Mark Zuckerberg, whereas the Post article had stated that their source had declined to say whether the high-ranking executive was the CEO. The article reported that the FTC \"has formed a task force to review \"anticompetitive conduct\" in the tech world amid concerns that tech companies are growing too powerful. The task force will look at \"the full panoply of remedies\" if it finds \"competitive harm,\" FTC competition bureau director Bruce Hoffman told reporters.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Algorithmic advertisement with a rape threat[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Olivia Solon, a reporter for *The Guardian*, posted a screenshot to her Instagram profile of an email she had received containing threats of rape and murder towards her. The photo post had received three likes and countless comments, and in September 2017, the company's algorithms turned the photo into an advertisement visible to Solon's sister. An Instagram spokesperson apologized and told *The Guardian* that \"We are sorry this happened – it's not the experience we want someone to have. This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram. Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person's Facebook friends.\" As noted by the technology media, the incident occurred at the same time parent company Facebook was under scrutiny for its algorithms and advertising campaigns being used for offensive and negative purposes.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### Human exploitation[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2021, *The Washington Post* published a report detailing a \"black market\" of unlicensed employment agents luring migrant workers from Africa and Asia into indentured servitude as maids in Persian Gulf countries, and using Instagram posts containing their personal information (including in some cases, passport numbers) to market them. Instagram deleted 200 accounts that had been reported by the *Post*, and a spokesperson stated that Instagram took this activity \"extremely seriously\", disabled 200 accounts found by the *Post* to be engaging in these activities, and was continuing to work on systems to automatically detect and disable accounts engaging in human exploitation.[448]\n\n\n\n### July 2022 Updates[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Instagram announced a set of updates which immediately received widespread backlash from its userbase. The changes included a feed more focused on Instagram's content algorithms, full-screen photo and video posts, and changing the format of all of its videos to Reels. The primary criticisms for these updates was Instagram being more like TikTok, instead of photo sharing. The backlash originated from an Instagram post and Change.org petition created by photographer Tati Bruening (under the username @illumitati) on July 23, 2022, featuring the statement \"Make Instagram Instagram again. (stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.) Sincerely, everyone.\". The post and petition gained mainstream attention after influencers Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian reposted the Instagram post; subsequently, the original post gained over 2 million likes on Instagram and over 275,000 signatures on Change.org.[449][450][451] Instagram walked back the update on July 28, with Meta saying \"We recognize that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and while we believe that Instagram needs to evolve as the world changes, we want to take the time to make sure we get this right.\"[452] Despite repeated attempts by Meta to shape Instagram to appear and operate more like TikTok, user engagement continued to lag far behind its rival as of 2022.[196]\n\n\n\n## Censorship and restricted content[edit]\n\n\n### Illicit drugs[edit]\n\n\nInstagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform. In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp. Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained:[453][454]\n\n\n\n\n> Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site. We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos.\n> \n> \n\n\nHowever, new incidents of illegal drug trade have occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 revelation, with Facebook, Inc., Instagram's parent company, asking users who come across such content to report the material, at which time a \"dedicated team\" reviews the information.[455]\n\n\nIn 2019, Facebook announced that influencers are no longer able to post any vape, tobacco products, and weapons promotions on Facebook and Instagram.[456]\n\n\n\n### Women's bodies[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Instagram deleted the account of Canadian photographer Petra Collins after she posted a photo of herself in which a very small area of pubic hair was visible above the top of her bikini bottom. Collins claimed that the account deletion was unfounded because it broke none of Instagram's terms and conditions.[457] Audra Schroeder of *The Daily Dot* further wrote that \"Instagram's terms of use state users can't post 'pornographic or sexually suggestive photos.'\" You can indeed find more sexually suggestive photos on the site than Collins', where women show the side of \"femininity\" the world is \"used to\" seeing and accepting.\"[458] Nick Drewe of *The Daily Beast* wrote a report the same month focusing on hashtags that users are unable to search for, including #sex, #bubblebutt, and #ballsack, despite allowing #faketits, #gunsforsale and #sexytimes, calling the discrepancy \"nonsensical and inconsistent\".[459]\n\n\nSimilar incidents occurred in January 2015, when Instagram deleted Australian fashion agency Sticks and Stones Agency's account because of a photograph including pubic hair sticking out of bikini bottoms,[460] and March 2015, when artist and poet Rupi Kaur's photos of menstrual blood on clothing were removed, prompting a rallying post on her Facebook and Tumblr accounts with the text \"We will not be censored\", gaining over 11,000 shares.[461]\n\n\nThe incidents have led to a #FreetheNipple campaign, aimed at challenging Instagram's removal of photos displaying women's nipples. Although Instagram has not made many comments on the campaign,[462] an October 2015 explanation from CEO Kevin Systrom highlighted Apple's content guidelines for apps published through its App Store, including Instagram, in which apps must designate the appropriate age ranking for users, with the app's current rating being 12+ years of age. However, this statement has also been called into question due to other apps with more explicit content allowed on the store, the lack of consequences for men exposing their bodies on Instagram, and for inconsistent treatment of what constitutes inappropriate exposure of the female body.[463][464]\n\n\nThe Iranian government offered moderators bribes up to $9,000 to delete specific accounts, with Masih Alinejad being targeted in particular.[465]\n\n\n\n### Censorship by countries[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(December 2021)*\n |\n\nCensorship of Instagram has occurred in several different countries.\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nOn January 11, 2020, Instagram and its parent company Facebook, Inc. are removing posts \"that voice support for slain Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani to comply with US sanctions\".[466]\n\n\nOn October 30, 2020, Instagram temporarily removed the \"recent\" tab on hashtag pages to prevent the spread of misinformation regarding the 2020 United States presidential election.[467] On January 7, 2021, United States President Donald Trump was banned from Instagram \"indefinitely\". Zuckerberg stated \"We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\"[468]\n\n\nA few days after Facebook changed its name to Meta, an Australian artist and technologist, Thea-Mai Baumann, had lost access to her @metaverse Instagram handle. Bauman tried to reclaim her access for a month, without success. Only after *The New York Times* published the story and contacted Meta's PR department, was the access restored.[469]\n\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet censorship in China\n\nInstagram has been blocked by China following the 2014 Hong Kong protests as many confrontations with police and incidents occurring during the protests were recorded and photographed. Hong Kong and Macau were not affected as they are part of special administrative regions of China.[470]\n\n\n\n#### Turkey[edit]\n\n\nTurkey is also known for its strict Internet censorship and periodically blocks social media including Instagram.[471]\n\n\n\n#### North Korea[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet in North Korea\n\nA few days after a fire incident that happened in the Koryo Hotel in North Korea on June 11, 2015, authorities began to block Instagram to prevent photos of the incident from being spread out.[472]\n\n\n\n#### Iran[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet censorship in Iran\n\nAs of September 2022, Instagram was one of the last freely available global social media sites in Iran.[473] Instagram is popular among Iranians because it is seen as an outlet for freedom and a \"window to the world.\"[474]\nStill, Iran has sentenced several citizens to prison for posts made on their Instagram accounts.[475] The Iranian government also blocked Instagram periodically during anti-government protests.[476] In July 2021, Instagram temporarily censored videos with the phrase \"death to Khamenei\".[477]\n\n\nIt was blocked along with WhatsApp permanently from September 2022 except for tourists and corporations who are asking for it.[478][479]\n\n\n\n#### Cuba[edit]\n\n\nThe Cuban government blocked access to several social media platforms, including Instagram, to curb the spread of information during the 2021 Cuban protests.[480]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nOn March 11, 2022, Russia announced it would ban Instagram due to alleged \"calls for violence against Russian troops\" on the platform during the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[481] On March 14, the ban took effect, with almost 80 million users losing access to Instagram.[482]\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nAs of January 7, 2023, the most followed person is Portuguese professional footballer Cristiano Ronaldo with over 530 million followers.[483] As of January 7, 2023, the most-liked photo on Instagram is a carousel of photos from footballer Lionel Messi celebrating winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup, The post has over 74 million likes.[484]\n\n\nIn 2022, Instagram was the second most downloaded mobile app of the year.[485]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* *Social Animals* (documentary film): A documentary film about three teenagers growing up on Instagram\n* Instagram model: a term for models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on Instagram\n* Instapoetry: a style of poetry which formed by sharing images of short poems by poets on Instagram.\n* Instagram Pier: a cargo working area in Hong Kong that gained its nickname due to its popularity on Instagram\n\n\n## System[edit]\n\n\nInstagram is written in Python.[486]\n\n\nInstagram artificial intelligence (AI) describes content for visually impaired people who use screen readers.[487]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of social networking services\n* Criticism of Facebook\n* Dronestagram\n* Internet celebrity\n* Instagram husband\n* Instagram face\n* Pheed\n* Pixnet\n* Social media and suicide\n* Timeline of social media\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The name is often colloquially abbreviated as **IG**, **Insta**, or **the Gram**,[6] legally Instagram, LLC,[7][8] also known as Instagram, Inc.[9][10]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Instagram\". *Instagram*.

It allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.[11]\n\n\nInstagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people daily.[11]\n\n\n\nOriginally launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion by June 2018. In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015[update], over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Instagram.\n\n![](image)Instagram icon from 2016 to 2022, when it was updated to include even more saturated colors\nInstagram began development in San Francisco as **Burbn**, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $682,200 in 2023) seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[12][13] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users.[14][15] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.[16]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding[edit]\n\n\nJosh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[17] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[17] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[17][18]\n\n\nThe first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 p.m. on July 16, 2010.[19][15] Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later at 9:24 p.m. It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its URL.[20][21][*better source needed*] On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store. In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million (equivalent to $9,357,057 in 2023) in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[22] The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million. In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million (equivalent to $65,610,000 in 2023) from venture capitalists with a valuation of $500 million (equivalent to $656,100,000 in 2023).[23] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.[24]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook[edit]\n\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones,[25][26] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.[27] The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements;[28][29] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were \"exploring an iOS version\".On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram for $1 billion (equivalent to $1,312,000,000 in 2023) in cash and stock ,[30][31][32] with a plan to keep the company independently managed.[33][34][35] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,[36] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.[37] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[38]\n\n\nThe deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN.[35] The deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[35] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was \"committed to building and growing Instagram independently.\"[35] According to *Wired*, the deal netted Systrom $400 million.[39]\n\n\nIn November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with limited functionality,[40] as well as a selection of *badges*, and web widget buttons to link to profiles.[41]\n\n\nSince the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.[42][43]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Instagram headquarters in Menlo Park\nIn June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website.[44][45][46] Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The *slideshow banner*[47][48] on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed. In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.\n\n\nIn April 2016, Instagram released a Windows 10 Mobile app, after years of demand from Microsoft and the public to release an app for the platform.[49][50] The platform previously had a beta version of Instagram, first released on November 21, 2013, for Windows Phone 8.[51][52][53] The new app added support for videos (viewing and creating posts or stories, and viewing live streams), album posts and direct messages.[54] Similarly, an app for Windows 10 personal computers and tablets was released in October 2016.[55][56] In May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a \"lightweight\" version of the Explore tab.[57][58]\n\n\nOn May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white flat design theme for the app's user interface, and a less skeuomorphistic, more abstract, \"modern\" and colorful icon.[59][60][61] Rumors of a redesign first started circulating in April, when *The Verge* received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that it was only a concept.[62]\n\n\nOn December 6, 2016, Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the user who posted a comment does not receive notifications about comment likes in their notification inbox. Uploaders can optionally decide to deactivate comments on a post.[63][64][65]\n\n\nThe mobile website allows uploading pictures since May 4, 2017. Image filters and the ability to upload videos were not introduced then.[66][67]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2019, the Windows 10 Mobile app was discontinued, though the mobile website remains available as a progressive web application (PWA) with limited functionality. The app remains available on Windows 10 computers and tablets, also updated to a PWA in 2020.\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: IGTV, removal of the like counter, management changes[edit]\n\n\nTo comply with the GDPR regulations regarding data portability, Instagram introduced the ability for users to download an archive of their user data in April 2018.[68][69][70]\n\n\nIGTV launched on June 20, 2018, as a standalone video application. The application was shut down and removed from app stores in March 2022, citing low usage and a shift to short-form video content.[71]\n\n\nOn September 24, 2018, Krieger and Systrom announced in a statement they would be stepping down from Instagram.[72][73] On October 1, 2018, it was announced that Adam Mosseri would be the new head of Instagram.[74][75][76]\n\n\nDuring Facebook F8, it was announced that Instagram would, beginning in Canada, pilot the removal of publicly displayed \"like\" counts for content posted by other users.[77] Like counts would only be visible to the user who originally posted the content. Mosseri stated that this was intended to have users \"worry a little bit less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care about.\"[78][79] It has been argued that low numbers of likes in relativity to others could contribute to a lower self-esteem in users.[79][77] The pilot began in May 2019, and was extended to 6 other markets in July.[79][80] The pilot was expanded worldwide in November 2019.[81] Also in July 2019, Instagram announced that it would implement new features designed to reduce harassment and negative comments on the service.[82]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal of the \"Following\" tab from the app, which had allowed users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was made official in October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that the feature was underused and that some users were \"surprised\" when they realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner.[83][84]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Instagram introduced a limit on the number of posts visible in page scrolling mode unless logged in. Until this point, public profiles had been available to all users, even when not logged in. Following the change, after viewing a number of posts a pop-up requires the user to log in to continue viewing content.[85][86][87]\n\n\nThat month, Instagram launched a separate app known as Threads. Similar to Snapchat, the app allowed users to communicate through messaging and video chats.[88] It was integrated with Instagram's \"Close friends\" feature, so that users could send images, photos, and texts privately to others, and also had Instagram's photo editing system embedded into the app.[89][90] However, Instagram discontinued this version of Threads in December 2021,[91] mainly due to most of its features being rolled out on Instagram itself, as well as low usage compared to other social media applications.[92] Threads was not well-received among Instagram's user base. Since its launch, only approximately 220,000 users globally downloaded the app, which represented less than 0.1% of Instagram's monthly active users, indicating a lack of success in driving adoption.[93]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: New features[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called \"Co-Watching\". The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[94]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Instagram began a pivot to video, introducing a new feature called \"Reels\".[95][96][97] The intent was to compete with the video-sharing site TikTok.[97][98][95] Instagram also added suggested posts in August 2020. After scrolling through posts from the past 48 hours, Instagram displays posts related to their interests from accounts they do not follow.[99]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Instagram began testing a new feature called Vertical Stories, said by some sources to be inspired by TikTok.[100] The same month, they also began testing the removal of ability to share feed posts to stories.[101]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Instagram launched a new feature in which four people can go live at once.[102] Instagram also announced that adults would not be allowed to message teens who don't follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.[103][104][105][106]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Instagram began allowing users in some regions to add pronouns to their profile page.[107][108]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2021, Meta services suffered their worst outage since 2008, bringing down Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.[109][110] Security experts identified the problem as possibly being DNS-related.[111]\n\n\nOn March 17, 2022, Zuckerberg confirmed plans to add non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the platform. In September 2022, Ireland's Data Protection Commission fined the company $402 million under privacy laws recently adopted by the European Union over how it handled the privacy data of minors.[112][113][114]\n\n\nAfter being trialled in mid-2022,[115] Instagram introduced Notes in December 2022. This feature allows users to share updates as short text posts of up to 60 characters with certain people, who can then reply to them using messaging on Instagram.[116][117]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Instagram introduced a new feature allowing users to browse and post GIFs in their comments.[118] That same month, Zuckerberg announced that Meta would start selling blue \"verified\" badges on Instagram and Facebook.[119]\n\n\nOn July 5, 2023, Meta launched Threads, a social network platform connected to Instagram that allows users to make public shortform blog posts comprising text, photos, and videos, as well as to converse with other users and reblog other users' posts. Threads aims to compete with Twitter.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Instagram began testing the removal of the ability to see \"recent\" posts from various hashtags.[123] This change became permanent and system wide a year later, and now hashtags can only be used to see a selection of curated content from \"top\" users.[124] These changes are ostensibly an attempt to hinder the spread of misinformation, while Instagram has also repeatedly stated that hashtags do not help posts get views.[125]\n\n\n\n## Features and tools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An original photograph (left) is automatically cropped to a square by Instagram, and has a filter added at the selection of the user (right).\n![](image)A photo collage of an unprocessed image (top left) modified with the 16 different Instagram filters available in 2011\nUsers can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds,[126] and geotag images with the name of a location.[127] Users can set their account as \"private\", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests.[128] Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites.[129] In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt–shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon.[130][131] Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well.[132][133][134] Users could formerly view a map of a user's geotagged photos. The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage.[135][136]\n\n\nSince December 2016, posts can be \"saved\" into a private area of the app.[137][138] The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into named collections.[139][140] Users can also \"archive\" their posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of \"likes\" or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the \"emergent behavior\" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content.[141][142] In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily interact with replies.[143][144]\n\n\nSince February 2017, up to ten pictures or videos can be included in a single post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel.[145][146] The feature originally limited photos to the square format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead.[147][148]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called \"focus mode,\" which gently blurs the background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected.[149] In November, Instagram began to support Alt text to add descriptions of photos for the visually impaired. They are either generated automatically using object recognition (using existing Facebook technology) or manually specified by the uploader.[150]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2021, Instagram launched a new feature named Instagram Live \"Rooms\" Let Four People Go Live Together.[151]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Instagram announced a new accessibility feature for videos on Instagram Reels and Stories to allow creators to place closed captions on their content.[152]\n\n\n\n### Hashtags[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other.[153][154] Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like \"photo\", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users.[155]\n\n\nUsers on Instagram have created \"trends\" through hashtags. The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on. Examples of popular trends include #SelfieSunday, in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays; #MotivationMonday, in which users post motivational photos on Mondays; #TransformationTuesday, in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present; #WomanCrushWednesday, in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably, as well as its #ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men; and #ThrowbackThursday, in which users post a photo from their past, highlighting a particular moment.[156][157]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Instagram began to allow users to follow hashtags, which display relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds.[158][159] The ability to search \"Recent\" hashtags was temporarily disabled during the 2020 US elections, to prevent the spread of misinformation.[160] In 2022 this was again tested on some users, and in April 2023 the ability to search recent hashtags was removed entirely. Now, users are only able to see a curated selection of \"popular\" posts using a given hashtag. Instagram states that this is to prevent abuse and that hashtags do not help users gain views, but it has been noted that using hashtags is the only free method for a user to reach past their existing followers.[161]\n\n\n\n### Explore[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Instagram introduced \"Explore\", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search.[162] The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations.[163] In April 2016, Instagram added a \"Videos You Might Like\" channel to the tab,[164][165] followed by an \"Events\" channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events,[166][167] followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October.[168][169] The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically curated page of the \"best\" Instagram Live videos currently airing.[170] In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places.[171]\n\n\n\n### Photographic filters[edit]\n\n\nInstagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images. In February 2012, Instagram added a \"Lux\" filter, an effect that \"lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast\".[172][173] In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters to be added to the Instagram filter family.[174]\n\n\n\n### Video[edit]\n\n\nInitially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013.[175][176] The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine.[177][178] In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos.[179][180] In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to 60 seconds.[181][182] Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post.[145][146][183]\n\n\n\n#### IGTV[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IGTV\n\nIGTV is a vertical video application launched by Instagram[184] in June 2018. Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website. IGTV allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650 MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to 60 minutes in length with a file size of up to 5.4 GB.[185] The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched, which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video.[186][187][188] In March 2022, the application was shut down.[71]\n\n\n\n#### Reels[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2019, it was reported that Instagram had begun to pilot a new video feature known as \"Reels\" in Brazil, expanding to France and Germany afterwards.[189] It is similar in functionality to the Chinese video-sharing service TikTok, with a focus on allowing users to record short videos set to pre-existing sound clips from other posts.[190] Users could make up to 15 (later 30) second videos using this feature.[191] Reels also integrates with existing Instagram filters and editing tools.[185]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Instagram rolled out Reels to India after TikTok was banned in the country.[192] The following month, Reels officially launched in 50 countries including the United States, Canada and United Kingdom.[193] Instagram has recently introduced a reel button on home page.[194]\n\n\nOn June 17, 2021, Instagram launched full-screen advertisements in Reels. The ads are similar to regular reels and can run up to 30 seconds. They are distinguished from regular content by the \"sponsored\" tag under the account name.[195]\n\n\nDespite the \"TikTokification\" of Reels and the parent company Meta spending millions on courting content creators, user engagement continued to lag far behind TikTok as of 2022.[196]\n\n\n\n### Instagram Direct[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging. Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people.[197][198][199] The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed. Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon. A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation.[200][201][202] A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages \"disappear\" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot.[203][204]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages, both permanent and ephemeral, into the same message threads.[205][206][207] In May, Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages, and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping.[208][209]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Direct became accessible from the Instagram website, allowing users to send direct messages from a web version using WebSocket technology.[210]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Facebook started merging Instagram Direct into Facebook Messenger. After the update (which is rolled out to a segment of the user base) the Instagram Direct icon transforms into Facebook Messenger icon.[211]\n\n\nIn March 2021, a feature was added that prevents adults from messaging users under 18 who do not follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### Instagram Stories[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature's similarities to Snapchat.[212][213] In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told *Recode* that \"Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter [and] some stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology\". Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as \"fair\", *Recode* wrote that \"he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences\". Systrom further stated that \"When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind. We did all that, we implemented that.\" He also told the publication that Snapchat \"didn't have filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.\"[214][215]\n\n\nIn November, Instagram added live video functionality to Instagram Stories, allowing users to broadcast themselves live, with the video disappearing immediately after ending.[216][170]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Instagram launched skippable ads, where five-second photo and 15-second video ads appear in-between different stories.[217][218][219]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers, a \"clone\" of Snapchat's functionality.[220][221][219]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters, letting users add specific visual features onto their faces.[222][223]\n\n\nLater in May, *TechCrunch* reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories, where public Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business, landmark or place's Instagram page.[224] A few days later, Instagram announced \"Story Search\", in which users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term.[171][225]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Instagram revised its live-video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next 24 hours, or discard the broadcast immediately.[226] In July, Instagram started allowing users to respond to Stories content by sending photos and videos, complete with Instagram effects such as filters, stickers, and hashtags.[227][228]\n\n\nStories were made available for viewing on Instagram's mobile and desktop websites in late August 2017.[229][230]\n\n\nOn December 5, 2017, Instagram introduced \"Story Highlights\",[231] also known as \"Permanent Stories\", which are similar to Instagram Stories, but don't expire. They appear as circles below the profile picture and biography and are accessible from the desktop website as well.\n\n\nIn June 2018, the daily active story users of Instagram had reached 400 million users, and monthly active users had reached 1 billion active users.[232]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\nEmily White joined Instagram as Director of Business Operations in April 2013.[233][234] She stated in an interview with *The Wall Street Journal* in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company.[235] White left Instagram in December 2013 to join Snapchat.[236][237] In August 2014, James Quarles became Instagram's Global Head of Business and Brand Development, tasked with overseeing advertisement, sales efforts, and developing new \"monetization products\", according to a spokesperson.[238]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Instagram announced that video and image ads would soon appear in feeds for users in the United States,[239][240] with the first image advertisements displaying on November 1, 2013.[241][242] Video ads followed nearly a year later on October 30, 2014.[243][244] In June 2014, Instagram announced the rollout of ads in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia,[245] with ads starting to roll out that autumn.[246]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Instagram announced it would implement \"carousel ads,\" allowing advertisers to display multiple images with options for linking to additional content.[247][248] The company launched carousel image ads in October 2015,[249][250] and video carousel ads in March 2016.[251]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Instagram announced that it had 200,000 advertisers on the platform.[252] This number increased to 500,000 by September 2016,[253] and 1 million in March 2017.[254][255]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Instagram launched new tools for business accounts, including business profiles, analytics and the ability to promote posts as ads. To access the tools, businesses had to link a corresponding Facebook page.[256] The new analytics page, known as Instagram Insights, allowed business accounts to view top posts, reach, impressions, engagement and demographic data.[256] Insights rolled out first in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, and expanded to the rest of the world later in 2016.[257][256][258]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Instagram added the ability for business accounts to add product links directing users to a purchase page or to save them to a \"shopping list.\"[259] In April 2019, Instagram added the option to \"Checkout on Instagram,\" which allows merchants to sell products directly through the Instagram app.[260]\n\n\nIn March 2020, via a blog post, Instagram announced that they are making major moderation changes in order to decrease the flow of disinformation, hoaxes and fake news regarding COVID-19 on its platform, \"We'll remove COVID-19 accounts from account recommendations, and we are working to remove some COVID-19 related content from Explore unless posted by a credible health organization. We will also start to downrank content in feed and Stories that has been rated false by third-party fact-checkers.\"[261]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Instagram launched a native affiliate marketing tool creators can use to earn commissions based on sales. Commission-enabled posts are labeled \"Eligible for Commission\" on the user side to identify them as affiliate posts. Launch partners included Sephora, MAC, and Kopari.[262]\n\n\n\n### Stand-alone apps[edit]\n\n\nInstagram has developed and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality. In July 2014, it released **Bolt**, a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen.[263][264] It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August, an iOS-exclusive app that uses \"clever algorithm processing\" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos.[265][266] Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May 2015, but there has been no official Hyperlapse app from Instagram for either of these platforms to date.[267] In October 2015, it released **Boomerang**, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop.[268][269]\n\n\n\n### Third-party services[edit]\n\n\nThe popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third-party services designed to integrate with it, including services for creating content to post on the service and generating content from Instagram photos (including physical print-outs), analytics, and alternative clients for platforms with insufficient or no official support from Instagram (such as in the past, iPads).[270][271]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Instagram announced that effective June 1, 2016, it would end \"feed\" API access to its platform in order to \"maintain control for the community and provide a clear roadmap for developers\" and \"set up a more sustainable environment built around authentic experiences on the platform\", including those oriented towards content creation, publishers, and advertisers. Additionally, third-party clients have been prohibited from using the text strings \"insta\" or \"gram\" in their name.[272] It was reported that these changes were primarily intended to discourage third-party clients replicating the entire Instagram experience (due to increasing monetization of the service), and security reasons (such as preventing abuse by automated click farms, and the hijacking of accounts). In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Instagram began to impose further restrictions on its API in 2018.[271][273][274]\n\n\nFor unlimited browsing of public Instagram profiles without having to create an account, as well as for anonymous browsing of someone else's Stories, has to use the Instagram profiles viewer.[275] Stories are more authentic than typical photos posted as posts because users know that in 24 hours their Stories will disappear if they don't add them as highlighted[276] (however users can check who saw their Story for 48 hours after it was published[277]). For this reason, they are very valuable for market research.[278]\n\n\n\n### Fact checking[edit]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2019, Facebook announced it would expand its fact checking programs towards Instagram,[279] by using third-party fact-checkers organizations false information is able to be identified, reviewed and labeled as false information. Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages, additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such. With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation. If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false.[280]\n\n\n\n### Algorithm and design changes[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user's timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm.[281] Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked,[282] but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates.[283][284][285] The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down,[286] nor provide a way to change it back, which they re-affirmed in 2020.[287][288] However, in December 2021, Adam Mosseri, in a Senate hearing on child safety issues, stated that the company is developing a version of the feed that would show user posts in chronological order.[289] He later clarified the company would introduce two modes: a classic chronological feed and a version of it that would let users pick \"favorite\" users whose posts would be shown at the top in chronological order while other posts would be mixed in below.[290]\n\n\nSince 2017, Instagram has employed the ability to reduce the prominence of accounts (\"shadowbanning\") it believes may be generating non-genuine engagement and spam (including excessive use of unneeded hashtags), preventing posts from appearing in search results and in the app's Explore section. In a now-deleted Facebook post, Instagram wrote that \"When developing content, we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags\".[291][292] Instagram has since been accused of extending the practice to censor posts under vague and inconsistent circumstances, particularly in regards to sexually suggestive material.[293]\n\n\nInstagram caused the userbase to fall into outrage with the December 2018 update.[294][295][296][297][298][*excessive citations*] They found an attempt to alter the flow of the feed from the traditional vertical scroll to emulate and piggy-back the popularity of their Instagram Stories with a horizontal scroll, by swiping left.[299] Various backtracking statements were released explaining it as a bug, or as a test release that had been accidentally deployed to too large an audience.[297][296]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Instagram replaced the activity feed tab with a new \"Shop\" tab, moving the activity feed to the top. The \"new post\" button was also relocated to the top and replaced with a Reels tab[300] The company states that \"the Shop tab gives you a better way to connect with brands and creators and discover products you love\" and the Reels tab \"makes it easier for you to discover short, fun videos from creators all over the world and people just like you.\"[301] However, users have not responded well to the change, taking their complaints to Twitter and Reddit, and *The New York Times* has shunned Reels in particular, saying \"Not only does Reels fail in every way as a TikTok clone, but it’s confusing, frustrating and impossible to navigate\".[302]\n\n\nAlso in 2020, Instagram rolled out a feature titled \"suggested posts\", which adds posts from accounts Instagram thinks a user would like to such user's feed.[303] The feature was met with controversy from both Reddit users[304] from *The Verge*, which reported that suggested posts would keep users glued to their feed, give Instagram more advertising space, and ultimately harm the mental health of users, while Instagram executive Julian Gutman rebutted, stating the feature was not intended to keep users glued to their screens.[305] Suggested posts received more controversy after Fast Company stated that the feature would be impossible to turn off.[306]\n\n\nOn June 23, 2021, Instagram announced a test change to the \"suggested posts\" feature. The company will put suggested posts ahead of posts from people who the user is following in the Instagram feed, citing positive reception as the reason for this change.[307]\n\n\n\n## Scientific studies[edit]\n\n\n### Harmful effect on teenage girls' mental health[edit]\n\n\nFacebook has known for years that its Instagram app is harmful to a large number of teenagers, according to research seen by *The Wall Street Journal*, but the company concealed the knowledge from lawmakers.[308] The internal Facebook presentations seen by the *Journal* in 2021 show that Instagram is toxic to a sizable percentage of its users, particularly teenage girls. More than 40% of Instagram's users are under 23 years old. The presentations were seen by the company's executives and the findings mentioned to Mark Zuckerberg in 2020, but when asked in March 2021 about Instagram's effect on young people, Zuckerberg defended the company's plan to launch an Instagram product for children under 13.[308] When asked by senators for its internal findings on the impact of Instagram on youth mental health, Facebook sent a six-page letter that did not include the company's research. The company told Forbes that its research is \"kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.\"[309] In a blog post, Instagram said that the WSJ story \"focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light.\"[310] On September 27, 2021, weeks after the WSJ report was released, Facebook announced that it had \"paused\" development of Instagram Kids, the Instagram product aimed at children. The company stated it was looking into concerns raised by the regulators and parents. Adam Mosseri stated that the company would return to the project as \"[t]he reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today.\"[311][312] Based on Facebook's leaked internal research, Instagram has had negative effects on the body image of one in three teenagers.[313] Leaked internal documents also indicate that two thirds of teen girls and 40 percent of teen boys experience negative social comparison, and that Instagram makes 20 percent of the teens feel worse about themselves. According to the leaked research, Instagram has higher impact on appearance comparison than TikTok or Snapchat.[314] 13 percent of British, and 6 percent of US, teenager users with suicidal thoughts could trace them to Instagram use.[313]\n\n\n\n### Depression, anxiety and stress[edit]\n\n\nKhodarahimi and Fathi found evidence that Instagram users displayed higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms compared to non-users.[315] However, Frison & Eggermont 2017 found that, among both boys and girls, browsing could predict the presence of depressive symptoms; liking and posting seemed to have no effect.[316] In addition, their study showed that the presence of depressive symptoms in a given user could positively predict that they would make posts.[316] The study showed that the viewing of celebrity and peer pictures could make the moods of women more negative.[316][317] In a 2021 study, Mun & Kim pointed out that Instagram users with a strong need for approval were more likely to falsely present themselves on their Instagram accounts, which in turn increased the likelihood of depression. However, depression was mitigated by the users' perception of their own popularity.[318]\n\n\nLub & Trub 2015 showed that following more strangers increases social comparisons and depressive symptoms.[319] Multiple studies have found that increasing time spent on Instagram increases social anxiety and anxiety related to personal traits, physical appearance, and high-stress body areas in particular.[320][321][322] Sherlock & Wagstaff 2019 showed that both the number of followers and followees can slightly increase anxiety over personal traits.[323] Additionally, Moujaes & Verrier 2020 observed a connection between online engagement with mothering-based influencers known as InstaMums and anxiety.[324] However, Mackson et al. 2019 suggested beneficial effects of Instagram use on anxiety symptoms.[325][324]\n\n\n\n### Body image[edit]\n\n\nInstagram users report higher body surveillance (the habitual monitoring of one's body shape and size),[326] appearance-related pressure,[327] eating-disorder-related-pathology[328] and lower body satisfaction[328] than non-users. Multiple studies have also shown that users who take more selfies before making a post, and those who strategically present themselves by participating in such activities as editing or manipulating selfies, report higher levels of body surveillance and body dissatisfaction, and lower body esteem overall.[329][330][331][332] Tiggermann et al. showed that facial satisfaction can decrease when one spends greater time editing selfies for Instagram. Comments related to appearance on Instagram can lead to higher dissatisfaction with one's body.[333][334][335][336]\n\n\n\n### Loneliness and social exclusion[edit]\n\n\nMackson et al. 2019 found that Instagram users were less lonely than non-users[325] and that Instagram membership predicts lower self-reported loneliness.[332] A 2021 study by Büttner & Rudertb also showed that not being tagged in an Instagram photo triggers the feeling of social exclusion and ostracism, especially for those with higher needs to belong.[337] However, Brailovskaia & Margraf 2018 found a significant positive relationship between Instagram membership and extraversion, life satisfaction, and social support. Their study showed only a marginally significant negative association between Instagram membership and self-conscientiousness.[338] Fioravanti et al. 2020 showed that women who had to take a break from Instagram for seven days reported higher life satisfaction compared to women who continued their habitual pattern of Instagram use. The effects seemed to be specific for women, where no significant differences were observed for men.[339] The relationship between Instagram use and the fear of missing out, or FOMO, has been confirmed in multiple studies.[340][341] Research shows that Instagram browsing predicts social comparison, which generates FOMO, which can ultimately lead to depression.[342]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol and drug use[edit]\n\n\nThere is a small positive correlation between the intensity of one's Instagram usage and alcohol consumption, with binge drinkers reporting greater intensity of Instagram use than non-binge drinkers.[343] Boyle et al. 2016 found a small to moderate positive relationship between alcohol consumption, enhanced drinking motives, and drinking behavior during college and Instagram usage,[344]\n\n\n\n### Eating disorders[edit]\n\n\nA comparison of Instagram users with non-users showed that boys with an Instagram account differ from boys without an account in terms of over-evaluation of their shape and weight, skipping meals, and levels of reported disordered eating cognitions. Girls with an Instagram account only differed from girls without an account in terms of skipping meals; they also had a stricter exercise schedule, a pattern not found in boys. This suggests a possible negative effect of Instagram usage on body satisfaction and disordered eating for both boys and girls.[332][345] Several studies identified a small positive relationship between time spent on Instagram and both internalization of beauty or muscular ideals and self-objectification.[332][346][347][348] Both Appel et al. 2016 and Feltman et al. 2017 found a positive link between the intensity of Instagram use and both body surveillance and dietary behaviors or disordered eating.[349][348]\n\n\n\n### Suicide and self-harm[edit]\n\n\nPicardo et al. 2020 examined the relationship between self-harm posts and actual self-harm behaviours offline and found such content had negative emotional effects on some users. The study also reported preliminary evidence of the online posts affecting offline behavior, but stopped short of claiming causality. At the same time, some benefits for those who engage with self-harm content online have been suggested.[350] Instagram has published resources to help users in need of support.[351]\n\n\n\n### Sharenting risks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sharenting\n\nSharenting is when parents post content online, including images, about their children. Instagram is one of the most popular social media channels for sharenting. The hashtag #letthembelittle contains over 10 million images related to children on Instagram. Bare 2020 analysed 300 randomly selected, publicly available images under the hashtag and found that the corresponding images tended to contain children's personal information, including name, age and location.[352]\n\n\n\n### Instagram addiction[edit]\n\n\nSanz-Blas et al. 2019 showed that users who feel that they spend too much time on Instagram report higher levels of \"addiction\" to Instagram, which in turn was related to higher self-reported levels of stress induced by the app.[353] In a study focusing on the relationship between various psychological needs and \"addiction\" to Instagram by students, Foroughi et al. 2021 found that the desire for recognition and entertainment were predictors of students' addiction to Instagram. In addition, the study proved that addiction to Instagram negatively affected academic performance.[354] Additionally, Gezgin & Mihci 2020 found that frequent Instagram usage correlated with smartphone addiction.[355]\n\n\n\n## User characteristics and behavior[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Instagram app, running on the Android operating system\n### Users[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of most-followed Instagram accounts\n\nFollowing the release in October 2010, Instagram had one million registered users in December 2010.[356][357] In June 2011, it announced that it had 5 million users,[358] which increased to 10 million in September.[359][360] This growth continued to 30 million users in April 2012,[359][25] 80 million in July 2012,[361][362] 100 million in February 2013,[363][364] 130 million in June 2013,[365] 150 million in September 2013,[366][367] 300 million in December 2014,[368][369] 400 million in September 2015,[370][371] 500 million in June 2016,[372][373] 600 million in December 2016,[374][375] 700 million in April 2017,[376][377] and 800 million in September 2017.[378][379]\n\n\nIn June 2011, Instagram passed 100 million photos uploaded to the service.[380][381] This grew to 150 million in August 2011,[382][383] and by June 2013, there were over 16 billion photos on the service.[365] In October 2015, there existed over 40 billion photos.[384]\n\n\nIn October 2016, Instagram Stories reached 100 million active users, two months after launch.[385][386] This increased to 150 million in January 2017,[217][218] 200 million in April, surpassing Snapchat's user growth,[220][221][219] and 250 million active users in June 2017.[387][226]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram Direct had 375 million monthly users.[205][206][207]\n\n\n\n#### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2014[update], Instagram's users are divided equally with 50% iPhone owners and 50% Android owners. While Instagram has a neutral gender-bias format, 68% of Instagram users are female while 32% are male. Instagram's geographical use is shown to favor urban areas as 17% of US adults who live in urban areas use Instagram while only 11% of adults in suburban and rural areas do so. While Instagram may appear to be one of the most widely used sites for photo sharing, only 7% of daily photo uploads, among the top four photo-sharing platforms, come from Instagram. Instagram has been proven to attract the younger generation with 90% of the 150 million users under the age of 35. From June 2012 to June 2013, Instagram approximately doubled their number of users. With regards to income, 15% of US Internet users who make less than $30,000 per year use Instagram, while 14% of those making $30,000 to $50,000, and 12% of users who make more than $50,000 per year do so.[388] With respect to the education demographic, respondents with some college education proved to be the most active on Instagram with 23%. Following behind, college graduates consist of 18% and users with a high school diploma or less make up 15%. Among these Instagram users, 24% say they use the app several times a day.[389]\n\n\n\n### User behavior[edit]\n\n\nOngoing research continues to explore how media content on the platform affects user engagement. Past research has found that media which show peoples' faces receive more 'likes' and comments and that using filters that increase warmth, exposure, and contrast also boosts engagement.[390] Users are more likely to engage with images that depict fewer individuals compared to groups and also are more likely to engage with content that has not been watermarked, as they view this content as less original and reliable compared to user-generated content.[391] Recently Instagram has come up with an option for users to apply for a verified account badge; however, this does not guarantee every user who applies will get the verified blue tick.[392]\n\n\nThe motives for using Instagram among young people are mainly to look at posts, particularly for the sake of social interactions and recreation. In contrast, the level of agreement expressed in creating Instagram posts was lower, which demonstrates that Instagram's emphasis on visual communication is widely accepted by young people in social communication.[393]\n\n\n\n### Performative activism[edit]\n\n\nStarting in June 2020, Instagram was more widely used as a platform for social justice movements including the Black Lives Matter movement.[394][395] This has changed how people address activism, created a lack of consistency in protest, and is not widely accepted.[396][397] Most notably in 2020, Shirien Damra shared an illustration and tribute she made of George Floyd after his death, and it resulted in more than 3.4 million \"likes\", followed by many offline reproductions of the illustration.[398][399] Instagram-based activism (as well as other social media) has been criticized and dismissed for being performative, reductionist, and overly focused on aesthetics.[396]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nInstagram was the runner-up for \"Best Mobile App\" at the 2010 *TechCrunch* Crunchies in January 2011.[400] In May 2011, *Fast Company* listed CEO Kevin Systrom at number 66 in \"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\".[401] In June 2011, *Inc.* included co-founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \"30 Under 30\" list.[12]\n\n\nInstagram won \"Best Locally Made App\" in the *SF Weekly* Web Awards in September 2011.[402] *7x7Magazine'*s September 2011 issue featured Systrom and Krieger on the cover of their \"The Hot 20 2011\" issue.[403] In December 2011, Apple Inc. named Instagram the \"App of the Year\" for 2011.[404] In 2015, Instagram was named No. 1 by Mashable on its list of \"The 100 best iPhone apps of all time,\" noting Instagram as \"one of the most influential social networks in the world.\"[405] Instagram was listed among *Time*'s \"50 Best Android Applications for 2013\" list.[406]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Social media and suicide\n\nIn May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14–24, asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \"worst for young mental health\". Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whilst this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building. In response to the survey, Instagram stated that \"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\".[407][408] The company filters out the reviews and accounts. If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them.[409]\n\n\nIn 2017, researchers from Harvard University and University of Vermont demonstrated a machine learning tool that successfully outperformed general practitioners' diagnostic success rate for depression. The tool used color analysis, metadata components, and face detection of users' feeds.[410]\n\n\nIn 2019, Instagram began to test the hiding of like counts for posts made by its users, with the feature later made available to everyone.\n\n\nCorrelations have been made between Instagram content and dissatisfaction with one's body, as a result of people comparing themselves to other users. In a recent survey half of the applicants admitted to photo editing behavior which has been linked with concerns over body image.[411]\n\n\nIn October 2021, CNN published an article and interviews on two young women, Ashlee Thomas and Anastasia Vlasova, saying Instagram endangered their lives due to it having toxic effects on their diets.[412]\n\n\nIn October, 2023, 42 states from the USA filed a lawsuit against Instagram and parent company Meta, accusing them of contributing to a youth mental health crisis due to the addictive nature of the platforms. The lawsuit claims that Meta and its Instagram unit repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platforms and knowingly induced young children and teenagers into addictive and compulsive social media use. Meta representatives replied that they were disappointed with the lawsuit and were hoping instead to continue working with other companies from the industry to create new and better standards for applications teens use.[413][414]\n\n\n\n#### Negative comments[edit]\n\n\nIn response to abusive and negative comments on users' photos, Instagram has made efforts to give users more control over their posts and accompanying comments field. In July 2016, it announced that users would be able to turn off comments for their posts, as well as control the language used in comments by inputting words they consider offensive, which will ban applicable comments from showing up.[415][416] After the July 2016 announcement, the ability to ban specific words began rolling out early August to celebrities,[417] followed by regular users in September.[418] In December, the company began rolling out the abilities for users to turn off the comments and, for private accounts, remove followers.[419][420]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Instagram announced that it would automatically attempt to filter offensive, harassing, and \"spammy\" comments by default. The system is built using a Facebook-developed deep learning algorithm known as DeepText (first implemented on the social network to detect spam comments), which utilizes natural-language processing techniques, and can also filter by user-specified keywords.[421][422][409]\n\n\nIn September 2017, the company announced that public users would be able to limit who can comment on their content, such as only their followers or people they follow. At the same time, it updated its automated comment filter to support additional languages.[423][424]\n\n\nIn July 2019, the service announced that it would introduce a system to proactively detect problematic comments and encourage the user to reconsider their comment, as well as allowing users the ability to \"restrict\" others' abilities to communicate with them, citing that younger users felt the existing block system was too much of an escalation.[82]\n\n\nAn April 2022 study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that Instagram failed to act on 90% of abusive direct messages (DMs) sent to five high-profile women, despite the DMs being reported to moderators. The participants of the study included actress Amber Heard, journalist Bryony Gordon, television presenter Rachel Riley, activist Jamie Klingler and magazine founder Sharan Dhaliwal. Instagram disputed many of the study's conclusions.[425][426][427]\n\n\n\n### Culture[edit]\n\n\nOn August 9, 2012, English musician Ellie Goulding released a new music video for her song \"Anything Could Happen.\" The video only contained fan-submitted Instagram photographs that used various filters to represent words or lyrics from the song, and over 1,200 different photographs were submitted.[428]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2017, reports surfaced that a bug in Instagram's developer tools had allowed \"one or more individuals\" to gain access to the contact information, specifically email addresses and phone numbers, of several high-profile verified accounts, including its most followed user, Selena Gomez. The company said in a statement that it had \"fixed the bug swiftly\" and was running an investigation.[429][430] However, the following month, more details emerged, with a group of hackers selling contact information online, with the affected number of accounts in the \"millions\" rather than the previously assumed limitation on verified accounts. Hours after the hack, a searchable database was posted online, charging $10 per search.[431] *The Daily Beast* was provided with a sample of the affected accounts, and could confirm that, while many of the email addresses could be found with a Google search in public sources, some did not return relevant Google search results and thus were from private sources.[432] *The Verge* wrote that cybersecurity firm RepKnight had found contact information for multiple actors, musicians, and athletes,[431] and singer Selena Gomez's account was used by the hackers to post naked photos of her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber. The company admitted that \"we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted\", but believed that \"it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts\", though *TechCrunch* stated in its report that six million accounts were affected by the hack, and that \"Instagram services more than 700 million accounts; six million is not a small number\".[433]\n\n\nIn 2019, Apple pulled an app that let users stalk people on Instagram by scraping accounts and collecting data.[434]\n\n\nIran has DPI blocking for Instagram.[435]\n\n\n\n### Content ownership[edit]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2012, Instagram announced a change to its Terms of Service policy, adding the following sentence:[436]\n\n\n\n\n> To help us deliver interesting paid or sponsored content or promotions, you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.\n> \n> \n\n\nThere was no option for users to opt out of the changed Terms of Service without deleting their accounts before the new policy went into effect on January 16, 2013.[437] The move garnered severe criticism from users,[438][439] prompting Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom to write a blog post one day later, announcing that they would \"remove\" the offending language from the policy. Citing misinterpretations about its intention to \"communicate that we'd like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram\", Systrom also stated that it was \"our mistake that this language is confusing\" and that \"it is not our intention to sell your photos\". Furthermore, he wrote that they would work on \"updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear\".[440][438]\n\n\nThe policy change and its backlash caused competing photo services to use the opportunity to \"try to lure users away\" by promoting their privacy-friendly services,[441] and some services experienced substantial gains in momentum and user growth following the news.[442] On December 20, Instagram announced that the advertising section of the policy would be reverted to its original October 2010 version.[443] *The Verge* wrote about that policy as well, however, noting that the original policy gives the company right to \"place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content\", meaning that \"Instagram has always had the right to use your photos in ads, almost any way it wants. We could have had the exact same freakout last week, or a year ago, or the day Instagram launched\".[436]\n\n\nThe policy update also introduced an arbitration clause, which remained even after the language pertaining to advertising and user content had been modified.[444]\n\n\n\n### Facebook acquisition as a violation of US antitrust law[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Law School professor Tim Wu has given public talks explaining that Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram was a felony.[445] On February 26, 2019, the *New York Post* released an article stating that the FTC had discovered a memo authored by a senior Facebook official, revealing that the purpose behind the acquisition of Instagram was to remove a potential rival. Wu explains this is a violation of US antitrust law (see monopoly). Wu stated that this document was an email directly from Mark Zuckerberg, whereas the Post article had stated that their source had declined to say whether the high-ranking executive was the CEO. The article reported that the FTC \"has formed a task force to review \"anticompetitive conduct\" in the tech world amid concerns that tech companies are growing too powerful. The task force will look at \"the full panoply of remedies\" if it finds \"competitive harm,\" FTC competition bureau director Bruce Hoffman told reporters.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Algorithmic advertisement with a rape threat[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Olivia Solon, a reporter for *The Guardian*, posted a screenshot to her Instagram profile of an email she had received containing threats of rape and murder towards her. The photo post had received three likes and countless comments, and in September 2017, the company's algorithms turned the photo into an advertisement visible to Solon's sister. An Instagram spokesperson apologized and told *The Guardian* that \"We are sorry this happened – it's not the experience we want someone to have. This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram. Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person's Facebook friends.\" As noted by the technology media, the incident occurred at the same time parent company Facebook was under scrutiny for its algorithms and advertising campaigns being used for offensive and negative purposes.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### Human exploitation[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2021, *The Washington Post* published a report detailing a \"black market\" of unlicensed employment agents luring migrant workers from Africa and Asia into indentured servitude as maids in Persian Gulf countries, and using Instagram posts containing their personal information (including in some cases, passport numbers) to market them. Instagram deleted 200 accounts that had been reported by the *Post*, and a spokesperson stated that Instagram took this activity \"extremely seriously\", disabled 200 accounts found by the *Post* to be engaging in these activities, and was continuing to work on systems to automatically detect and disable accounts engaging in human exploitation.[448]\n\n\n\n### July 2022 Updates[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Instagram announced a set of updates which immediately received widespread backlash from its userbase. The changes included a feed more focused on Instagram's content algorithms, full-screen photo and video posts, and changing the format of all of its videos to Reels. The primary criticisms for these updates was Instagram being more like TikTok, instead of photo sharing. The backlash originated from an Instagram post and Change.org petition created by photographer Tati Bruening (under the username @illumitati) on July 23, 2022, featuring the statement \"Make Instagram Instagram again. (stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.) Sincerely, everyone.\". The post and petition gained mainstream attention after influencers Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian reposted the Instagram post; subsequently, the original post gained over 2 million likes on Instagram and over 275,000 signatures on Change.org.[449][450][451] Instagram walked back the update on July 28, with Meta saying \"We recognize that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and while we believe that Instagram needs to evolve as the world changes, we want to take the time to make sure we get this right.\"[452] Despite repeated attempts by Meta to shape Instagram to appear and operate more like TikTok, user engagement continued to lag far behind its rival as of 2022.[196]\n\n\n\n## Censorship and restricted content[edit]\n\n\n### Illicit drugs[edit]\n\n\nInstagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform. In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp. Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained:[453][454]\n\n\n\n\n> Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site. We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos.\n> \n> \n\n\nHowever, new incidents of illegal drug trade have occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 revelation, with Facebook, Inc., Instagram's parent company, asking users who come across such content to report the material, at which time a \"dedicated team\" reviews the information.[455]\n\n\nIn 2019, Facebook announced that influencers are no longer able to post any vape, tobacco products, and weapons promotions on Facebook and Instagram.[456]\n\n\n\n### Women's bodies[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Instagram deleted the account of Canadian photographer Petra Collins after she posted a photo of herself in which a very small area of pubic hair was visible above the top of her bikini bottom. Collins claimed that the account deletion was unfounded because it broke none of Instagram's terms and conditions.[457] Audra Schroeder of *The Daily Dot* further wrote that \"Instagram's terms of use state users can't post 'pornographic or sexually suggestive photos.'\" You can indeed find more sexually suggestive photos on the site than Collins', where women show the side of \"femininity\" the world is \"used to\" seeing and accepting.\"[458] Nick Drewe of *The Daily Beast* wrote a report the same month focusing on hashtags that users are unable to search for, including #sex, #bubblebutt, and #ballsack, despite allowing #faketits, #gunsforsale and #sexytimes, calling the discrepancy \"nonsensical and inconsistent\".[459]\n\n\nSimilar incidents occurred in January 2015, when Instagram deleted Australian fashion agency Sticks and Stones Agency's account because of a photograph including pubic hair sticking out of bikini bottoms,[460] and March 2015, when artist and poet Rupi Kaur's photos of menstrual blood on clothing were removed, prompting a rallying post on her Facebook and Tumblr accounts with the text \"We will not be censored\", gaining over 11,000 shares.[461]\n\n\nThe incidents have led to a #FreetheNipple campaign, aimed at challenging Instagram's removal of photos displaying women's nipples. Although Instagram has not made many comments on the campaign,[462] an October 2015 explanation from CEO Kevin Systrom highlighted Apple's content guidelines for apps published through its App Store, including Instagram, in which apps must designate the appropriate age ranking for users, with the app's current rating being 12+ years of age. However, this statement has also been called into question due to other apps with more explicit content allowed on the store, the lack of consequences for men exposing their bodies on Instagram, and for inconsistent treatment of what constitutes inappropriate exposure of the female body.[463][464]\n\n\nThe Iranian government offered moderators bribes up to $9,000 to delete specific accounts, with Masih Alinejad being targeted in particular.[465]\n\n\n\n### Censorship by countries[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(December 2021)*\n |\n\nCensorship of Instagram has occurred in several different countries.\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nOn January 11, 2020, Instagram and its parent company Facebook, Inc. are removing posts \"that voice support for slain Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani to comply with US sanctions\".[466]\n\n\nOn October 30, 2020, Instagram temporarily removed the \"recent\" tab on hashtag pages to prevent the spread of misinformation regarding the 2020 United States presidential election.[467] On January 7, 2021, United States President Donald Trump was banned from Instagram \"indefinitely\". Zuckerberg stated \"We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\"[468]\n\n\nA few days after Facebook changed its name to Meta, an Australian artist and technologist, Thea-Mai Baumann, had lost access to her @metaverse Instagram handle. Bauman tried to reclaim her access for a month, without success. Only after *The New York Times* published the story and contacted Meta's PR department, was the access restored.[469]\n\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet censorship in China\n\nInstagram has been blocked by China following the 2014 Hong Kong protests as many confrontations with police and incidents occurring during the protests were recorded and photographed. Hong Kong and Macau were not affected as they are part of special administrative regions of China.[470]\n\n\n\n#### Turkey[edit]\n\n\nTurkey is also known for its strict Internet censorship and periodically blocks social media including Instagram.[471]\n\n\n\n#### North Korea[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet in North Korea\n\nA few days after a fire incident that happened in the Koryo Hotel in North Korea on June 11, 2015, authorities began to block Instagram to prevent photos of the incident from being spread out.[472]\n\n\n\n#### Iran[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet censorship in Iran\n\nAs of September 2022, Instagram was one of the last freely available global social media sites in Iran.[473] Instagram is popular among Iranians because it is seen as an outlet for freedom and a \"window to the world.\"[474]\nStill, Iran has sentenced several citizens to prison for posts made on their Instagram accounts.[475] The Iranian government also blocked Instagram periodically during anti-government protests.[476] In July 2021, Instagram temporarily censored videos with the phrase \"death to Khamenei\".[477]\n\n\nIt was blocked along with WhatsApp permanently from September 2022 except for tourists and corporations who are asking for it.[478][479]\n\n\n\n#### Cuba[edit]\n\n\nThe Cuban government blocked access to several social media platforms, including Instagram, to curb the spread of information during the 2021 Cuban protests.[480]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nOn March 11, 2022, Russia announced it would ban Instagram due to alleged \"calls for violence against Russian troops\" on the platform during the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[481] On March 14, the ban took effect, with almost 80 million users losing access to Instagram.[482]\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nAs of January 7, 2023, the most followed person is Portuguese professional footballer Cristiano Ronaldo with over 530 million followers.[483] As of January 7, 2023, the most-liked photo on Instagram is a carousel of photos from footballer Lionel Messi celebrating winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup, The post has over 74 million likes.[484]\n\n\nIn 2022, Instagram was the second most downloaded mobile app of the year.[485]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* *Social Animals* (documentary film): A documentary film about three teenagers growing up on Instagram\n* Instagram model: a term for models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on Instagram\n* Instapoetry: a style of poetry which formed by sharing images of short poems by poets on Instagram.\n* Instagram Pier: a cargo working area in Hong Kong that gained its nickname due to its popularity on Instagram\n\n\n## System[edit]\n\n\nInstagram is written in Python.[486]\n\n\nInstagram artificial intelligence (AI) describes content for visually impaired people who use screen readers.[487]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of social networking services\n* Criticism of Facebook\n* Dronestagram\n* Internet celebrity\n* Instagram husband\n* Instagram face\n* Pheed\n* Pixnet\n* Social media and suicide\n* Timeline of social media\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The name is often colloquially abbreviated as **IG**, **Insta**, or **the Gram**,[6] legally Instagram, LLC,[7][8] also known as Instagram, Inc.[9][10]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Instagram\". *Instagram*.

Users are also three times as likely to be younger than 50 years old, with the median age of adult U.S. users being 40 years old. The survey found that 10% of users who are most active on Twitter are responsible for 80% of all tweets, focusing mainly on the topics of politics and women.[315]\n\n\n\n### Content[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Content of tweets according to Pear Analytics in August 2009 News (3.6%)\n Spam (3.8%)\n Self-promotion (5.9%)\n Pointless babble (40.1%)\n Conversational (37.6%)\n Pass-along value (8.7%)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome major brands including Dyson, Mazda, Forbes, and PBS Kids suspended their marketing campaigns and pulled their ads from the platform, after an investigation into child porn on twitter showed that Twitter failed to suspend 70% of the accounts that shared or solicited the prohibited content.

The majority of Twitter users skew to the American political left.[311][312][18]\n\n\nIn 2012, the country with the most active users on Twitter was the United States.[313] A 2016 Pew research poll found that Twitter is used by 24% of all online US adults. It was equally popular with men and women (24% and 25% of online Americans respectively), but more popular with younger (36% of 18–29 year olds) generations.[314]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to research published in April 2014, around 44% of user accounts have never tweeted.[319] About 22% of Americans say they have ever used Twitter, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey.[320] In 2009, Nielsen Online reported that Twitter had a user-retention rate of forty percent. Many people stop using the service after a month; therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all Internet users.[321] Noting how demographics of Twitter users differ from the average Americans, commentators have cautioned against media narratives that treat Twitter as representative of the population,[322] adding that only 10% of users Tweet actively, and that 90% of Twitter users have Tweeted no more than twice. In 2016, shareholders sued Twitter, alleging it \"artificially inflated its stock price by misleading them about user engagement\". The company announced on September 20, 2021, that it would pay $809.5 million to settle this class-action lawsuit.[323]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n436. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Twitter now lets businesses handle their employees' blue ticks, for a hefty price\". *Mashable*.

On launch, the concept was limited to NBCUniversal channels and Xfinity cable television subscribers.[651] A year later, Twitter acquired SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph, and partnered with research company Kantar (which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013), which strengthened Twitter's dominance of the \"second screen\" – TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Malicious and fake accounts[edit]\n\n\nBetween January and late July 2017, Twitter had identified and shut down over 7,000 fake accounts created by Iranian influence operations.[495]\n\n\nIn May 2018, in response to scrutiny over the misuse of Twitter by those seeking to maliciously influence elections, Twitter announced that it would partner with the nonprofit organization Ballotpedia to add special labels verifying the authenticity of political candidates running for election in the U.S.[496][497]\n\n\nIn December 2019, Twitter removed 5,929 accounts for violating their manipulation policies. The company investigated and attributed these accounts to a single state-run information operation, which originated in Saudi Arabia. The accounts were reported to be a part of a larger group of 88,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior. However, Twitter did not disclose all of them as some could possibly be legitimate accounts taken over through hacking.[498]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2023, the gold checkmark was made available for organizations to purchase through the Verified Organizations program (formerly called Twitter Blue for Business).[436][437]\n\n\n\n### Privacy[edit]\n\n\nTweets are public, but users can also send private \"direct messages\".[438] Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public, though accounts can be changed to \"protected\" which limits this information (and all tweets) to approved followers.[439] Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its privacy policy. The service also reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands.[440] Advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads[441] directed specifically to the user.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2015, following updated terms of service and privacy policy, Twitter users outside the United States were legally served by the Ireland-based Twitter International Company instead of Twitter, Inc. The change made these users subject to Irish and European Union data protection laws[455]\n\n\nOn April 8, 2020, Twitter announced that users outside of the European Economic Area or United Kingdom (thus subject to GDPR) will no longer be allowed to opt out of sharing \"mobile app advertising measurements\" to Twitter third-party partners.[456]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn July 15, 2020, a major hack of Twitter affected 130 high-profile accounts, both verified and unverified ones such as Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk; the hack allowed bitcoin scammers to send tweets via the compromised accounts that asked the followers to send bitcoin to a given public address, with the promise to double their money.[404] Within a few hours, Twitter disabled tweeting and reset passwords from all verified accounts.[404] Analysis of the event revealed that the scammers had used social engineering to obtain credentials from Twitter employees to access an administration tool used by Twitter to view and change these accounts' personal details as to gain access as part of a \"smash and grab\" attempt to make money quickly, with an estimated US$120,000 in bitcoin deposited in various accounts before Twitter intervened.[405] Several law enforcement entities including the FBI launched investigations into the attack.[406]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late 2009, the \"Twitter Lists\" feature was added, making it possible for users to follow a curated list of accounts all at once, rather than following individual users.[180][246] Currently, lists can be set to either public or private. Public lists may be recommended to users via the general Lists interface and appear in search results.[247] If a users follows a public list, it will appear in the \"View Lists\" section of their profile, so that other users may quickly find it and follow it as well.[248] Private lists can only be followed if the creator shares a specific link to their list. Lists add a separate tab to the Twitter interface with the title of the list, such as \"News\" or \"Economics\".\n\n\n\n#### Moments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWithin a year, the Larry the Bird logo underwent a redesign by Stone and Pascuzzo to eliminate the cartoon features, leaving a solid silhouette of Larry the Bird that was used from 2010 through 2012.[325] In 2012, Douglas Bowman created a further simplified version of Larry the Bird, keeping the solid silhouette but making it more similar to a mountain bluebird.[327] This logo was simply called the \"Twitter Bird\" and was used until July 2023.[325][328][329]\n\n\n\n![The official X profile.](image)The official X profile, on the site, as of August 2023.\nOn July 22, 2023, Elon Musk announced that the service would be re-branded to \"X\",[330] in his pursuit of creating an \"everything app\".[329] Musk's X profile picture, along with the official X accounts, and the icons when browsing/signing up for the platform, were updated to reflect the new logo.[331] The logo (𝕏) is a Unicode mathematical alphanumeric symbol for the letter \"X\" styled in double-strike bold.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs part of its efforts to monetize porn, Twitter held an internal investigation that reported in April 2022, \"Twitter cannot accurately detect child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity at scale.\"[527]\n\n\nJohn Doe et al. vs. Twitter, a civil lawsuit filed in the 9th Circuit Court, alleges that Twitter benefited from sex trafficking and refused to remove the illegal tweets when first informed of them.[528][529] In an amicus brief filed in the case, the NCMEC said, \"The children informed the company that they were minors, that they had been 'baited, harassed, and threatened' into making the videos, that they were victims of 'sex abuse' under investigation by law enforcement\" but Twitter failed to remove the videos, \"allowing them to be viewed by hundreds of thousands of the platform's users\".[527]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTwitter is banned completely in Russia,[569] Iran, China and North Korea,[570] and has been intermittently blocked in numerous countries including Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, Turkey, Venezuela and Turkmenistan on different bases.[571][572][573][574][575][576] In 2016, Twitter cooperated with the Israeli government to remove certain content originating outside Israel from tweets seen in Israel.[577] In the 11th biannual transparency report published on September 19, 2017, Twitter said that Turkey was the first among countries where about 90 percent of removal requests came from, followed by Russia, France and Germany.[578] Twitter stated that between July 1 and December 31, 2018, \"We received legal demands relating to 27,283 accounts from 47 different countries, including Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, and Slovenia for the first time.\"[579] As part of evidence to a U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, Twitter began to place a larger focus on live streaming video programming, hosting various events including streams of the Republican and Democratic conventions during the U.S. presidential campaign as part of a partnership with CBS News,[222] Dreamhack and ESL esports events,[223] and winning a bid for non-exclusive streaming rights to ten NFL *Thursday Night Football* games in the 2016 season.[223][224]\n\n\nDuring an event in New York in May 2017, Twitter announced that it planned to construct a 24-hour streaming video channel hosted within the service, featuring content from various partners.[223][225] CEO Jack Dorsey stated that the digital video strategy was part of a goal for Twitter to be \"the first place that anyone hears of anything going on that matters to them\"; as of the first quarter of 2017[update], Twitter had over 200 content partners, who streamed over 800 hours of video over 450 events.[226]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 28, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. Musk promptly fired several top executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal.\n\n#### Post-acquisition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Twitter under Elon Musk\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | It has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled *Twitter\\_under\\_Elon\\_Musk#Post-acquisition*.

He later tweeted that if he found a logo, the rebrand would be implemented the next day. Subsequently, he tweeted a video of the Twitter logo glitching into an abstract X logo.[161]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn August 5, 2022, Twitter disclosed that a bug introduced in a June 2021 update to the service allowed threat actors to link email addresses and phone numbers to twitter user's accounts.[407][408] The bug was reported through Twitter's bug bounty program in January 2022 and subsequently fixed. While Twitter originally believed no one had taken advantage of the vulnerability, it was later revealed that a user on the online hacking forum Breached Forums had used the vulnerability to compile a list of over 5.4 million user profiles, which they offered to sell for $30,000.[409][410] The information compiled by the hacker includes user's screen names, location and email addresses which could be utilised in phishing attacks or used to deanonymize accounts running under pseudonyms.\n\n\n\n### Outages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n286. **^** Hatmaker, Taylor (September 1, 2021). \"Twitter rolls out paid subscription 'Super Follows' to let you cash in on your tweets\".

This was brought on by Twitter's failure to comply with the new IT rules introduced in 2021 with a filing stating that the company failed to appoint executives to govern user content on the platform.[522] Twitter stated to India's government in August 2021 that they have appointed permanent executives and staff to provide for compliance to these new IT rules.[523]\n\n\n\n#### Pornography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Arab Spring in early 2011, the number of hashtags mentioning the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt increased.[509] A study by the Dubai School of Government found that only 0.26% of the Egyptian population, 0.1% of the Tunisian population and 0.04% of the Syrian population are active on Twitter.[510]\n\n\n\n#### Governments[edit]\n\n\nAccording to documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published in July 2014, the United Kingdom's GCHQ has a tool named BIRDSONG for \"automated posting of Twitter updates\", and a tool named BIRDSTRIKE for \"Twitter monitoring and profile collection\".[511][512]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most tweeted moment in the history of Twitter occurred on August 2, 2013; during a Japanese television airing of the Studio Ghibli film *Castle in the Sky*, fans simultaneously tweeted the word *balse* (バルス)—the incantation for a destruction spell used during its climax, after it was uttered in the film.

Twitterrific's Sean Heber confirmed in a blog post that the 16-year-old app has been discontinued. \"We are sorry to say that the app's sudden and undignified demise is due to an unannounced and undocumented policy change by an increasingly capricious Twitter – a Twitter that we no longer recognize as trustworthy nor want to work with any longer.\"[377]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Twitter announced it would be ending free access to Twitter API, and began offering paid tier plans with a more limited access.[378]\n\n\n\n### Innovators patent agreement[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2011, Twitter announced that it would offer small businesses a self-service advertising system.[339] The self-service advertising platform was launched in March 2012 to American Express card members and merchants in the U.S. on an invite-only basis.[340] To continue their advertising campaign, Twitter announced on March 20, 2012, that promoted tweets would be introduced to mobile devices.[341] In April 2013, Twitter announced that its Twitter Ads self-service platform, consisting of promoted tweets and promoted accounts, was available to all U.S. users without an invite.[340]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2016, Twitter launched Instant Unlock Card, a new feature that encourages people to tweet about a brand in order to earn rewards and utilize the social media network's conversational ads.

The files describe internal discussion as related to Twitter's moderation steps in events such as the breaking of the Hunter Biden laptop controversy, shadow banning of some conservative commentators' accounts, and the decision to block Trump. While some on the right saw the documents as evidence of Twitter's liberal bias and hostility to free speech, many people on the left described them as a reflection of how difficult it is for social media platforms to make tough decisions about content moderation.[126][127][128]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe counters for \"likes\", \"reposts\", and replies appear next to the respective buttons in timelines such as on profile pages and search results. Counters for likes and reposts exist on a post’s standalone page too.

The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous retweet record within forty minutes, and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour.[662][663][664] By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times.[662] On May 9, 2017, Ellen's record was broken by Carter Wilkerson (@carterjwm) by collecting nearly 3.5 million retweets in a little over a month.[665] This record was broken when Yusaku Maezawa announced a giveaway on Twitter in January 2019, accumulating 4.4 million retweets. A similar tweet he made in December 2019 was retweeted 3.8 million times.[666]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.[55] \"The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,\" remarked *Newsweek*'s Steven Levy. \"Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\"[56] Reaction at the conference was highly positive.[57] Twitter staff received the festival's Web Award prize with the remark \"we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!\"[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 2006 until 2010, Twitter's developer platform experienced strong growth and a highly favorable reputation. Developers built upon the public API to create the first Twitter mobile phone clients as well as the first URL shortener. Between 2010 and 2012, however, Twitter made a number of decisions that were received unfavorably by the developer community.[368] In 2010, Twitter mandated that all developers adopt OAuth authentication with just 9 weeks of notice.[369] Later that year, Twitter launched its own URL shortener, in direct competition with some of its most well-known third-party developers.[370] And in 2012, Twitter introduced stricter usage limits for its API, \"completely crippling\" some developers.[371][372] While these moves successfully increased the stability and security of the service, they were broadly perceived as hostile to developers, causing them to lose trust in the platform.[373]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy September 2022, the program had expanded to 15,000 users.[622] In October 2022 *The Verge* found that the most commonly published notes were related to COVID-19 misinformation based on historical useage.[623] In November 2022, at the request of new owner Elon Musk, Birdwatch was rebranded to *Community Notes,* taking an open-source approach to deal with misinformation,[624] and expanded to Europe and countries outside of the US.[158][600][604] In May 2023, Community Notes was extended to include notes on misleading images[625] and in September 2023 further extended to videos, but only for a group of power-users referred to as \"Top Writers\".[626] Twitter subsequently ended the ability to report misleading posts, instead relying exclusively on Community Notes,[627] with contributors proposing over 21,200 notes on the platform.[616]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n539. **^** Grandjean, Martin (2016). \"A social network analysis of Twitter: Mapping the digital humanities community\". *Cogent Arts & Humanities*. **3** (1): 1171458. doi:10.1080/23311983.2016.1171458.

Twitter had intended for fleets to encourage more users to tweet regularly, rather than simply consume other users' tweets, but instead fleets were generally used by users who already tweeted a lot.

The council's inaugural members included 50 organizations and individuals.[472] The announcement of Twitter's \"Trust & Safety Council\" was met with objection from parts of its userbase.[473][474] Critics accused the member organizations of being heavily skewed towards \"the restriction of hate speech\" and a *Reason* article expressed concern that \"there's not a single uncompromising anti-censorship figure or group on the list\".[475][476]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement an \"Innovators Patent Agreement\" which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents for defensive purposes.[*clarify*][379]\n\n\n\n### Open source[edit]\n\n\nTwitter has a history of both using and releasing open-source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service.[380] A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open-source projects which they have used, from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala.[381] Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side package manager.[382] The popular Bootstrap frontend framework was also started at Twitter and is 10th most popular repository on GitHub.[383]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n199. **^** Kutty, Darpana (October 15, 2009). \"Twitter, Bharti Airtel Tie-Up To Activate Twitter SMS Service in India\". *topnews.in*.

Twitter initially intended the feature to be used by its in-house editorial team and other partners; they populated a dedicated tab in Twitter's apps, chronicling news headlines, sporting events, and other content.[249][250] In September 2016, creation of moments became available to all Twitter users.[251]\n\n\n\n### Algorithm[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwitter relies on open-source software.[358] The Twitter Web interface uses the Ruby on Rails framework,[359] deployed on a performance enhanced Ruby Enterprise Edition implementation of Ruby.[360][*needs update*]\n\n\nIn the early days of Twitter, tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally sharded (large databases were split based on time of posting). After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.[71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn August 2013, Twitter announced plans to introduce a \"report abuse\" button for all versions of the site following uproar, including a petition with 100,000 signatures, over Tweets that included rape and death threats to historian Mary Beard, feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and the member of parliament Stella Creasy.[460][461][462] Twitter announced new reporting and blocking policies in December 2014,[463][464][465][466] including a blocking mechanism devised by Randi Harper, a target of GamerGate.[467][468][469] In February 2015, CEO Dick Costolo said he was 'frankly ashamed' at how poorly Twitter handled trolling and abuse, and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result.[470]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwitter allows users to update their profile via their mobile phones either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets.[187] Twitter has been compared to a web-based Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client.[188] In a 2009 *Time* magazine essay, technology author Steven Johnson described the basic mechanics of Twitter as \"remarkably simple\":\n\n\n\n\n> As a social network, Twitter revolves around the principle of followers. When you choose to follow another Twitter user, that user's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page.

The original logo, which was simply the word *Twitter*, was in use from its launch in March 2006. It was accompanied by an image of a bird which was later discovered to be a piece of clip art created by the British graphic designer Simon Oxley.[325] A new logo had to be redesigned by founder Biz Stone with help from designer Philip Pascuzzo, which resulted in a more cartoon-like bird in 2009. This version had been named \"Larry the Bird\" after Larry Bird of the NBA's Boston Celtics fame.[325][326]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe service is also used as a form of civil disobedience: In 2010, users expressed outrage over the Twitter joke trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the film *Spartacus* (1960) and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they canceled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.[507] Another case of civil disobedience happened in the 2011 British privacy injunction debate, where several celebrities who had taken out anonymized injunctions were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored.[508]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of mid-April, Twitter no longer allows searching tweets without an account.[145][146] On June 30, 2023, Twitter blocked unregistered users from viewing tweets or profiles on the platform. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwitter is used to make TV more interactive, with such use growing in popularity around 2011.[640] This effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen, \"virtual watercooler\" or social television—the practice has been called \"chatterboxing\".[641] Twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live TV events, such as the Oscars, the Super Bowl[642] and the MTV Video Music Awards; however, this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled TV shows.[643] Such direct cross-promotions have been banned from French television due to regulations against secret advertising.[644]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2023 the program was updated for notes to appear faster on the platform, described as a \"massive speed improvement\" by X, as well as scaled to send notifications to users who had interacted with the posts.[628] Elon Musk further announced that posts \"corrected\" by *Community Notes* would no longer be eligible for ad revenue in order to \"maximize the incentive for accuracy over sensationalism\" and in order to discourage the spread of misinformation and disinformation on the platform.

Reilly and Robinson Meyer, Twitter has an outsized impact on the public discourse and media. \"Something happens on Twitter; celebrities, politicians and journalists talk about it, and it's circulated to a wider audience by Twitter's algorithms; journalists write about the dustup.\" This can lead to an argument on a Twitter feed looking like a \"debate roiling the country... regular people are left with a confused, agitated view of our current political discourse\".[559] In a 2018 article in the *Columbia Journalism Review*, Matthew Ingram argued much the same about Twitter's \"oversized role\" and that it promotes immediacy over newsworthiness.[560] In some cases, inauthentic and provocative tweets were taken up as common opinion in mainstream articles. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom Spring 2007 to 2008, the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling.[361] Since 2009, implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala.[362] The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200 to 300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.[71]\n\n\nAs of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed that they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack to a Java server they call Blender.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Appearance and features[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Twitter features\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include only a **brief** summary of List of Twitter features.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this article's main text. *(November 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Posts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwitter banned 7,000 accounts and limited 150,000 more that had ties to QAnon on July 21, 2020. The bans and limits came after QAnon-related accounts began harassing other users through practices of swarming or brigading, coordinated attacks on these individuals through multiple accounts in the weeks prior. Those accounts limited by Twitter will not appear in searches nor be promoted in other Twitter functions. Twitter said they will continue to ban or limit accounts as necessary, with their support account stating \"We will permanently suspend accounts Tweeting about these topics that we know are engaged in violations of our multi-account policy, coordinating abuse around individual victims, or are attempting to evade a previous suspension\".[477]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis ultimately promotes growth and learning among students and educators, not just in the classroom, but virtually and around the world.\n\n\n\n#### Public figures[edit]\n\n\nJonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that \"the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful.\"[548] In that same vein, and with Sigmund Freud in mind, political communications expert Matthew Auer observed that well-crafted tweets by public figures often deliberately mix trivial and serious information so as to appeal to all three parts of the reader's personality: the id, ego, and superego.[549]\n\n\nThe poets Mira Gonzalez and Tao Lin published a book titled *Selected Tweets* featuring selections of their tweets over some eight years.

The payment scheme's upper limit amounts to an annual fee of up to $2.5 million for top-tier access. With the paywall implementation, public agencies issued numerous alerts about potential interruptions to transit and weather alerts. Shanifah Rieara, MTA Acting Chief Customer Officer, revealed that Twitter attempted to demand over $500,000 annually from MTA for platform access, which the latter declined.\nOn May 4, 2023, Twitter backtracked its paywall system, allowing the free posting of automated tweets by verified government profiles. In light of Twitter's decision, MTA announced its resumption of posting automated alerts on the platform.[534]\n\n\n\n#### Emergency use[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nX's origins lie in a \"daylong brainstorming session\" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.[44][45] The original project code name for the service was *twttr*, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[46] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to *Twitter*.[47] The developers initially considered \"10958\" as the service's short code for SMS text messaging, but later changed it to \"40404\" for \"ease of use and memorability\".[48] Work on the project started in February 2006.[49] Dorsey published the first Twitter message on March 21, 2006, at 12:50 p.m. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe verification marker was included in a premium tier of Twitter Blue introduced on November 9, 2022, priced at US$7.99.[277] On November 11, 2022, after the introduction of this feature led to prominent issues involving accounts using the feature to impersonate public figures and companies, Twitter Blue with verification was temporarily suspended.[278][279] After about a month, Twitter Blue was relaunched on December 12, 2022, though for those purchasing the service through the iOS app store, the cost will be $10.99 a month as to offset the 30% revenue split that Apple takes.[280]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASA astronaut T. J. Creamer on January 22, 2010.[73] By late November 2010, an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts' communal account, @NASA\\_Astronauts. NASA has also hosted over 25 \"tweetups\", events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants' social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA.\n\n\nTwitter acquired application developer Atebits on April 11, 2010.

Users are also three times as likely to be younger than 50 years old, with the median age of adult U.S. users being 40 years old. The survey found that 10% of users who are most active on Twitter are responsible for 80% of all tweets, focusing mainly on the topics of politics and women.[315]\n\n\n\n### Content[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Content of tweets according to Pear Analytics in August 2009 News (3.6%)\n Spam (3.8%)\n Self-promotion (5.9%)\n Pointless babble (40.1%)\n Conversational (37.6%)\n Pass-along value (8.7%)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome major brands including Dyson, Mazda, Forbes, and PBS Kids suspended their marketing campaigns and pulled their ads from the platform, after an investigation into child porn on twitter showed that Twitter failed to suspend 70% of the accounts that shared or solicited the prohibited content. A brand president at Cole Haan said, \"We're horrified ... either Twitter is going to fix this, or we'll fix it by any means we can, which includes not buying Twitter ads.\"[530]\n\n\n\n### Impact[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long and excessively detailed.** Please consider summarizing the material. *(May 2022)*\n |\n\n\n#### On communication[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2022, billionaire Elon Musk acquired Twitter for US$44 billion, gaining control of the platform and becoming CEO.[24][25][26][27] Since the acquisition, the platform has been criticized for the spread of misinformation and disinformation,[28][29][30] facilitating an increase in hate speech,[31][32][33] promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories[34][35] and transphobia.[36][37]\n\n\nLinda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as Chairman and CTO.[10][38][39] In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to X and that the bird logo would be retired.[40][41] In October 2023, the company estimated its value at about $19 billion, down about 55% from the purchase price one year earlier.[42] Fidelity at about the same time estimated the value to be down 65% from its purchase price.[43]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Twitter\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn September 7, 2011, Twitter announced that it had 100 million active users logging in at least once a month and 50 million active users every day.[307] On March 31, 2014, Twitter announced that there were 255 million monthly active users (MAUs) and 198 million mobile MAUs.[308] In 2013, there were over 100 million users actively using Twitter daily and about 500 million tweets every day,[309] with about 29% of users checking Twitter multiple times a day.[310]\nAs of Q1 2019[update], Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. The majority of Twitter users skew to the American political left.[311][312][18]\n\n\nIn 2012, the country with the most active users on Twitter was the United States.[313] A 2016 Pew research poll found that Twitter is used by 24% of all online US adults. It was equally popular with men and women (24% and 25% of online Americans respectively), but more popular with younger (36% of 18–29 year olds) generations.[314]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to research published in April 2014, around 44% of user accounts have never tweeted.[319] About 22% of Americans say they have ever used Twitter, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey.[320] In 2009, Nielsen Online reported that Twitter had a user-retention rate of forty percent. Many people stop using the service after a month; therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all Internet users.[321] Noting how demographics of Twitter users differ from the average Americans, commentators have cautioned against media narratives that treat Twitter as representative of the population,[322] adding that only 10% of users Tweet actively, and that 90% of Twitter users have Tweeted no more than twice. In 2016, shareholders sued Twitter, alleging it \"artificially inflated its stock price by misleading them about user engagement\". The company announced on September 20, 2021, that it would pay $809.5 million to settle this class-action lawsuit.[323]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n436. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Twitter now lets businesses handle their employees' blue ticks, for a hefty price\". *Mashable*.

On launch, the concept was limited to NBCUniversal channels and Xfinity cable television subscribers.[651] A year later, Twitter acquired SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph, and partnered with research company Kantar (which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013), which strengthened Twitter's dominance of the \"second screen\" – TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Malicious and fake accounts[edit]\n\n\nBetween January and late July 2017, Twitter had identified and shut down over 7,000 fake accounts created by Iranian influence operations.[495]\n\n\nIn May 2018, in response to scrutiny over the misuse of Twitter by those seeking to maliciously influence elections, Twitter announced that it would partner with the nonprofit organization Ballotpedia to add special labels verifying the authenticity of political candidates running for election in the U.S.[496][497]\n\n\nIn December 2019, Twitter removed 5,929 accounts for violating their manipulation policies. The company investigated and attributed these accounts to a single state-run information operation, which originated in Saudi Arabia. The accounts were reported to be a part of a larger group of 88,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior. However, Twitter did not disclose all of them as some could possibly be legitimate accounts taken over through hacking.[498]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2023, the gold checkmark was made available for organizations to purchase through the Verified Organizations program (formerly called Twitter Blue for Business).[436][437]\n\n\n\n### Privacy[edit]\n\n\nTweets are public, but users can also send private \"direct messages\".[438] Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public, though accounts can be changed to \"protected\" which limits this information (and all tweets) to approved followers.[439] Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its privacy policy. The service also reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands.[440] Advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads[441] directed specifically to the user.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2015, following updated terms of service and privacy policy, Twitter users outside the United States were legally served by the Ireland-based Twitter International Company instead of Twitter, Inc. The change made these users subject to Irish and European Union data protection laws[455]\n\n\nOn April 8, 2020, Twitter announced that users outside of the European Economic Area or United Kingdom (thus subject to GDPR) will no longer be allowed to opt out of sharing \"mobile app advertising measurements\" to Twitter third-party partners.[456]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn July 15, 2020, a major hack of Twitter affected 130 high-profile accounts, both verified and unverified ones such as Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk; the hack allowed bitcoin scammers to send tweets via the compromised accounts that asked the followers to send bitcoin to a given public address, with the promise to double their money.[404] Within a few hours, Twitter disabled tweeting and reset passwords from all verified accounts.[404] Analysis of the event revealed that the scammers had used social engineering to obtain credentials from Twitter employees to access an administration tool used by Twitter to view and change these accounts' personal details as to gain access as part of a \"smash and grab\" attempt to make money quickly, with an estimated US$120,000 in bitcoin deposited in various accounts before Twitter intervened.[405] Several law enforcement entities including the FBI launched investigations into the attack.[406]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late 2009, the \"Twitter Lists\" feature was added, making it possible for users to follow a curated list of accounts all at once, rather than following individual users.[180][246] Currently, lists can be set to either public or private. Public lists may be recommended to users via the general Lists interface and appear in search results.[247] If a users follows a public list, it will appear in the \"View Lists\" section of their profile, so that other users may quickly find it and follow it as well.[248] Private lists can only be followed if the creator shares a specific link to their list. Lists add a separate tab to the Twitter interface with the title of the list, such as \"News\" or \"Economics\".\n\n\n\n#### Moments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWithin a year, the Larry the Bird logo underwent a redesign by Stone and Pascuzzo to eliminate the cartoon features, leaving a solid silhouette of Larry the Bird that was used from 2010 through 2012.[325] In 2012, Douglas Bowman created a further simplified version of Larry the Bird, keeping the solid silhouette but making it more similar to a mountain bluebird.[327] This logo was simply called the \"Twitter Bird\" and was used until July 2023.[325][328][329]\n\n\n\n![The official X profile.](image)The official X profile, on the site, as of August 2023.\nOn July 22, 2023, Elon Musk announced that the service would be re-branded to \"X\",[330] in his pursuit of creating an \"everything app\".[329] Musk's X profile picture, along with the official X accounts, and the icons when browsing/signing up for the platform, were updated to reflect the new logo.[331] The logo (𝕏) is a Unicode mathematical alphanumeric symbol for the letter \"X\" styled in double-strike bold.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs part of its efforts to monetize porn, Twitter held an internal investigation that reported in April 2022, \"Twitter cannot accurately detect child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity at scale.\"[527]\n\n\nJohn Doe et al. vs. Twitter, a civil lawsuit filed in the 9th Circuit Court, alleges that Twitter benefited from sex trafficking and refused to remove the illegal tweets when first informed of them.[528][529] In an amicus brief filed in the case, the NCMEC said, \"The children informed the company that they were minors, that they had been 'baited, harassed, and threatened' into making the videos, that they were victims of 'sex abuse' under investigation by law enforcement\" but Twitter failed to remove the videos, \"allowing them to be viewed by hundreds of thousands of the platform's users\".[527]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTwitter is banned completely in Russia,[569] Iran, China and North Korea,[570] and has been intermittently blocked in numerous countries including Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, Turkey, Venezuela and Turkmenistan on different bases.[571][572][573][574][575][576] In 2016, Twitter cooperated with the Israeli government to remove certain content originating outside Israel from tweets seen in Israel.[577] In the 11th biannual transparency report published on September 19, 2017, Twitter said that Turkey was the first among countries where about 90 percent of removal requests came from, followed by Russia, France and Germany.[578] Twitter stated that between July 1 and December 31, 2018, \"We received legal demands relating to 27,283 accounts from 47 different countries, including Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, and Slovenia for the first time.\"[579] As part of evidence to a U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, Twitter began to place a larger focus on live streaming video programming, hosting various events including streams of the Republican and Democratic conventions during the U.S. presidential campaign as part of a partnership with CBS News,[222] Dreamhack and ESL esports events,[223] and winning a bid for non-exclusive streaming rights to ten NFL *Thursday Night Football* games in the 2016 season.[223][224]\n\n\nDuring an event in New York in May 2017, Twitter announced that it planned to construct a 24-hour streaming video channel hosted within the service, featuring content from various partners.[223][225] CEO Jack Dorsey stated that the digital video strategy was part of a goal for Twitter to be \"the first place that anyone hears of anything going on that matters to them\"; as of the first quarter of 2017[update], Twitter had over 200 content partners, who streamed over 800 hours of video over 450 events.[226]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 28, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. Musk promptly fired several top executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal.\n\n#### Post-acquisition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Twitter under Elon Musk\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | It has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled *Twitter\\_under\\_Elon\\_Musk#Post-acquisition*.

He later tweeted that if he found a logo, the rebrand would be implemented the next day. Subsequently, he tweeted a video of the Twitter logo glitching into an abstract X logo.[161]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn August 5, 2022, Twitter disclosed that a bug introduced in a June 2021 update to the service allowed threat actors to link email addresses and phone numbers to twitter user's accounts.[407][408] The bug was reported through Twitter's bug bounty program in January 2022 and subsequently fixed. While Twitter originally believed no one had taken advantage of the vulnerability, it was later revealed that a user on the online hacking forum Breached Forums had used the vulnerability to compile a list of over 5.4 million user profiles, which they offered to sell for $30,000.[409][410] The information compiled by the hacker includes user's screen names, location and email addresses which could be utilised in phishing attacks or used to deanonymize accounts running under pseudonyms.\n\n\n\n### Outages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n286. **^** Hatmaker, Taylor (September 1, 2021). \"Twitter rolls out paid subscription 'Super Follows' to let you cash in on your tweets\".

This was brought on by Twitter's failure to comply with the new IT rules introduced in 2021 with a filing stating that the company failed to appoint executives to govern user content on the platform.[522] Twitter stated to India's government in August 2021 that they have appointed permanent executives and staff to provide for compliance to these new IT rules.[523]\n\n\n\n#### Pornography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Arab Spring in early 2011, the number of hashtags mentioning the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt increased.[509] A study by the Dubai School of Government found that only 0.26% of the Egyptian population, 0.1% of the Tunisian population and 0.04% of the Syrian population are active on Twitter.[510]\n\n\n\n#### Governments[edit]\n\n\nAccording to documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published in July 2014, the United Kingdom's GCHQ has a tool named BIRDSONG for \"automated posting of Twitter updates\", and a tool named BIRDSTRIKE for \"Twitter monitoring and profile collection\".[511][512]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most tweeted moment in the history of Twitter occurred on August 2, 2013; during a Japanese television airing of the Studio Ghibli film *Castle in the Sky*, fans simultaneously tweeted the word *balse* (バルス)—the incantation for a destruction spell used during its climax, after it was uttered in the film.

Twitterrific's Sean Heber confirmed in a blog post that the 16-year-old app has been discontinued. \"We are sorry to say that the app's sudden and undignified demise is due to an unannounced and undocumented policy change by an increasingly capricious Twitter – a Twitter that we no longer recognize as trustworthy nor want to work with any longer.\"[377]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Twitter announced it would be ending free access to Twitter API, and began offering paid tier plans with a more limited access.[378]\n\n\n\n### Innovators patent agreement[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2011, Twitter announced that it would offer small businesses a self-service advertising system.[339] The self-service advertising platform was launched in March 2012 to American Express card members and merchants in the U.S. on an invite-only basis.[340] To continue their advertising campaign, Twitter announced on March 20, 2012, that promoted tweets would be introduced to mobile devices.[341] In April 2013, Twitter announced that its Twitter Ads self-service platform, consisting of promoted tweets and promoted accounts, was available to all U.S. users without an invite.[340]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2016, Twitter launched Instant Unlock Card, a new feature that encourages people to tweet about a brand in order to earn rewards and utilize the social media network's conversational ads.

The files describe internal discussion as related to Twitter's moderation steps in events such as the breaking of the Hunter Biden laptop controversy, shadow banning of some conservative commentators' accounts, and the decision to block Trump. While some on the right saw the documents as evidence of Twitter's liberal bias and hostility to free speech, many people on the left described them as a reflection of how difficult it is for social media platforms to make tough decisions about content moderation.[126][127][128]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe counters for \"likes\", \"reposts\", and replies appear next to the respective buttons in timelines such as on profile pages and search results. Counters for likes and reposts exist on a post’s standalone page too. Since September 2020, quote tweets, formerly known as \"retweet with comment\", have their own counter on their post page.[182] Until the legacy desktop front end that was discontinued in 2020, a row with miniature profile pictures of up to ten liking or retweeting users was displayed (earliest documented implementation in December 2011 overhaul), as well as a tweet reply counter next to the according button on a tweet's page.[185][186]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2008, *The Wall Street Journal* wrote that social networking services such as Twitter \"elicit mixed feelings in the technology-savvy people who have been their early adopters.

The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous retweet record within forty minutes, and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour.[662][663][664] By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times.[662] On May 9, 2017, Ellen's record was broken by Carter Wilkerson (@carterjwm) by collecting nearly 3.5 million retweets in a little over a month.[665] This record was broken when Yusaku Maezawa announced a giveaway on Twitter in January 2019, accumulating 4.4 million retweets. A similar tweet he made in December 2019 was retweeted 3.8 million times.[666]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.[55] \"The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,\" remarked *Newsweek*'s Steven Levy. \"Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\"[56] Reaction at the conference was highly positive.[57] Twitter staff received the festival's Web Award prize with the remark \"we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!\"[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 2006 until 2010, Twitter's developer platform experienced strong growth and a highly favorable reputation. Developers built upon the public API to create the first Twitter mobile phone clients as well as the first URL shortener. Between 2010 and 2012, however, Twitter made a number of decisions that were received unfavorably by the developer community.[368] In 2010, Twitter mandated that all developers adopt OAuth authentication with just 9 weeks of notice.[369] Later that year, Twitter launched its own URL shortener, in direct competition with some of its most well-known third-party developers.[370] And in 2012, Twitter introduced stricter usage limits for its API, \"completely crippling\" some developers.[371][372] While these moves successfully increased the stability and security of the service, they were broadly perceived as hostile to developers, causing them to lose trust in the platform.[373]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy September 2022, the program had expanded to 15,000 users.[622] In October 2022 *The Verge* found that the most commonly published notes were related to COVID-19 misinformation based on historical useage.[623] In November 2022, at the request of new owner Elon Musk, Birdwatch was rebranded to *Community Notes,* taking an open-source approach to deal with misinformation,[624] and expanded to Europe and countries outside of the US.[158][600][604] In May 2023, Community Notes was extended to include notes on misleading images[625] and in September 2023 further extended to videos, but only for a group of power-users referred to as \"Top Writers\".[626] Twitter subsequently ended the ability to report misleading posts, instead relying exclusively on Community Notes,[627] with contributors proposing over 21,200 notes on the platform.[616]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n539. **^** Grandjean, Martin (2016). \"A social network analysis of Twitter: Mapping the digital humanities community\". *Cogent Arts & Humanities*. **3** (1): 1171458. doi:10.1080/23311983.2016.1171458.

Twitter had intended for fleets to encourage more users to tweet regularly, rather than simply consume other users' tweets, but instead fleets were generally used by users who already tweeted a lot. The company stated that their spot at the top of the screen would now be occupied by currently active Spaces from the user's feed.[240]\n\n\n\n### Curation[edit]\n\n\n#### Trending topics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Twitter trends\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs per a research study conducted by IT for Change on abuse and misogynistic trolling on Twitter directed at Indian women in public-political life, women perceived to be ideologically left-leaning, dissenters, Muslim women, political dissenters, and political commentators and women from opposition parties received a disproportionate amount of abusive and hateful messages on Twitter.[471]\n\n\nIn 2016, Twitter announced the creation of the Twitter Trust & Safety Council to help \"ensure that people feel safe expressing themselves on Twitter\". The council's inaugural members included 50 organizations and individuals.[472] The announcement of Twitter's \"Trust & Safety Council\" was met with objection from parts of its userbase.[473][474] Critics accused the member organizations of being heavily skewed towards \"the restriction of hate speech\" and a *Reason* article expressed concern that \"there's not a single uncompromising anti-censorship figure or group on the list\".[475][476]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement an \"Innovators Patent Agreement\" which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents for defensive purposes.[*clarify*][379]\n\n\n\n### Open source[edit]\n\n\nTwitter has a history of both using and releasing open-source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service.[380] A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open-source projects which they have used, from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala.[381] Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side package manager.[382] The popular Bootstrap frontend framework was also started at Twitter and is 10th most popular repository on GitHub.[383]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n199. **^** Kutty, Darpana (October 15, 2009). \"Twitter, Bharti Airtel Tie-Up To Activate Twitter SMS Service in India\". *topnews.in*.

Eligible users of Ticketed Spaces and Super Follows will be able to receive their earnings in the form of USD coin, a stablecoin whose value is that of the U.S. dollar. Users can also hold their earnings in crypto wallets, and then exchange them into other cryptocurrencies.[292]\n\n\n\n### E-commerce[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, Twitter offered a \"Buy button\" feature, allowing tweets to embed products that could be purchased from within the service.

Twitter initially intended the feature to be used by its in-house editorial team and other partners; they populated a dedicated tab in Twitter's apps, chronicling news headlines, sporting events, and other content.[249][250] In September 2016, creation of moments became available to all Twitter users.[251]\n\n\n\n### Algorithm[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwitter relies on open-source software.[358] The Twitter Web interface uses the Ruby on Rails framework,[359] deployed on a performance enhanced Ruby Enterprise Edition implementation of Ruby.[360][*needs update*]\n\n\nIn the early days of Twitter, tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally sharded (large databases were split based on time of posting). After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.[71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn August 2013, Twitter announced plans to introduce a \"report abuse\" button for all versions of the site following uproar, including a petition with 100,000 signatures, over Tweets that included rape and death threats to historian Mary Beard, feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and the member of parliament Stella Creasy.[460][461][462] Twitter announced new reporting and blocking policies in December 2014,[463][464][465][466] including a blocking mechanism devised by Randi Harper, a target of GamerGate.[467][468][469] In February 2015, CEO Dick Costolo said he was 'frankly ashamed' at how poorly Twitter handled trolling and abuse, and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result.[470]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwitter allows users to update their profile via their mobile phones either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets.[187] Twitter has been compared to a web-based Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client.[188] In a 2009 *Time* magazine essay, technology author Steven Johnson described the basic mechanics of Twitter as \"remarkably simple\":\n\n\n\n\n> As a social network, Twitter revolves around the principle of followers. When you choose to follow another Twitter user, that user's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page.

The original logo, which was simply the word *Twitter*, was in use from its launch in March 2006. It was accompanied by an image of a bird which was later discovered to be a piece of clip art created by the British graphic designer Simon Oxley.[325] A new logo had to be redesigned by founder Biz Stone with help from designer Philip Pascuzzo, which resulted in a more cartoon-like bird in 2009. This version had been named \"Larry the Bird\" after Larry Bird of the NBA's Boston Celtics fame.[325][326]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe service is also used as a form of civil disobedience: In 2010, users expressed outrage over the Twitter joke trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the film *Spartacus* (1960) and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they canceled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.[507] Another case of civil disobedience happened in the 2011 British privacy injunction debate, where several celebrities who had taken out anonymized injunctions were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored.[508]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of mid-April, Twitter no longer allows searching tweets without an account.[145][146] On June 30, 2023, Twitter blocked unregistered users from viewing tweets or profiles on the platform. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwitter is used to make TV more interactive, with such use growing in popularity around 2011.[640] This effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen, \"virtual watercooler\" or social television—the practice has been called \"chatterboxing\".[641] Twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live TV events, such as the Oscars, the Super Bowl[642] and the MTV Video Music Awards; however, this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled TV shows.[643] Such direct cross-promotions have been banned from French television due to regulations against secret advertising.[644]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2023 the program was updated for notes to appear faster on the platform, described as a \"massive speed improvement\" by X, as well as scaled to send notifications to users who had interacted with the posts.[628] Elon Musk further announced that posts \"corrected\" by *Community Notes* would no longer be eligible for ad revenue in order to \"maximize the incentive for accuracy over sensationalism\" and in order to discourage the spread of misinformation and disinformation on the platform.

(Discuss) *(November 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### 2006–2007: Creation and initial reaction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMany commentators have suggested that Twitter radically changed the format of reporting due to instant, short, and frequent communication.[557][558] According to *The Atlantic* writers Benjamin M. Reilly and Robinson Meyer, Twitter has an outsized impact on the public discourse and media. \"Something happens on Twitter; celebrities, politicians and journalists talk about it, and it's circulated to a wider audience by Twitter's algorithms; journalists write about the dustup.\" This can lead to an argument on a Twitter feed looking like a \"debate roiling the country... regular people are left with a confused, agitated view of our current political discourse\".[559] In a 2018 article in the *Columbia Journalism Review*, Matthew Ingram argued much the same about Twitter's \"oversized role\" and that it promotes immediacy over newsworthiness.[560] In some cases, inauthentic and provocative tweets were taken up as common opinion in mainstream articles. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom Spring 2007 to 2008, the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling.[361] Since 2009, implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala.[362] The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200 to 300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.[71]\n\n\nAs of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed that they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack to a Java server they call Blender.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Appearance and features[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Twitter features\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include only a **brief** summary of List of Twitter features.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this article's main text. *(November 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Posts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwitter banned 7,000 accounts and limited 150,000 more that had ties to QAnon on July 21, 2020. The bans and limits came after QAnon-related accounts began harassing other users through practices of swarming or brigading, coordinated attacks on these individuals through multiple accounts in the weeks prior. Those accounts limited by Twitter will not appear in searches nor be promoted in other Twitter functions. Twitter said they will continue to ban or limit accounts as necessary, with their support account stating \"We will permanently suspend accounts Tweeting about these topics that we know are engaged in violations of our multi-account policy, coordinating abuse around individual victims, or are attempting to evade a previous suspension\".[477]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis ultimately promotes growth and learning among students and educators, not just in the classroom, but virtually and around the world.\n\n\n\n#### Public figures[edit]\n\n\nJonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that \"the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful.\"[548] In that same vein, and with Sigmund Freud in mind, political communications expert Matthew Auer observed that well-crafted tweets by public figures often deliberately mix trivial and serious information so as to appeal to all three parts of the reader's personality: the id, ego, and superego.[549]\n\n\nThe poets Mira Gonzalez and Tao Lin published a book titled *Selected Tweets* featuring selections of their tweets over some eight years.

The payment scheme's upper limit amounts to an annual fee of up to $2.5 million for top-tier access. With the paywall implementation, public agencies issued numerous alerts about potential interruptions to transit and weather alerts. Shanifah Rieara, MTA Acting Chief Customer Officer, revealed that Twitter attempted to demand over $500,000 annually from MTA for platform access, which the latter declined.\nOn May 4, 2023, Twitter backtracked its paywall system, allowing the free posting of automated tweets by verified government profiles. In light of Twitter's decision, MTA announced its resumption of posting automated alerts on the platform.[534]\n\n\n\n#### Emergency use[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nX's origins lie in a \"daylong brainstorming session\" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.[44][45] The original project code name for the service was *twttr*, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[46] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to *Twitter*.[47] The developers initially considered \"10958\" as the service's short code for SMS text messaging, but later changed it to \"40404\" for \"ease of use and memorability\".[48] Work on the project started in February 2006.[49] Dorsey published the first Twitter message on March 21, 2006, at 12:50 p.m. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe verification marker was included in a premium tier of Twitter Blue introduced on November 9, 2022, priced at US$7.99.[277] On November 11, 2022, after the introduction of this feature led to prominent issues involving accounts using the feature to impersonate public figures and companies, Twitter Blue with verification was temporarily suspended.[278][279] After about a month, Twitter Blue was relaunched on December 12, 2022, though for those purchasing the service through the iOS app store, the cost will be $10.99 a month as to offset the 30% revenue split that Apple takes.[280]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASA astronaut T. J. Creamer on January 22, 2010.[73] By late November 2010, an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts' communal account, @NASA\\_Astronauts. NASA has also hosted over 25 \"tweetups\", events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants' social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA.\n\n\nTwitter acquired application developer Atebits on April 11, 2010. Atebits had developed the Apple Design Award-winning Twitter client Tweetie for the Mac and iPhone.
