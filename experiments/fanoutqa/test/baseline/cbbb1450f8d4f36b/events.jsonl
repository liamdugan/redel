By sales, it was the largest automaker in the United States in 2022, and was the largest in the world for 77 years before losing the top spot to Toyota in 2008.[4][5]\n\n\nGeneral Motors operates manufacturing plants in eight countries.[6] In addition to its four core brands, GM also holds interests in Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling via SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile.[2] GM further owns the BrightDrop delivery vehicle manufacturer,[7] a namesake defense vehicles division which produces military vehicles for the United States government and military,[8] the vehicle safety, security, and information services provider OnStar,[9] the auto parts company ACDelco, a namesake financial lending service, and majority ownership in the self-driving cars enterprise Cruise LLC.\n\n\nThe company traces itself to a holding company for Buick established on September 16, 1908, by William C. Durant, the largest seller of horse-drawn vehicles at the time. The first half of the 20th century saw the company grow into an automotive behemoth through acquisitions; going into the second half, the company pursued innovation and new offerings to consumers as well as collaborations with NASA to develop the earliest electric vehicles.[10][11] The current entity was established in 2009 after the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.[12]\n\n\nToday, General Motors remains a successful company, ranking 25th by total revenue out of all American companies on the *Fortune 500* and 50th on the *Fortune Global 500*.[13][14] The company is presently heavily pursuing electric vehicles, as GM announced plans in January 2021 to end production and sales of vehicles using internal combustion engines, including hybrid vehicles and plug-in hybrids, by 2035, as part of its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of General Motors\n\n### Founding and consolidation[edit]\n\n\nBy 1900, William C. Durant's Durant-Dort Carriage Company of Flint, Michigan had become the largest manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles in the United States.[16] Durant was averse to automobiles, but fellow Flint businessman James H. Whiting, owner of Flint Wagon Works, sold him the Buick Motor Company in 1904.[17] Durant formed the General Motors Company in 1908 as a holding company, with partner Charles Stewart Mott, borrowing a naming convention from General Electric.[18] GM's first acquisition was Buick, which Durant already owned, then Olds Motor Works on November 12, 1908.[19] Under Durant, GM went on to acquire Cadillac, Elmore, Welch, Cartercar, Oakland (the predecessor of Pontiac), the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of Pontiac, Michigan, and the Reliance Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan (predecessors of GMC) in 1909.\n\n\nDurant, with the board's approval, also tried acquiring Ford Motor Company, but needed an additional $2 million.[20] Durant over-leveraged GM in making acquisitions, and was removed by the board of directors in 1910 at the order of the bankers who backed the loans to keep GM in business.[17] The action of the bankers was partially influenced by the Panic of 1910–1911 that followed the earlier enforcement of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering of Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO) and Henry M. Leland invented and patented the first electric starter in America.[21] In November 1911, Durant co-founded Chevrolet with Swiss race car driver Louis Chevrolet, who left the company in 1915 after a disagreement with Durant.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Motors Company share certificate issued October 13, 1916\nGM was reincorporated in Detroit in 1916 as General Motors Corporation and became a public company via an initial public offering. By 1917, Chevrolet had become successful enough that Durant, with the backing of Samuel McLaughlin and Pierre S. du Pont, reacquired a controlling interest in GM. The same year, GM acquired Samson Tractor.[23] Chevrolet Motor Company was consolidated into GM on May 2, 1918, and the same year GM acquired United Motors, a parts supplier founded by Durant and headed by Alfred P. Sloan for $45 million, and the McLaughlin Motor Car Company, founded by R. S. McLaughlin, became General Motors of Canada Limited.[24][25][26] In 1919, GM acquired Guardian Frigerator Company, part-owned by Durant, which was renamed Frigidaire. Also in 1919, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), which provides financing to automotive customers, was formed.[27][17]\n\n\nIn 1920, du Pont orchestrated the removal of Durant once again and replaced him with Alfred P. Sloan.[28] At a time when GM was competing heavily with Ford Motor Company, Sloan established annual model changes, making previous years' models \"dated\" and created a market for used cars.[29] He also implemented the pricing strategy used by car companies today. The pricing strategy had Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac priced from least expensive to most, respectively.[30][*page needed*]\n\n\nIn 1921, Thomas Midgley Jr., an engineer for GM, discovered tetraethyllead (leaded gasoline) as an antiknock agent, and GM patented the compound because ethanol could not be patented.[31] This led to the development of higher compression engines resulting in more power and efficiency. The public later realized that lead contained in the gasoline was harmful to various biological organisms including humans.[32] Evidence shows that corporate executives understood the health implications of tetraethyllead from the beginning.[33] As an engineer for GM, Midgley also developed chlorofluorocarbons, which have now been banned due to their contribution to climate change.[34]\n\n\nUnder the encouragement of GM President Alfred P. Sloan Jr., GM acquired Vauxhall Motors for $2.5 million in 1925.[35] The company also acquired an interest in the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company the same year, and its president, John D. Hertz, joined the board of directors of GM; it acquired the remainder of the company in 1943.[17]\n\n\n\n### Growth and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1926, the company introduced the Pontiac brand and established the General Motors Group Insurance Program to provide life insurance to its employees.[17] The following year, after the success of the 1927 model of the Cadillac LaSalle designed by Harley Earl, Sloan created the \"Art and Color Section\" of GM and named Earl as its first director. Earl was the first design executive to be appointed to leadership at a major American corporation. Earl created a system of automobile design that is still practiced today.[36] At the age of 24, Bill Mitchell was recruited by Harley Earl to the design team at GM, and he was later appointed as Chief Designer of Cadillac. After Earl retired in December 1958, Mitchell took over automotive design for GM.[37] Also in 1926 the company acquired Fisher Body, its supplier of automobile bodies.[38]\n\n\nGM acquired Allison Engine Company[17][39] and began developing a 1,000 horsepower liquid-cooled aircraft engine in 1929.[17] The same year, GM acquired 80% of Opel, which at that time had a 37.5% market share in Europe, for $26 million. It acquired the remaining 20% in 1931.[35]\n\n\nIn the late-1920s, Charles Kettering embarked on a program to develop a lightweight two-stroke diesel engine for possible usage in automobiles.[40] Soon after, GM acquired Electro-Motive Company and the Winton Engine Co., and in 1941, it expanded EMC's realm to locomotive engine manufacturing.[41]\n\n\nIn 1932, GM acquired Packard Electric[17][42] (not the Packard car company, which merged with Studebaker years later). The following year, GM acquired a controlling interest in North American Aviation and merged it with the General Aviation Manufacturing Corporation.[43]\n\n\nThe GM labor force participated in the formation of the United Auto Workers labor union in 1935, and in 1936 the UAW organized the Flint Sit-Down Strike, which initially idled two key plants in Flint, Michigan, and later spread to 6 other plants including those in Janesville, Wisconsin and Fort Wayne, Indiana. In Flint, police attempted to enter the plant to arrest strikers, leading to violence; in other cities, the plants were shuttered peacefully. The strike was resolved on February 11, 1937, when GM recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for its workers and gave workers a 5% raise and permission to speak in the lunchroom.[44]\n\n\nWalter E. Jominy and A.L. Boegehold of GM invented the Jominy end-quench test for hardenability of carbon steel in 1937, a breakthrough in heat treating still in use today as ASTM A255.[45] GM established Detroit Diesel the next year.[46]\n\n\nIn 1939, the company founded Motors Insurance Corporation and entered the vehicle insurance market.[27] The same year, GM introduced the Hydramatic, the first affordable and successful automatic transmission, for the 1940 Oldsmobile.[47][48]\n\n\n\n* ![1926 Pontiac radiator logo](image)\n\n1926 Pontiac radiator logo\n* ![1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe](image)\n\n1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe\n\nDuring World War II, GM produced vast quantities of armaments, vehicles, and aircraft for the Allies of World War II. In 1940, GM's William S. Knudsen served as head of U.S. wartime production for President Franklin Roosevelt, and by 1942, all of GM's production was to support the war.[49] GM's Vauxhall Motors manufactured the Churchill tank series for the Allies, instrumental in the North African campaign.[17] However, its Opel division, based in Germany, supplied the Nazi Party with vehicles. Sloan, head of GM at the time, was an ardent opponent of the New Deal, which bolstered labor unions and public transport, and Sloan admired and supported Adolf Hitler.[50] Nazi armaments chief Albert Speer allegedly said in 1977 that Hitler \"would never have considered invading Poland\" without synthetic fuel technology provided by General Motors. GM was compensated $32 million by the U.S. government because its German factories were bombed by U.S. forces during the war.[51]\n\n\nEffective January 28, 1953, Charles Erwin Wilson, then GM president, was named by Dwight D. Eisenhower as United States Secretary of Defense.[17]\n\n\nIn December 1953, GM acquired Euclid Trucks, a manufacturer of heavy equipment for earthmoving, including dump trucks, loaders and wheel tractor-scrapers, which later spawned the Terex brand.[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Periods of innovation[edit]\n\n\nAlfred P. Sloan retired as chairman and was succeeded by Albert Bradley in April 1956.[54]\n\n\nIn 1962, GM introduced the first turbo charged engine in the world for a car in the Oldsmobile Cutlass Turbo-Jetfire.[17][55] Two years later, the company introduced its \"Mark of Excellence\" logo and trademark at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The company used the mark as their main corporate identifier until 2021.[56]\n\n\nGM released the Electrovan in 1966, the first hydrogen fuel cell car ever produced.[57] Though fuel cells have existed since the early 1800s, General Motors was the first to use a fuel cell, supplied by Union Carbide, to power the wheels of a vehicle with a budget of \"millions of dollars\".[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1969 Chevrolet Nova using the advertising slogan *\"Putting you first, keeps us first\"*\nIn the 1960s, GM was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of V6 engines, but quickly lost interest as the popularity of muscle cars increased. GM demonstrated gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene, an area of interest throughout the industry, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration due to the 1973 oil crisis.[61]\n\n\nIn partnership with Boeing, GM's Delco Defense Electronics Division designed the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which traversed the surface of the Moon, in 1971.[62][63] The following year, GM produced the first rear wheel anti-lock braking system for two models: the Toronado and Eldorado.[64]\n\n\nIn 1973, the Oldsmobile Toronado was the first retail car sold with a passenger airbag.[65][66]\n\n\nThomas Murphy became CEO of the company, succeeding Richard C. Gerstenberg in November 1974.[67][68]\n\n\nGM installed its first catalytic converters in its 1975 models.[69]\n\n\nFrom 1978 to 1985, GM pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies. However, it had disastrous results due to poor durability in the Oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the Cadillac V8-6-4 variable-cylinder engines.[70]\n\n\nGM sold Frigidaire in 1979. Although Frigidaire had between $450 million and $500 million in annual revenues, it was losing money.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Motors headquarters building, 1981\nRobert Lee of GM invented the Fe14Nd2B the Neodymium magnet, which was fabricated by rapid solidification, in 1984.[72] This magnet is commonly used in products like a computer hard disk. The same year, GM acquired Electronic Data Systems for $2.5 billion from Ross Perot as part of a strategy by CEO Roger Smith to derive at least 10% of its annual worldwide revenue from non-automotive sources.[73] GM also intended to have EDS handle its bookkeeping, help computerize factories, and integrate GM's computer systems. The transaction made Ross Perot the largest shareholder of GM; however, disagreements with Roger Smith led the company to buy all shares held by Ross Perot for $750 million in 1986.[74]\n\n\nIn a continuation of its diversification plans, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage in 1985. This acquisition included an $11 billion mortgage portfolio.[75] The same year, GM acquired the Hughes Aircraft Company for $5 billion in cash and stock and merged it into Delco Electronics.[76] The following year, GM acquired 59.7% of Lotus Cars, a British producer of high-performance sports cars.[77]\n\n\nIn 1987, in conjunction with AeroVironment, GM built the Sunraycer, which won the inaugural World Solar Challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by Aerovironment) and was the predecessor to the General Motors EV1.[78]\n\n\nIn 1988, GM acquired a 15% stake in AeroVironment.[79]\n\n\nIn 1989, GM acquired half of Saab Automobile's car operations for $600 million.[80]\n\n\n\n### Sales of assets[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1990, Robert Stempel became CEO of the company, succeeding Roger Smith.[81] GM cut output significantly and suffered losses that year due to the early 1990s recession.[82]\n\n\nIn 1990, GM debuted the General Motors EV1 (Impact) concept, a battery electric vehicle, at the LA Auto Show. It was the first car with zero emissions marketed in the US in over three decades. The Impact was produced as the EV1 for the 1996 model year and was available only via lease from certain dealers in California and Arizona. In 1999–2002, GM ceased production of the vehicles and started to not renew the leases, disappointing many people, allegedly because the program would not be profitable and would cannibalize its existing business. All of the EV1s were eventually returned to General Motors, and except for around 40 which were donated to museums with their electric powertrains deactivated, all were destroyed. The documentary film *Who Killed the Electric Car?* covered the EV1 story.[83]\n\n\nIn November 1992, John F. Smith Jr. became CEO of the company.[84]\n\n\nIn 1993, GM sold Lotus Cars to Bugatti.[85]\n\n\nIn 1996, in a return to its automotive basics, GM completed the corporate spin-off of Electronic Data Systems.[86][87]\n\n\nIn 1997, GM sold the military businesses of Hughes Aircraft Company to Raytheon Company for $9.5 billion in stock and the assumption of debt.[88][89][90][91]\n\n\nIn February 2000, Rick Wagoner was named CEO, succeeding John F. Smith Jr.[92][93] The next month, GM gave 5.1% of its common stock, worth $2.4 billion, to acquire a 20% share of Fiat.[94]\n\n\nIn December 2000, GM announced that it would begin phasing out Oldsmobile. The brand was eventually discontinued in 2004, seven years after it had become the first American car brand to turn 100.[95]\n\n\n\n* ![Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid vehicle](image)\n\nChevrolet Tahoe hybrid vehicle\n* ![Second generation Chevrolet Volt](image)\n\nSecond generation Chevrolet Volt\n* ![The Chevrolet Volt](image)\n\nThe Chevrolet Volt\n* ![The General Motors EV1, an electric car, was introduced in California in 1996.](image)\n\nThe General Motors EV1, an electric car, was introduced in California in 1996.\n\nIn May 2004, GM delivered the first full-sized pickup truck hybrid vehicles, the 1/2-ton Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra trucks.[96] These mild hybrids did not use electrical energy for propulsion, like GM's later designs. Later, the company debuted another hybrid technology, co-developed with DaimlerChrysler and BMW, in diesel-electric hybrid powertrain manufactured by Allison Transmission for transit buses.[97] Continuing to target the diesel-hybrid market, the Opel Astra diesel engine hybrid concept vehicle was rolled out in January 2005.[98] Later that year, GM sold its Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive division to private equity firms Berkshire Partners and Greenbriar Equity Group.[99][100]\n\n\nGM paid $2 billion to sever its ties with Fiat in 2005, severing ties with the company due to an increasingly contentious dispute.[101]\n\n\nGM began adding its \"Mark of Excellence\" emblem on all new vehicles produced and sold in North America in mid-2005. However, after the reorganization in 2009, the company no longer added the logo, saying that emphasis on its four core divisions would downplay the GM logo.[102][103]\n\n\nIn 2005, Edward T. Welburn was promoted to the newly created position of vice president, GM Global Design, making him the first African American to lead a global automotive design organization and the highest-ranking African American in the US motor industry at that time. On July 1, 2016, he retired from General Motors after 44 years. He was replaced by Michael Simcoe.[104][105]\n\n\nIn 2006, GM introduced a bright yellow fuel cap on its vehicles to remind drivers that cars can operate using E85 ethanol fuel.[106] They also introduced another hybrid vehicle that year, the Saturn Vue Green Line.[107]\n\n\nIn 2008, General Motors committed to engineering half of its manufacturing plants to be landfill-free by recycling or reusing waste in the manufacturing process.[108] Continuing their environmental-conscious development, GM started to offer the 2-mode hybrid system in the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Cadillac Escalade, and pickup trucks.[109]\n\n\nIn late 2008, the world's largest rooftop solar power installation was installed at GM's manufacturing plant in Zaragoza. The Zaragoza solar installation has about 2,000,000 square feet (190,000 m2) of roof at the plant and contains about 85,000 solar panels. The installation was created, owned and operated by Veolia Environment and Clairvoyant Energy, which leases the rooftop area from GM.[110][111][112]\n\n\n\n### Chapter 11 bankruptcy and bailout[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization\n\nIn March 2009, after the company had received $17.4 billion in bailouts but was not effective in a turnaround, President Barack Obama forced the resignation of CEO Rick Wagoner.[113]\n\n\nGeneral Motors filed for a government-backed Chapter 11 reorganization on June 8, 2009.[114][115] On July 10, 2009, the original General Motors sold assets and some subsidiaries to an entirely new company, including the trademark \"General Motors\".[114][115] Liabilities were left with the original GM, renamed Motors Liquidation Company, freeing the companies of many liabilities and resulting in a new GM.[114][115]\n\n\nThrough the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $49.5 billion in General Motors and recovered $39 billion when it sold its shares on December 9, 2013, resulting in a loss of $10.3 billion. The Treasury invested an additional $17.2 billion into GM's former financing company, GMAC (now Ally Financial). The shares in Ally were sold on December 18, 2014, for $19.6 billion netting the government $2.4 billion in profit, including dividends.[116][117] A study by the Center for Automotive Research found that the GM bailout saved 1.2 million jobs and preserved $34.9 billion in tax revenue.[118]\n\n\nGeneral Motors Canada was not part of the General Motors Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[119]\n\n\n\n### Post-reorganization[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2009, at the request of Steven Rattner, lead adviser to President Barack Obama on the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, Edward Whitacre Jr., who had led a restructuring of AT&T, was appointed as chairman of General Motors.[120] Whitacre was tasked with overseeing GM's emergence from bankruptcy and downsizing its sizable number of brand marques, many of which had produced chronic losses even before the recession began. In July 2009, after 40 days of bankruptcy protection, the company emerged from the government-backed General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.[121]\n\n\nAs mandated by its bailout agreement, GM began the process of shedding its poorest-performing brands in June 2009: Hummer, Saab, Saturn, and Pontiac. An October 2009 agreement to sell the Hummer brand to China-based Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd.[122] and a group of private investors fell through three months later, resulting in GM seeking a new suitor.[123] American company Raser Technologies, along with several others, expressed interest in buying the company, but none of the proposed acquisitions came to fruition, and in April 2010 GM said it was officially shutting down the Hummer brand.[124][125] Similarly, GM's efforts to sell its Saturn division yielded an early suitor. In June 2009, GM announced that the Saturn brand would be sold to the Penske Automotive Group.[126] The deal fell through, however, and GM declared the brand defunct in October 2010. While GM agreed to shed its underperforming Pontiac brand as part of its bailout agreement, the company explicitly opted not to sell it to another company.[127][128] The last Pontiac was built in January 2010.[129]\n\n\nGM was more successful in its attempts to sell Saab Automobile: the company closed a sale to Dutch automaker Spyker Cars in February 2010.[130] Saab continued to perform poorly under Spyker's management, however, and in 2012 the Saab division declared bankruptcy.\n\n\nIn December 2009, the \"new\" GM's board of directors asked CEO Fritz Henderson to resign, and its chairman, Ed Whitacre, was named interim CEO.[131] GM opted to appoint Whitacre as its permanent CEO the following month, though Whitacre ultimately stepped down as CEO in September 2010, relinquishing the position to fellow GM board member Daniel Akerson but agreeing to continue on as GM chairman until the end of the year. Akerson replaced him as chairman, while continuing as CEO, in January 2011.[132][133]\n\n\nIn 2010, GM introduced the Chevrolet Volt as an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), an electric vehicle with backup generators powered by gasoline, or series plug-in hybrid.[134][135] GM delivered the first Volt in December 2010.[136] The Chevrolet Volt was a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with back-up generators powered by gasoline (range-extended electric vehicle).[137] GM built a prototype two-seat electric vehicle with Segway Inc. An early prototype of the Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility vehicle—dubbed Project P.U.M.A. – was presented in New York at the 2009 New York International Auto Show.[138]\n\n\n\n* ![2nd generation Buick LaCrosse (2010–2016)[139][140]](image)\n\n2nd generation Buick LaCrosse (2010–2016)[139][140]\n* ![General Motors Sequel, a fuel cell-powered vehicle from GM.](image)\n\nGeneral Motors Sequel, a fuel cell-powered vehicle from GM.\n* ![E85 FlexFuel Chevrolet Impala LT 2009 (USA)](image)\n\nE85 FlexFuel Chevrolet Impala LT 2009 (USA)\n* ![The Chevrolet Bolt EV was released in late 2016.](image)\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV was released in late 2016.\n\nOn January 15, 2014, Mary Barra was named chief executive officer, succeeding Daniel Akerson. Barra also joined the GM board.[141] Only three weeks later, the company announced its 2014 General Motors recall, which was due to faulty ignition switches, and was linked to at least 124 deaths. The resulting settlements with family members of those killed were estimated to cost the company $1.5 billion.[142]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2016, in its first investment in a ridesharing company, GM invested $500 million in Lyft.[143][144] The company does not directly supply Lyft drivers with vehicles, however – and has no plans to do so in the future – and Lyft ultimately partnered with Motional for production of its autonomous vehicles.\n\n\nIn March 2016, GM acquired Cruise, a San Francisco self-driving vehicle start-up, to develop self-driving cars that could be used in ride-sharing fleets.[145][146] In June 2022, Cruise received California's first Driverless Deployment Permit, allowing it to both charge fees for its service as well as offer fully autonomous rides in a major public city.[147] *The Verge* reported that the company lost $561 million in Q1 2023, but said it remains on the path to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2025 and $50 billion by 2030.[148]\n\n\nIn October 2016, GM began production of the Chevrolet Bolt EV, the first-ever mass market all-electric car with a range of more than 200 miles (320 km).[149][150] The battery pack and most drivetrain components were built by LG Corporation and assembled in GM's plant in Lake Orion, Michigan.[151] GM chose to employ the Bolt EV and similar Bolt EUV for its Cruise ride-share service.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn January 8, 2021, GM introduced a new logo alongside the tagline \"EVerybody in\", with the capitalized \"EV\" as a nod to the company's commitment to electric vehicles.[152][153] GM's new logo used negative space to create the idea of an electric plug in the \"M\" of the logo.[154]\n\n\nAt the January 2021 Consumer Electronics Show, GM launched BrightDrop, its brand for all-electric commercial vehicles.[155]\n\n\nOn January 28, 2021, GM announced that it will end production and sales of fossil-fuel vehicles (including hybrids and plug-in hybrids) by 2035 as part of its plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2040.[156]\n\n\nIn 2021, GM announced plans to establish an automotive battery and battery pack laboratory in Michigan.[157][158][159] GM will be responsible for battery management systems and power electronics, thermal management, as well as the pack assembly. An existing GM facility at Brownstown Township was chosen to be upgraded as a battery pack plant.[134] LG Chem's U.S. subsidiary, Compact Power of Troy, Michigan, has been building the prototype packs for the development vehicles and will continue to provide integration support and acting as a liaison for the program.[160]\n\n\n\n### Motorsports history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chevrolet Corvette C8.R in the IMSA SportsCar Championship\nGM participated in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) from 2004 to 2012,[161] and has also participated in other motorsport championships, including 24 Hours of Le Mans,[162] NASCAR,[163] SCCA[164] and Supercars Championship.[165]\n\n\nGM's engines were successful in the Indy Racing League (IRL) throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small V8 class. GM has also done much work in the development of electronics for GM auto racing. An unmodified Aurora V8 in the Aerotech captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the Cadillac V-Series has entered motorsports racing.\n\n\nGM has also designed cars specifically for use in NASCAR auto racing. The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is the only entry in the series.[166] In the past, the Pontiac Grand Prix,[167] Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Malibu, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevrolet Impala, and the Chevrolet SS were also used. GM has won many NASCAR Cup Series manufacturer's championships, including 40 with Chevrolet,[168] the most of any make in NASCAR history, 3 with Oldsmobile, 2 with Buick, and 1 with Pontiac. In 2021, Chevrolet became the first brand to reach 800 wins.[169]\n\n\nIn Australia, Holden cars based on the Monaro, Torana and Commodore platforms raced in the Australian Touring Car Championship until 2022. Holden won the Bathurst 1000, a record 36 times between 1968 and 2022 and the Australian Touring Car Championship 23 times.[170] From 2023, the Chevrolet Camaro will be raced.[171]\n\n\n\n### Logo evolution[edit]\n\n\nEvolution of the GM logo through the years:[172]\n\n\n\n* ![1938–1964[172]](image)\n\n1938–1964[172]\n* ![Mark of Excellence (1964–2021)[172]](image)\n\nMark of Excellence (1964–2021)[172]\n* ![2001–2021[172]](image)\n\n2001–2021[172]\n* ![2010–2021[172]](image)\n\n2010–2021[172]\n* ![2021 (gradient)[172]](image)\n\n2021 (gradient)[172]\n* ![2021 (flat)[173]](image)\n\n2021 (flat)[173]\n* ![2022 (wordmark)[174]](image)\n\n2022 (wordmark)[174]\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\n### Current[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Markets served today\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) US | Buick | 1899 | 1903 | 1908 | China, North America\n |\n| ![](image) US | Cadillac | 1902 | 1902 | 1909 | North America, Middle East, China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Kazakhstan\n |\n| ![](image) US | Chevrolet | 1911 | 1911 | 1918 | Americas, China, Middle East, CIS, South Korea, Philippines, Japan, Europe, Australasia.\n |\n| ![](image) US | GMC | 1912 | 1912 | 1919 | North America, Middle East, South Korea\n |\n| ![](image) CHN | Baojun | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | China\n |\n| ![](image) CHN | Wuling | 2002 | 2002 | 2002 | China, Indonesia\n |\n\n\n### Former[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Fate\n | Defunct / Sold\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) CAN | Acadian | 1962 | 1962 | 1962 | Discontinued | 1971 | Canadian Chevy with Pontiac design accents\n |\n| ![](image) KOR | Alpheon | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | Discontinued | 2015 | The only available model was based on the Buick LaCrosse\n |\n| ![](image) CAN | Asüna | 1992 | 1992 | 1992 | Discontinued | 1994 | Composed of Suzuki, Isuzu and Toyota models.\n |\n| ![](image) CAN | Beaumont | 1966 | 1966 | 1966 | Discontinued | 1969 | Canadian Chevy with Pontiac design accents\n |\n| ![](image) UK | Bedford | 1931 | 1931 | 1931 | Discontinued | 1991 |  |\n| ![](image) US | Cartercar | 1905 | 1905 | 1909 | Discontinued | 1915 |  |\n| ![](image) KOR | Daewoo | 1972 | 1972 | 1999 | Discontinued | 2011 | Succeeded by GM Korea |\n| ![](image) US | Elmore | 1893 | 1900 | 1912 | Discontinued | 1916 |  |\n| ![](image) CAN | Envoy | 1959 | 1959 | 1959 | Discontinued | 1970 | Imported Vauxhall and Bedford vehicles sold at Canadian Chevrolet and Oldsmobile dealerships\n |\n| ![](image) CAN | Epic | 1964 | 1964 | 1964 | Discontinued | 1970 | Imported Vauxhall models sold at Canadian Pontiac, Buick and GMC dealerships\n |\n| ![](image) US | Garland |  |  | 1909 | Discontinued | 1909 |  |\n| ![](image) US | Geo | 1989 | 1989 | 1989 | Discontinued | 1997 | Composed of Suzuki, Isuzu and Toyota models.

This reign was longer than any other automaker, and GM is still among the world's largest automakers by vehicle unit sales.[176]\n\n\nIn 2008, the third-largest individual country by sales was Brazil, with some 550,000 GM vehicles sold. In that year, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela sold another 300,000 GM vehicles, suggesting that the total GM sales in South America (including sales in other South American countries such as Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, etc.) in that year were at a similar level to sales in China.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2009, General Motors sold 6.5 million cars and trucks globally; in 2010, it sold 8.39 million.[177] Sales in China rose 66.9% in 2009 to 1,830,000 vehicles and accounting for 13.4% of the market.[178]\n\n\nIn 2010, General Motors ranked second worldwide with 8.5 million vehicles produced.[179] In 2011, GM returned to the first place with 9.025 million units sold worldwide, corresponding to 11.9% market share of the global motor vehicle industry. In 2010, vehicle sales in China by GM rose 28.8% to a record 2,351,610 units.[180] The top two markets in 2011 were China, with 2,547,203 units, and the United States, with 2,503,820 vehicles sold. The Chevrolet brand was the main contributor to GM performance, with 4.76 million vehicles sold around the world in 2011, a global sales record.[181]\n\n\nBased on global sales in 2012, General Motors was ranked among the world's largest automakers.[182]\n\n\nIn May 2012, GM recorded an 18.4% market share in the U.S. with stock imported.[183]\n\n\nAnnual worldwide sales volume reached 10 million vehicles in 2016.[184][185][186] Sales in India for April 2016 – March 2017 declined to 25,823 units from 32,540 the previous year and market share contracted from 1.17% to 0.85% for the same period. However, exports surged 89% during the same period to 70,969 units. GMTC-I, GM's technical center in Bangalore, India continued in operation. Weak product line-up and below par service quality were the reasons for the poor showing by GM in India that year.[187][188]\n\n\nGlobal Volt/Ampera family sales totalled about 177,000 units from its inception in December 2010 through 2018.[189] including over 10,000 Opel/Vauxhall Amperas sold in Europe up to December 2015.[190][191] The Volt family of vehicles ranked as the world's all-time top-selling plug-in hybrid as of September 2018[update], and it is also the third best selling plug-in electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf (375,000) and the Tesla Model S (253,000), as of October 2018[update].[189] The Chevrolet Volt is also the U.S. all-time top-selling plug-in electric car with 148,556 units delivered through October 2018.[192][193]\n\n\n\n\n\nGM worldwide 2008 vehicle sales[194]  \n(thousands)\n| Rankin GM\n | Location\n | Vehiclesales\n | Marketshare (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) United States | 2,981 | 22.1%\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image) China | 1,095 | 12.0%\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Brazil | 549 | 19.5%\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) United Kingdom | 384 | 15.4%\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) Canada | 359 | 21.4%\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image) Russia | 338 | 11.1%\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image) Germany | 300 | 8.8%\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image) Mexico | 212 | 19.8%\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image) Australia | 133 | 13.1%\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image) South Korea | 117 | 9.7%\n |\n| 11\n | ![](image) France | 114 | 4.4%\n |\n| 12\n | ![](image) Spain | 107 | 7.8%\n |\n| 13\n | ![](image) Argentina | 95 | 15.5%\n |\n| 14\n | ![](image) Venezuela | 91 | 33.3%\n |\n| 15\n | ![](image) Colombia | 80 | 36.3%\n |\n| 16\n | ![](image) India | 66 | 3.3%\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | U.S. sales(vehicles)\n | Chg/yr.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998[195] | 4,603,991\n |  |\n| 1999\n | 5,017,150\n | ![Increase](image)9.0%\n |\n| 2000[196] | 4,953,163\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2001\n | 4,904,015\n | ![Decrease](image)1.0%\n |\n| 2002\n | 4,858,705\n | ![Decrease](image)0.9%\n |\n| 2003\n | 4,756,403\n | ![Decrease](image)2.1%\n |\n| 2004[197] | 4,707,416\n | ![Decrease](image)1.0%\n |\n| 2005\n | 4,517,730\n | ![Decrease](image)4.0%\n |\n| 2006[198] | 4,124,645\n | ![Decrease](image)8.7%\n |\n| 2007[199] | 3,866,620\n | ![Decrease](image)6.3%\n |\n| 2008[200] | 2,980,688\n | ![Decrease](image)22.9%\n |\n| 2009[201] | 2,084,492\n | ![Decrease](image)30.1%\n |\n| 2010[202] | 2,215,227\n | ![Increase](image)6.3%\n |\n| 2011[203] | 2,503,820\n | ![Increase](image)13.7%\n |\n| 2012\n | 2,595,717\n | ![Increase](image)3.7%\n |\n| 2013[204] | 2,786,078\n | ![Increase](image)7.3%\n |\n| 2014[205] | 2,935,008\n | ![Increase](image)5.3%\n |\n| 2015[206] | 3,082,366\n | ![Increase](image)5.0%\n |\n| 2016\n | 3,042,773\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2017\n | 3,002,241\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,954,037\n | ![Decrease](image)1.5%\n |\n| 2019[207] | 2,887,046\n | ![Decrease](image)2.3%\n |\n| 2020[208] | 2,547,339\n | ![Decrease](image)11.8%\n |\n| 2021[209] | 2,218,228\n | ![Decrease](image)12.9%\n |\n| 2022[209] | 2,274,088\n | ![Increase](image)2.5%\n |\n\n\n\n\nGM worldwide 2019 vehicle sales[210]\n| Location\n | Total sales\n | Year-On-Yearchange\n | Year-On-Yearchange (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GM North America | 3,367,374 | (122,740) | (3.5)\n |\n| GM Europe | 3,590 | (266) | (6.9)\n |\n| GM South America | 668,842 | (21,355) | (3.1)\n |\n| GM International | 584,520 | 28,033 | 5.0\n |\n| China | 3,093,604 | (551,440) | (15.1)\n |\n| Total | 7,717,930 | (667,768) | (8.0)\n |\n\n\n## Management[edit]\n\n\n### Current board of directors[edit]\n\n\nNotable members of the board of directors of the company are as follows:[2]\n\n\n\n* Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO of General Motors\n* Joseph Ashton, former Vice President of the International Union at United Automobile Workers\n* Linda Gooden, former Vice President of Information Systems and Global Solutions at Lockheed Martin\n* Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis\n* Jane Mendillo, former President and CEO at Harvard Management Company\n* Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n* James Mulva, former CEO, President, and Chairman at ConocoPhillips\n* Patricia Russo, CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n* Thomas Schoewe, former CFO of Wal-Mart Stores\n* Theodore Solso, former CEO and Chairman of Cummins\n* Carol Stephenson, former dean at Ivey Business School\n* Devin Wenig, former President and CEO of eBay\n* Jon McNeill, CEO of DVx Ventures LLC\n\n### Chairmen of the Board of General Motors[edit]\n\n\n* Thomas Neal—November 19, 1912 – November 16, 1915\n* Pierre S. du Pont—November 16, 1915 – February 7, 1929\n* Lammot du Pont II—February 7, 1929 – May 3, 1937\n* Alfred P.

The program involved five designers, each lending their artistic talents to customize five different vehicles. Nicole Miller, Richard Tyler, Anna Sui, Todd Oldham, and Mark Eisen were tasked with transforming a Cadillac STS, Buick Riviera, GMC Yukon, Oldsmobile Bravada and Chevrolet Camaro Z28, respectively. The cars were then auctioned with the proceeds presented to the Nina Hyde Center at the Greater LA Auto Show in 1997.[215][216][217][218]\n\n\nSince 1997, GM has been a source of funding for Safe Kids Worldwide's \"Safe Kids Buckle Up\" program, an initiative to ensure child automobile safety through education and inspection.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Labor conflicts[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Motors' American workers are unionized generally under the United Auto Workers (UAW), which is the primary auto workers union in the United States.\n\n\n\n### Flint sit-down strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flint sit-down strike\n\n![](image)Young striker off sentry duty sleeping on the assembly line of auto seats\nThe 1936–1937 Flint sit-down strike against General Motors changed the UAW from a collection of isolated local unions on the fringes of the industry into a major labor union and led to the unionization of the domestic United States automobile industry.\n\n\nAfter the first convention of UAW in 1936, the union decided that it could not survive by piecemeal organizing campaigns at smaller plants, as it had in the past, but that it could organize the automobile industry only by going after its biggest and most powerful employer, General Motors, focusing on GM's production complex in Flint, Michigan.\n\n\nOrganizing in Flint was a difficult and dangerous plan. GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. According to Wyndham Mortimer, the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint, he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in 1936. GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members secret and meeting workers at their homes.\n\n\nAs the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the dies from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for Buicks, Pontiacs, and Oldsmobiles, and another in Cleveland that produced Chevrolet parts.\n\n\n\n![](image)National Guardsmen with machine guns overlooking Chevrolet factories number nine and number four\nWhile the UAW called for a sit-down strike in Flint, the police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts. At the time, Vice President John Nance Garner supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re-open. The strike ended after 44 days.\n\n\nThat development forced GM to bargain with the union. John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President Homer Martin was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW, so Governor Frank Murphy acted as a courier and intermediary between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the U.S. National Guard not to evict the strikers but rather to protect them from the police and corporate strike-breakers. The two parties finally reached an agreement on February 11, 1937, on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees, who were union members for the next six months.[221]\n\n\n\n### Tool and die strike of 1939[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tool and die strike of 1939\n\nThe tool and die strike of 1939, also known as the \"strategy strike\", was an ultimately successful attempt by the UAW to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers. In addition to representation rights, the UAW, working jointly with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), sought to resolve existing grievances of skilled workers.\n\n\n\n### United Auto Workers (UAW) strike of 1945–1946[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1945-46 United Auto Workers strike\n\nFrom November 21, 1945, until March 13, 1946, (113 days) the UAW organized \"320,000 hourly workers\" to form a US-wide strike against the General Motors Corporation, workers used the tactic of the sit down strike.[222] It was \"the longest strike against a major manufacturer\" that the UAW had yet seen, and it was also \"the longest national GM strike in its history\".[222] As director of the UAW's General Motors Department (coordinator of union relations with GM),[223] Walter Reuther suggested to his colleagues the idea of striking the GM manufacturing plants with a 'one-at-a-time' strategy, which was \"intended to maximize pressure on the target company\".[222] Reuther also put forth the demands of the strikers: a 30 percent increase in wages and a hold on product prices. However, the strike ended with the dissatisfaction of Walter Reuther and the UAW, and the workers received only a 17.5-percent increase in wages.\n\n\n\n### 2007 General Motors strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2007 General Motors strike\n\nThe 2007 General Motors strike was a strike from September 24 to 26, 2007, by the UAW against General Motors.\n\n\nOn September 24, 2007, General Motors workers represented by the UAW union went on strike against the company. The first US-wide strike against GM since 1970 was expected to idle 59 plants and facilities for an indefinite period of time. Talks broke down after more than 20 straight days of bargaining failed to produce a new contract. Major issues that proved to be stumbling blocks for an agreement included wages, benefits, job security and investments in US facilities.[224][225][226]\n\n\nTwo car assembly plants in Oshawa, Ontario and a transmission facility in Windsor closed on September 25. However, on September 26, a tentative agreement was reached, and the strike's end was announced by UAW officials in a news conference at 4 a.m.[227] By the following day, all GM workers in both countries were back to work.\n\n\n\n### 2019 General Motors strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 General Motors strike\n\nOn the morning of September 15, 2019, after talks broke down to renew their contract, which expired earlier that day, the UAW announced that GM employees would begin striking at 11:59 pm.[228] This strike shut down operations in nine states, including 33 manufacturing plants and 22 parts distribution warehouses.[229] After 40 days, on October 25, 2019, the \"longest strike by autoworkers in a decade\" and the longest against GM since 1970 came to an end when United Auto Workers members voted to approve a new contract with GM. Striking labor union members received a $275 a week strike pay salary for the duration of the strike.[230] The strike cost GM more than $2 billion.\n\n\n\n### 2023 United Auto Workers strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 United Auto Workers strike\n\nThe ongoing strike launched by the UAW is the first strike against all three major American automakers in history. Then-recently elected UAW president Shawn Fain stated that he was \"fed up\" with the current situation between workers and automakers; Fain specifically blasted the tiered workers system at automakers, failure for automakers to keep wages up with inflation, pensions, as well as the introduction of a four-day workweek as opposed to the five-day workweek. GM CEO Mary Barra protested that her company offered an \"unprecedented deal\" which gave workers 20% raises as well as \"world-class\" healthcare. Barra further stated that meeting all 1,000 plus demands would bankrupt the company and cost over $100 billion.[231][232]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Streetcar conspiracy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: General Motors streetcar conspiracy\n\nBetween 1938 and 1950, GM allegedly deliberately monopolized the sale of buses and supplies to National City Lines (NCL) and its subsidiaries, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, intending to dismantle streetcar systems in many cities in the United States and make buses, sold by GM, the dominant form of public transport.\n\n\n\n### Ralph Nader and the Corvair[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1961–63 Corvair swing-axle rear suspension\n*Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile* by Ralph Nader, published in 1965, is a book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety. It relates to the first models of the Chevrolet Corvair (1960–1964) that had a swing axle suspension design that was prone to 'tuck under' in certain circumstances. To compensate for the removal of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar) as a cost-cutting measure, Corvairs required tire pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15 psi front, 26 psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30 psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was dangerous over-steer.[233]\n\n\nIn early March 1966, several media outlets, including *The New Republic* and *The New York Times*, alleged that GM had tried to discredit Ralph Nader, hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past, and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.[234][235] Nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for $425,000. Nader's lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals, whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover \"overzealous surveillance\".[236] Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.\n\n\nA 1972 safety commission report conducted by Texas A&M University concluded that the 1960–1963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations.[237] The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of NHTSA testing from the previous year. NHTSA conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars — a Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, Volkswagen Beetle, and Renault Dauphine — along with a second-generation Corvair (with its completely redesigned, independent rear suspension). The 143-page report reviewed NHTSA's extreme-condition handling tests, national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors' internal documentation regarding the Corvair's handling.[238] NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests. This review panel concluded that 'the 1960–63 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests ... the handling and stability performance of the 1960–63 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic'.\n\n\nFormer GM executive John DeLorean asserted, in his book *On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors*, that Nader's criticisms were valid.[239]\n\n\nJournalist David E. Davis noted that despite Nader's claim that swing-axle rear suspension were dangerous, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era.[240]\n\n\n\n### Apartheid[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, GM (along with other multinational corporations) was sued by a group of South Africans represented by the Khulumani Support Group.[241] The plaintiffs alleged that the company provided vehicles to the South African security forces during the Apartheid. The company settled with the plaintiffs in 2012, agreeing to pay a sum of up to $1.5 million.[242]\n\n\n\n### Ignition switch recall[edit]\n\n\nMain article: General Motors ignition switch recalls\n\nIn May 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade, despite knowing there was a problem with the switches. General Motors paid compensation for 124 deaths linked to the faulty switches.[243] The $35 million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose.[244] The total cost of the recall was estimated to be $1.5 billion.[142] As well as the Cobalts, the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars, such as the Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion, the Chevrolet HHR, the Saturn Sky, and Pontiac Solstice. The recall involved about 2.6 million GM cars worldwide.[245]\n\n\n\n### Xinjiang region[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including General Motors, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang.[246]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Michigan portal\n* ![](image)Cars portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers\n* ASOTRECOL\n* Crucible Industries\n* EcoCAR\n* General Motors Hy-wire\n* General Motors proving grounds\n* General Motors Technical Center\n* GM people\n* GM vehicles by brand\n* List of automobile manufacturers of the United States\n* List of GM engines\n* List of General Motors factories\n* List of General Motors platforms\n* List of GM transmissions\n* United States Council for Automotive Research\n* VIA Motors\n* Freon\n* Global Climate Coalition\n* Ethyl Corporation\n* Durant Motors\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Department of State, Division of Corporations (General Information Name Search)\".

By sales, it was the largest automaker in the United States in 2022, and was the largest in the world for 77 years before losing the top spot to Toyota in 2008.[4][5]\n\n\nGeneral Motors operates manufacturing plants in eight countries.[6] In addition to its four core brands, GM also holds interests in Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling via SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile.[2] GM further owns the BrightDrop delivery vehicle manufacturer,[7] a namesake defense vehicles division which produces military vehicles for the United States government and military,[8] the vehicle safety, security, and information services provider OnStar,[9] the auto parts company ACDelco, a namesake financial lending service, and majority ownership in the self-driving cars enterprise Cruise LLC.\n\n\nThe company traces itself to a holding company for Buick established on September 16, 1908, by William C. Durant, the largest seller of horse-drawn vehicles at the time. The first half of the 20th century saw the company grow into an automotive behemoth through acquisitions; going into the second half, the company pursued innovation and new offerings to consumers as well as collaborations with NASA to develop the earliest electric vehicles.[10][11] The current entity was established in 2009 after the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.[12]\n\n\nToday, General Motors remains a successful company, ranking 25th by total revenue out of all American companies on the *Fortune 500* and 50th on the *Fortune Global 500*.[13][14] The company is presently heavily pursuing electric vehicles, as GM announced plans in January 2021 to end production and sales of vehicles using internal combustion engines, including hybrid vehicles and plug-in hybrids, by 2035, as part of its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of General Motors\n\n### Founding and consolidation[edit]\n\n\nBy 1900, William C. Durant's Durant-Dort Carriage Company of Flint, Michigan had become the largest manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles in the United States.[16] Durant was averse to automobiles, but fellow Flint businessman James H. Whiting, owner of Flint Wagon Works, sold him the Buick Motor Company in 1904.[17] Durant formed the General Motors Company in 1908 as a holding company, with partner Charles Stewart Mott, borrowing a naming convention from General Electric.[18] GM's first acquisition was Buick, which Durant already owned, then Olds Motor Works on November 12, 1908.[19] Under Durant, GM went on to acquire Cadillac, Elmore, Welch, Cartercar, Oakland (the predecessor of Pontiac), the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of Pontiac, Michigan, and the Reliance Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan (predecessors of GMC) in 1909.\n\n\nDurant, with the board's approval, also tried acquiring Ford Motor Company, but needed an additional $2 million.[20] Durant over-leveraged GM in making acquisitions, and was removed by the board of directors in 1910 at the order of the bankers who backed the loans to keep GM in business.[17] The action of the bankers was partially influenced by the Panic of 1910–1911 that followed the earlier enforcement of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering of Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO) and Henry M. Leland invented and patented the first electric starter in America.[21] In November 1911, Durant co-founded Chevrolet with Swiss race car driver Louis Chevrolet, who left the company in 1915 after a disagreement with Durant.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Motors Company share certificate issued October 13, 1916\nGM was reincorporated in Detroit in 1916 as General Motors Corporation and became a public company via an initial public offering. By 1917, Chevrolet had become successful enough that Durant, with the backing of Samuel McLaughlin and Pierre S. du Pont, reacquired a controlling interest in GM. The same year, GM acquired Samson Tractor.[23] Chevrolet Motor Company was consolidated into GM on May 2, 1918, and the same year GM acquired United Motors, a parts supplier founded by Durant and headed by Alfred P. Sloan for $45 million, and the McLaughlin Motor Car Company, founded by R. S. McLaughlin, became General Motors of Canada Limited.[24][25][26] In 1919, GM acquired Guardian Frigerator Company, part-owned by Durant, which was renamed Frigidaire. Also in 1919, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), which provides financing to automotive customers, was formed.[27][17]\n\n\nIn 1920, du Pont orchestrated the removal of Durant once again and replaced him with Alfred P. Sloan.[28] At a time when GM was competing heavily with Ford Motor Company, Sloan established annual model changes, making previous years' models \"dated\" and created a market for used cars.[29] He also implemented the pricing strategy used by car companies today. The pricing strategy had Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac priced from least expensive to most, respectively.[30][*page needed*]\n\n\nIn 1921, Thomas Midgley Jr., an engineer for GM, discovered tetraethyllead (leaded gasoline) as an antiknock agent, and GM patented the compound because ethanol could not be patented.[31] This led to the development of higher compression engines resulting in more power and efficiency. The public later realized that lead contained in the gasoline was harmful to various biological organisms including humans.[32] Evidence shows that corporate executives understood the health implications of tetraethyllead from the beginning.[33] As an engineer for GM, Midgley also developed chlorofluorocarbons, which have now been banned due to their contribution to climate change.[34]\n\n\nUnder the encouragement of GM President Alfred P. Sloan Jr., GM acquired Vauxhall Motors for $2.5 million in 1925.[35] The company also acquired an interest in the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company the same year, and its president, John D. Hertz, joined the board of directors of GM; it acquired the remainder of the company in 1943.[17]\n\n\n\n### Growth and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1926, the company introduced the Pontiac brand and established the General Motors Group Insurance Program to provide life insurance to its employees.[17] The following year, after the success of the 1927 model of the Cadillac LaSalle designed by Harley Earl, Sloan created the \"Art and Color Section\" of GM and named Earl as its first director. Earl was the first design executive to be appointed to leadership at a major American corporation. Earl created a system of automobile design that is still practiced today.[36] At the age of 24, Bill Mitchell was recruited by Harley Earl to the design team at GM, and he was later appointed as Chief Designer of Cadillac. After Earl retired in December 1958, Mitchell took over automotive design for GM.[37] Also in 1926 the company acquired Fisher Body, its supplier of automobile bodies.[38]\n\n\nGM acquired Allison Engine Company[17][39] and began developing a 1,000 horsepower liquid-cooled aircraft engine in 1929.[17] The same year, GM acquired 80% of Opel, which at that time had a 37.5% market share in Europe, for $26 million. It acquired the remaining 20% in 1931.[35]\n\n\nIn the late-1920s, Charles Kettering embarked on a program to develop a lightweight two-stroke diesel engine for possible usage in automobiles.[40] Soon after, GM acquired Electro-Motive Company and the Winton Engine Co., and in 1941, it expanded EMC's realm to locomotive engine manufacturing.[41]\n\n\nIn 1932, GM acquired Packard Electric[17][42] (not the Packard car company, which merged with Studebaker years later). The following year, GM acquired a controlling interest in North American Aviation and merged it with the General Aviation Manufacturing Corporation.[43]\n\n\nThe GM labor force participated in the formation of the United Auto Workers labor union in 1935, and in 1936 the UAW organized the Flint Sit-Down Strike, which initially idled two key plants in Flint, Michigan, and later spread to 6 other plants including those in Janesville, Wisconsin and Fort Wayne, Indiana. In Flint, police attempted to enter the plant to arrest strikers, leading to violence; in other cities, the plants were shuttered peacefully. The strike was resolved on February 11, 1937, when GM recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for its workers and gave workers a 5% raise and permission to speak in the lunchroom.[44]\n\n\nWalter E. Jominy and A.L. Boegehold of GM invented the Jominy end-quench test for hardenability of carbon steel in 1937, a breakthrough in heat treating still in use today as ASTM A255.[45] GM established Detroit Diesel the next year.[46]\n\n\nIn 1939, the company founded Motors Insurance Corporation and entered the vehicle insurance market.[27] The same year, GM introduced the Hydramatic, the first affordable and successful automatic transmission, for the 1940 Oldsmobile.[47][48]\n\n\n\n* ![1926 Pontiac radiator logo](image)\n\n1926 Pontiac radiator logo\n* ![1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe](image)\n\n1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe\n\nDuring World War II, GM produced vast quantities of armaments, vehicles, and aircraft for the Allies of World War II. In 1940, GM's William S. Knudsen served as head of U.S. wartime production for President Franklin Roosevelt, and by 1942, all of GM's production was to support the war.[49] GM's Vauxhall Motors manufactured the Churchill tank series for the Allies, instrumental in the North African campaign.[17] However, its Opel division, based in Germany, supplied the Nazi Party with vehicles. Sloan, head of GM at the time, was an ardent opponent of the New Deal, which bolstered labor unions and public transport, and Sloan admired and supported Adolf Hitler.[50] Nazi armaments chief Albert Speer allegedly said in 1977 that Hitler \"would never have considered invading Poland\" without synthetic fuel technology provided by General Motors. GM was compensated $32 million by the U.S. government because its German factories were bombed by U.S. forces during the war.[51]\n\n\nEffective January 28, 1953, Charles Erwin Wilson, then GM president, was named by Dwight D. Eisenhower as United States Secretary of Defense.[17]\n\n\nIn December 1953, GM acquired Euclid Trucks, a manufacturer of heavy equipment for earthmoving, including dump trucks, loaders and wheel tractor-scrapers, which later spawned the Terex brand.[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Periods of innovation[edit]\n\n\nAlfred P. Sloan retired as chairman and was succeeded by Albert Bradley in April 1956.[54]\n\n\nIn 1962, GM introduced the first turbo charged engine in the world for a car in the Oldsmobile Cutlass Turbo-Jetfire.[17][55] Two years later, the company introduced its \"Mark of Excellence\" logo and trademark at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The company used the mark as their main corporate identifier until 2021.[56]\n\n\nGM released the Electrovan in 1966, the first hydrogen fuel cell car ever produced.[57] Though fuel cells have existed since the early 1800s, General Motors was the first to use a fuel cell, supplied by Union Carbide, to power the wheels of a vehicle with a budget of \"millions of dollars\".[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1969 Chevrolet Nova using the advertising slogan *\"Putting you first, keeps us first\"*\nIn the 1960s, GM was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of V6 engines, but quickly lost interest as the popularity of muscle cars increased. GM demonstrated gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene, an area of interest throughout the industry, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration due to the 1973 oil crisis.[61]\n\n\nIn partnership with Boeing, GM's Delco Defense Electronics Division designed the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which traversed the surface of the Moon, in 1971.[62][63] The following year, GM produced the first rear wheel anti-lock braking system for two models: the Toronado and Eldorado.[64]\n\n\nIn 1973, the Oldsmobile Toronado was the first retail car sold with a passenger airbag.[65][66]\n\n\nThomas Murphy became CEO of the company, succeeding Richard C. Gerstenberg in November 1974.[67][68]\n\n\nGM installed its first catalytic converters in its 1975 models.[69]\n\n\nFrom 1978 to 1985, GM pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies. However, it had disastrous results due to poor durability in the Oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the Cadillac V8-6-4 variable-cylinder engines.[70]\n\n\nGM sold Frigidaire in 1979. Although Frigidaire had between $450 million and $500 million in annual revenues, it was losing money.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Motors headquarters building, 1981\nRobert Lee of GM invented the Fe14Nd2B the Neodymium magnet, which was fabricated by rapid solidification, in 1984.[72] This magnet is commonly used in products like a computer hard disk. The same year, GM acquired Electronic Data Systems for $2.5 billion from Ross Perot as part of a strategy by CEO Roger Smith to derive at least 10% of its annual worldwide revenue from non-automotive sources.[73] GM also intended to have EDS handle its bookkeeping, help computerize factories, and integrate GM's computer systems. The transaction made Ross Perot the largest shareholder of GM; however, disagreements with Roger Smith led the company to buy all shares held by Ross Perot for $750 million in 1986.[74]\n\n\nIn a continuation of its diversification plans, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage in 1985. This acquisition included an $11 billion mortgage portfolio.[75] The same year, GM acquired the Hughes Aircraft Company for $5 billion in cash and stock and merged it into Delco Electronics.[76] The following year, GM acquired 59.7% of Lotus Cars, a British producer of high-performance sports cars.[77]\n\n\nIn 1987, in conjunction with AeroVironment, GM built the Sunraycer, which won the inaugural World Solar Challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by Aerovironment) and was the predecessor to the General Motors EV1.[78]\n\n\nIn 1988, GM acquired a 15% stake in AeroVironment.[79]\n\n\nIn 1989, GM acquired half of Saab Automobile's car operations for $600 million.[80]\n\n\n\n### Sales of assets[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1990, Robert Stempel became CEO of the company, succeeding Roger Smith.[81] GM cut output significantly and suffered losses that year due to the early 1990s recession.[82]\n\n\nIn 1990, GM debuted the General Motors EV1 (Impact) concept, a battery electric vehicle, at the LA Auto Show. It was the first car with zero emissions marketed in the US in over three decades. The Impact was produced as the EV1 for the 1996 model year and was available only via lease from certain dealers in California and Arizona. In 1999–2002, GM ceased production of the vehicles and started to not renew the leases, disappointing many people, allegedly because the program would not be profitable and would cannibalize its existing business. All of the EV1s were eventually returned to General Motors, and except for around 40 which were donated to museums with their electric powertrains deactivated, all were destroyed. The documentary film *Who Killed the Electric Car?* covered the EV1 story.[83]\n\n\nIn November 1992, John F. Smith Jr. became CEO of the company.[84]\n\n\nIn 1993, GM sold Lotus Cars to Bugatti.[85]\n\n\nIn 1996, in a return to its automotive basics, GM completed the corporate spin-off of Electronic Data Systems.[86][87]\n\n\nIn 1997, GM sold the military businesses of Hughes Aircraft Company to Raytheon Company for $9.5 billion in stock and the assumption of debt.[88][89][90][91]\n\n\nIn February 2000, Rick Wagoner was named CEO, succeeding John F. Smith Jr.[92][93] The next month, GM gave 5.1% of its common stock, worth $2.4 billion, to acquire a 20% share of Fiat.[94]\n\n\nIn December 2000, GM announced that it would begin phasing out Oldsmobile. The brand was eventually discontinued in 2004, seven years after it had become the first American car brand to turn 100.[95]\n\n\n\n* ![Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid vehicle](image)\n\nChevrolet Tahoe hybrid vehicle\n* ![Second generation Chevrolet Volt](image)\n\nSecond generation Chevrolet Volt\n* ![The Chevrolet Volt](image)\n\nThe Chevrolet Volt\n* ![The General Motors EV1, an electric car, was introduced in California in 1996.](image)\n\nThe General Motors EV1, an electric car, was introduced in California in 1996.\n\nIn May 2004, GM delivered the first full-sized pickup truck hybrid vehicles, the 1/2-ton Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra trucks.[96] These mild hybrids did not use electrical energy for propulsion, like GM's later designs. Later, the company debuted another hybrid technology, co-developed with DaimlerChrysler and BMW, in diesel-electric hybrid powertrain manufactured by Allison Transmission for transit buses.[97] Continuing to target the diesel-hybrid market, the Opel Astra diesel engine hybrid concept vehicle was rolled out in January 2005.[98] Later that year, GM sold its Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive division to private equity firms Berkshire Partners and Greenbriar Equity Group.[99][100]\n\n\nGM paid $2 billion to sever its ties with Fiat in 2005, severing ties with the company due to an increasingly contentious dispute.[101]\n\n\nGM began adding its \"Mark of Excellence\" emblem on all new vehicles produced and sold in North America in mid-2005. However, after the reorganization in 2009, the company no longer added the logo, saying that emphasis on its four core divisions would downplay the GM logo.[102][103]\n\n\nIn 2005, Edward T. Welburn was promoted to the newly created position of vice president, GM Global Design, making him the first African American to lead a global automotive design organization and the highest-ranking African American in the US motor industry at that time. On July 1, 2016, he retired from General Motors after 44 years. He was replaced by Michael Simcoe.[104][105]\n\n\nIn 2006, GM introduced a bright yellow fuel cap on its vehicles to remind drivers that cars can operate using E85 ethanol fuel.[106] They also introduced another hybrid vehicle that year, the Saturn Vue Green Line.[107]\n\n\nIn 2008, General Motors committed to engineering half of its manufacturing plants to be landfill-free by recycling or reusing waste in the manufacturing process.[108] Continuing their environmental-conscious development, GM started to offer the 2-mode hybrid system in the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Cadillac Escalade, and pickup trucks.[109]\n\n\nIn late 2008, the world's largest rooftop solar power installation was installed at GM's manufacturing plant in Zaragoza. The Zaragoza solar installation has about 2,000,000 square feet (190,000 m2) of roof at the plant and contains about 85,000 solar panels. The installation was created, owned and operated by Veolia Environment and Clairvoyant Energy, which leases the rooftop area from GM.[110][111][112]\n\n\n\n### Chapter 11 bankruptcy and bailout[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization\n\nIn March 2009, after the company had received $17.4 billion in bailouts but was not effective in a turnaround, President Barack Obama forced the resignation of CEO Rick Wagoner.[113]\n\n\nGeneral Motors filed for a government-backed Chapter 11 reorganization on June 8, 2009.[114][115] On July 10, 2009, the original General Motors sold assets and some subsidiaries to an entirely new company, including the trademark \"General Motors\".[114][115] Liabilities were left with the original GM, renamed Motors Liquidation Company, freeing the companies of many liabilities and resulting in a new GM.[114][115]\n\n\nThrough the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $49.5 billion in General Motors and recovered $39 billion when it sold its shares on December 9, 2013, resulting in a loss of $10.3 billion. The Treasury invested an additional $17.2 billion into GM's former financing company, GMAC (now Ally Financial). The shares in Ally were sold on December 18, 2014, for $19.6 billion netting the government $2.4 billion in profit, including dividends.[116][117] A study by the Center for Automotive Research found that the GM bailout saved 1.2 million jobs and preserved $34.9 billion in tax revenue.[118]\n\n\nGeneral Motors Canada was not part of the General Motors Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[119]\n\n\n\n### Post-reorganization[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2009, at the request of Steven Rattner, lead adviser to President Barack Obama on the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, Edward Whitacre Jr., who had led a restructuring of AT&T, was appointed as chairman of General Motors.[120] Whitacre was tasked with overseeing GM's emergence from bankruptcy and downsizing its sizable number of brand marques, many of which had produced chronic losses even before the recession began. In July 2009, after 40 days of bankruptcy protection, the company emerged from the government-backed General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.[121]\n\n\nAs mandated by its bailout agreement, GM began the process of shedding its poorest-performing brands in June 2009: Hummer, Saab, Saturn, and Pontiac. An October 2009 agreement to sell the Hummer brand to China-based Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd.[122] and a group of private investors fell through three months later, resulting in GM seeking a new suitor.[123] American company Raser Technologies, along with several others, expressed interest in buying the company, but none of the proposed acquisitions came to fruition, and in April 2010 GM said it was officially shutting down the Hummer brand.[124][125] Similarly, GM's efforts to sell its Saturn division yielded an early suitor. In June 2009, GM announced that the Saturn brand would be sold to the Penske Automotive Group.[126] The deal fell through, however, and GM declared the brand defunct in October 2010. While GM agreed to shed its underperforming Pontiac brand as part of its bailout agreement, the company explicitly opted not to sell it to another company.[127][128] The last Pontiac was built in January 2010.[129]\n\n\nGM was more successful in its attempts to sell Saab Automobile: the company closed a sale to Dutch automaker Spyker Cars in February 2010.[130] Saab continued to perform poorly under Spyker's management, however, and in 2012 the Saab division declared bankruptcy.\n\n\nIn December 2009, the \"new\" GM's board of directors asked CEO Fritz Henderson to resign, and its chairman, Ed Whitacre, was named interim CEO.[131] GM opted to appoint Whitacre as its permanent CEO the following month, though Whitacre ultimately stepped down as CEO in September 2010, relinquishing the position to fellow GM board member Daniel Akerson but agreeing to continue on as GM chairman until the end of the year. Akerson replaced him as chairman, while continuing as CEO, in January 2011.[132][133]\n\n\nIn 2010, GM introduced the Chevrolet Volt as an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), an electric vehicle with backup generators powered by gasoline, or series plug-in hybrid.[134][135] GM delivered the first Volt in December 2010.[136] The Chevrolet Volt was a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with back-up generators powered by gasoline (range-extended electric vehicle).[137] GM built a prototype two-seat electric vehicle with Segway Inc. An early prototype of the Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility vehicle—dubbed Project P.U.M.A. – was presented in New York at the 2009 New York International Auto Show.[138]\n\n\n\n* ![2nd generation Buick LaCrosse (2010–2016)[139][140]](image)\n\n2nd generation Buick LaCrosse (2010–2016)[139][140]\n* ![General Motors Sequel, a fuel cell-powered vehicle from GM.](image)\n\nGeneral Motors Sequel, a fuel cell-powered vehicle from GM.\n* ![E85 FlexFuel Chevrolet Impala LT 2009 (USA)](image)\n\nE85 FlexFuel Chevrolet Impala LT 2009 (USA)\n* ![The Chevrolet Bolt EV was released in late 2016.](image)\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV was released in late 2016.\n\nOn January 15, 2014, Mary Barra was named chief executive officer, succeeding Daniel Akerson. Barra also joined the GM board.[141] Only three weeks later, the company announced its 2014 General Motors recall, which was due to faulty ignition switches, and was linked to at least 124 deaths. The resulting settlements with family members of those killed were estimated to cost the company $1.5 billion.[142]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2016, in its first investment in a ridesharing company, GM invested $500 million in Lyft.[143][144] The company does not directly supply Lyft drivers with vehicles, however – and has no plans to do so in the future – and Lyft ultimately partnered with Motional for production of its autonomous vehicles.\n\n\nIn March 2016, GM acquired Cruise, a San Francisco self-driving vehicle start-up, to develop self-driving cars that could be used in ride-sharing fleets.[145][146] In June 2022, Cruise received California's first Driverless Deployment Permit, allowing it to both charge fees for its service as well as offer fully autonomous rides in a major public city.[147] *The Verge* reported that the company lost $561 million in Q1 2023, but said it remains on the path to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2025 and $50 billion by 2030.[148]\n\n\nIn October 2016, GM began production of the Chevrolet Bolt EV, the first-ever mass market all-electric car with a range of more than 200 miles (320 km).[149][150] The battery pack and most drivetrain components were built by LG Corporation and assembled in GM's plant in Lake Orion, Michigan.[151] GM chose to employ the Bolt EV and similar Bolt EUV for its Cruise ride-share service.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn January 8, 2021, GM introduced a new logo alongside the tagline \"EVerybody in\", with the capitalized \"EV\" as a nod to the company's commitment to electric vehicles.[152][153] GM's new logo used negative space to create the idea of an electric plug in the \"M\" of the logo.[154]\n\n\nAt the January 2021 Consumer Electronics Show, GM launched BrightDrop, its brand for all-electric commercial vehicles.[155]\n\n\nOn January 28, 2021, GM announced that it will end production and sales of fossil-fuel vehicles (including hybrids and plug-in hybrids) by 2035 as part of its plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2040.[156]\n\n\nIn 2021, GM announced plans to establish an automotive battery and battery pack laboratory in Michigan.[157][158][159] GM will be responsible for battery management systems and power electronics, thermal management, as well as the pack assembly. An existing GM facility at Brownstown Township was chosen to be upgraded as a battery pack plant.[134] LG Chem's U.S. subsidiary, Compact Power of Troy, Michigan, has been building the prototype packs for the development vehicles and will continue to provide integration support and acting as a liaison for the program.[160]\n\n\n\n### Motorsports history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chevrolet Corvette C8.R in the IMSA SportsCar Championship\nGM participated in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) from 2004 to 2012,[161] and has also participated in other motorsport championships, including 24 Hours of Le Mans,[162] NASCAR,[163] SCCA[164] and Supercars Championship.[165]\n\n\nGM's engines were successful in the Indy Racing League (IRL) throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small V8 class. GM has also done much work in the development of electronics for GM auto racing. An unmodified Aurora V8 in the Aerotech captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the Cadillac V-Series has entered motorsports racing.\n\n\nGM has also designed cars specifically for use in NASCAR auto racing. The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is the only entry in the series.[166] In the past, the Pontiac Grand Prix,[167] Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Malibu, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevrolet Impala, and the Chevrolet SS were also used. GM has won many NASCAR Cup Series manufacturer's championships, including 40 with Chevrolet,[168] the most of any make in NASCAR history, 3 with Oldsmobile, 2 with Buick, and 1 with Pontiac. In 2021, Chevrolet became the first brand to reach 800 wins.[169]\n\n\nIn Australia, Holden cars based on the Monaro, Torana and Commodore platforms raced in the Australian Touring Car Championship until 2022. Holden won the Bathurst 1000, a record 36 times between 1968 and 2022 and the Australian Touring Car Championship 23 times.[170] From 2023, the Chevrolet Camaro will be raced.[171]\n\n\n\n### Logo evolution[edit]\n\n\nEvolution of the GM logo through the years:[172]\n\n\n\n* ![1938–1964[172]](image)\n\n1938–1964[172]\n* ![Mark of Excellence (1964–2021)[172]](image)\n\nMark of Excellence (1964–2021)[172]\n* ![2001–2021[172]](image)\n\n2001–2021[172]\n* ![2010–2021[172]](image)\n\n2010–2021[172]\n* ![2021 (gradient)[172]](image)\n\n2021 (gradient)[172]\n* ![2021 (flat)[173]](image)\n\n2021 (flat)[173]\n* ![2022 (wordmark)[174]](image)\n\n2022 (wordmark)[174]\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\n### Current[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Markets served today\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) US | Buick | 1899 | 1903 | 1908 | China, North America\n |\n| ![](image) US | Cadillac | 1902 | 1902 | 1909 | North America, Middle East, China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Kazakhstan\n |\n| ![](image) US | Chevrolet | 1911 | 1911 | 1918 | Americas, China, Middle East, CIS, South Korea, Philippines, Japan, Europe, Australasia.\n |\n| ![](image) US | GMC | 1912 | 1912 | 1919 | North America, Middle East, South Korea\n |\n| ![](image) CHN | Baojun | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | China\n |\n| ![](image) CHN | Wuling | 2002 | 2002 | 2002 | China, Indonesia\n |\n\n\n### Former[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Fate\n | Defunct / Sold\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) CAN | Acadian | 1962 | 1962 | 1962 | Discontinued | 1971 | Canadian Chevy with Pontiac design accents\n |\n| ![](image) KOR | Alpheon | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | Discontinued | 2015 | The only available model was based on the Buick LaCrosse\n |\n| ![](image) CAN | Asüna | 1992 | 1992 | 1992 | Discontinued | 1994 | Composed of Suzuki, Isuzu and Toyota models.\n |\n| ![](image) CAN | Beaumont | 1966 | 1966 | 1966 | Discontinued | 1969 | Canadian Chevy with Pontiac design accents\n |\n| ![](image) UK | Bedford | 1931 | 1931 | 1931 | Discontinued | 1991 |  |\n| ![](image) US | Cartercar | 1905 | 1905 | 1909 | Discontinued | 1915 |  |\n| ![](image) KOR | Daewoo | 1972 | 1972 | 1999 | Discontinued | 2011 | Succeeded by GM Korea |\n| ![](image) US | Elmore | 1893 | 1900 | 1912 | Discontinued | 1916 |  |\n| ![](image) CAN | Envoy | 1959 | 1959 | 1959 | Discontinued | 1970 | Imported Vauxhall and Bedford vehicles sold at Canadian Chevrolet and Oldsmobile dealerships\n |\n| ![](image) CAN | Epic | 1964 | 1964 | 1964 | Discontinued | 1970 | Imported Vauxhall models sold at Canadian Pontiac, Buick and GMC dealerships\n |\n| ![](image) US | Garland |  |  | 1909 | Discontinued | 1909 |  |\n| ![](image) US | Geo | 1989 | 1989 | 1989 | Discontinued | 1997 | Composed of Suzuki, Isuzu and Toyota models.

This reign was longer than any other automaker, and GM is still among the world's largest automakers by vehicle unit sales.[176]\n\n\nIn 2008, the third-largest individual country by sales was Brazil, with some 550,000 GM vehicles sold. In that year, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela sold another 300,000 GM vehicles, suggesting that the total GM sales in South America (including sales in other South American countries such as Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, etc.) in that year were at a similar level to sales in China.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2009, General Motors sold 6.5 million cars and trucks globally; in 2010, it sold 8.39 million.[177] Sales in China rose 66.9% in 2009 to 1,830,000 vehicles and accounting for 13.4% of the market.[178]\n\n\nIn 2010, General Motors ranked second worldwide with 8.5 million vehicles produced.[179] In 2011, GM returned to the first place with 9.025 million units sold worldwide, corresponding to 11.9% market share of the global motor vehicle industry. In 2010, vehicle sales in China by GM rose 28.8% to a record 2,351,610 units.[180] The top two markets in 2011 were China, with 2,547,203 units, and the United States, with 2,503,820 vehicles sold. The Chevrolet brand was the main contributor to GM performance, with 4.76 million vehicles sold around the world in 2011, a global sales record.[181]\n\n\nBased on global sales in 2012, General Motors was ranked among the world's largest automakers.[182]\n\n\nIn May 2012, GM recorded an 18.4% market share in the U.S. with stock imported.[183]\n\n\nAnnual worldwide sales volume reached 10 million vehicles in 2016.[184][185][186] Sales in India for April 2016 – March 2017 declined to 25,823 units from 32,540 the previous year and market share contracted from 1.17% to 0.85% for the same period. However, exports surged 89% during the same period to 70,969 units. GMTC-I, GM's technical center in Bangalore, India continued in operation. Weak product line-up and below par service quality were the reasons for the poor showing by GM in India that year.[187][188]\n\n\nGlobal Volt/Ampera family sales totalled about 177,000 units from its inception in December 2010 through 2018.[189] including over 10,000 Opel/Vauxhall Amperas sold in Europe up to December 2015.[190][191] The Volt family of vehicles ranked as the world's all-time top-selling plug-in hybrid as of September 2018[update], and it is also the third best selling plug-in electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf (375,000) and the Tesla Model S (253,000), as of October 2018[update].[189] The Chevrolet Volt is also the U.S. all-time top-selling plug-in electric car with 148,556 units delivered through October 2018.[192][193]\n\n\n\n\n\nGM worldwide 2008 vehicle sales[194]  \n(thousands)\n| Rankin GM\n | Location\n | Vehiclesales\n | Marketshare (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) United States | 2,981 | 22.1%\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image) China | 1,095 | 12.0%\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Brazil | 549 | 19.5%\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) United Kingdom | 384 | 15.4%\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) Canada | 359 | 21.4%\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image) Russia | 338 | 11.1%\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image) Germany | 300 | 8.8%\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image) Mexico | 212 | 19.8%\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image) Australia | 133 | 13.1%\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image) South Korea | 117 | 9.7%\n |\n| 11\n | ![](image) France | 114 | 4.4%\n |\n| 12\n | ![](image) Spain | 107 | 7.8%\n |\n| 13\n | ![](image) Argentina | 95 | 15.5%\n |\n| 14\n | ![](image) Venezuela | 91 | 33.3%\n |\n| 15\n | ![](image) Colombia | 80 | 36.3%\n |\n| 16\n | ![](image) India | 66 | 3.3%\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | U.S. sales(vehicles)\n | Chg/yr.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998[195] | 4,603,991\n |  |\n| 1999\n | 5,017,150\n | ![Increase](image)9.0%\n |\n| 2000[196] | 4,953,163\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2001\n | 4,904,015\n | ![Decrease](image)1.0%\n |\n| 2002\n | 4,858,705\n | ![Decrease](image)0.9%\n |\n| 2003\n | 4,756,403\n | ![Decrease](image)2.1%\n |\n| 2004[197] | 4,707,416\n | ![Decrease](image)1.0%\n |\n| 2005\n | 4,517,730\n | ![Decrease](image)4.0%\n |\n| 2006[198] | 4,124,645\n | ![Decrease](image)8.7%\n |\n| 2007[199] | 3,866,620\n | ![Decrease](image)6.3%\n |\n| 2008[200] | 2,980,688\n | ![Decrease](image)22.9%\n |\n| 2009[201] | 2,084,492\n | ![Decrease](image)30.1%\n |\n| 2010[202] | 2,215,227\n | ![Increase](image)6.3%\n |\n| 2011[203] | 2,503,820\n | ![Increase](image)13.7%\n |\n| 2012\n | 2,595,717\n | ![Increase](image)3.7%\n |\n| 2013[204] | 2,786,078\n | ![Increase](image)7.3%\n |\n| 2014[205] | 2,935,008\n | ![Increase](image)5.3%\n |\n| 2015[206] | 3,082,366\n | ![Increase](image)5.0%\n |\n| 2016\n | 3,042,773\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2017\n | 3,002,241\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,954,037\n | ![Decrease](image)1.5%\n |\n| 2019[207] | 2,887,046\n | ![Decrease](image)2.3%\n |\n| 2020[208] | 2,547,339\n | ![Decrease](image)11.8%\n |\n| 2021[209] | 2,218,228\n | ![Decrease](image)12.9%\n |\n| 2022[209] | 2,274,088\n | ![Increase](image)2.5%\n |\n\n\n\n\nGM worldwide 2019 vehicle sales[210]\n| Location\n | Total sales\n | Year-On-Yearchange\n | Year-On-Yearchange (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GM North America | 3,367,374 | (122,740) | (3.5)\n |\n| GM Europe | 3,590 | (266) | (6.9)\n |\n| GM South America | 668,842 | (21,355) | (3.1)\n |\n| GM International | 584,520 | 28,033 | 5.0\n |\n| China | 3,093,604 | (551,440) | (15.1)\n |\n| Total | 7,717,930 | (667,768) | (8.0)\n |\n\n\n## Management[edit]\n\n\n### Current board of directors[edit]\n\n\nNotable members of the board of directors of the company are as follows:[2]\n\n\n\n* Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO of General Motors\n* Joseph Ashton, former Vice President of the International Union at United Automobile Workers\n* Linda Gooden, former Vice President of Information Systems and Global Solutions at Lockheed Martin\n* Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis\n* Jane Mendillo, former President and CEO at Harvard Management Company\n* Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n* James Mulva, former CEO, President, and Chairman at ConocoPhillips\n* Patricia Russo, CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n* Thomas Schoewe, former CFO of Wal-Mart Stores\n* Theodore Solso, former CEO and Chairman of Cummins\n* Carol Stephenson, former dean at Ivey Business School\n* Devin Wenig, former President and CEO of eBay\n* Jon McNeill, CEO of DVx Ventures LLC\n\n### Chairmen of the Board of General Motors[edit]\n\n\n* Thomas Neal—November 19, 1912 – November 16, 1915\n* Pierre S. du Pont—November 16, 1915 – February 7, 1929\n* Lammot du Pont II—February 7, 1929 – May 3, 1937\n* Alfred P.

The program involved five designers, each lending their artistic talents to customize five different vehicles. Nicole Miller, Richard Tyler, Anna Sui, Todd Oldham, and Mark Eisen were tasked with transforming a Cadillac STS, Buick Riviera, GMC Yukon, Oldsmobile Bravada and Chevrolet Camaro Z28, respectively. The cars were then auctioned with the proceeds presented to the Nina Hyde Center at the Greater LA Auto Show in 1997.[215][216][217][218]\n\n\nSince 1997, GM has been a source of funding for Safe Kids Worldwide's \"Safe Kids Buckle Up\" program, an initiative to ensure child automobile safety through education and inspection.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Labor conflicts[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Motors' American workers are unionized generally under the United Auto Workers (UAW), which is the primary auto workers union in the United States.\n\n\n\n### Flint sit-down strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flint sit-down strike\n\n![](image)Young striker off sentry duty sleeping on the assembly line of auto seats\nThe 1936–1937 Flint sit-down strike against General Motors changed the UAW from a collection of isolated local unions on the fringes of the industry into a major labor union and led to the unionization of the domestic United States automobile industry.\n\n\nAfter the first convention of UAW in 1936, the union decided that it could not survive by piecemeal organizing campaigns at smaller plants, as it had in the past, but that it could organize the automobile industry only by going after its biggest and most powerful employer, General Motors, focusing on GM's production complex in Flint, Michigan.\n\n\nOrganizing in Flint was a difficult and dangerous plan. GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. According to Wyndham Mortimer, the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint, he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in 1936. GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members secret and meeting workers at their homes.\n\n\nAs the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the dies from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for Buicks, Pontiacs, and Oldsmobiles, and another in Cleveland that produced Chevrolet parts.\n\n\n\n![](image)National Guardsmen with machine guns overlooking Chevrolet factories number nine and number four\nWhile the UAW called for a sit-down strike in Flint, the police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts. At the time, Vice President John Nance Garner supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re-open. The strike ended after 44 days.\n\n\nThat development forced GM to bargain with the union. John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President Homer Martin was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW, so Governor Frank Murphy acted as a courier and intermediary between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the U.S. National Guard not to evict the strikers but rather to protect them from the police and corporate strike-breakers. The two parties finally reached an agreement on February 11, 1937, on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees, who were union members for the next six months.[221]\n\n\n\n### Tool and die strike of 1939[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tool and die strike of 1939\n\nThe tool and die strike of 1939, also known as the \"strategy strike\", was an ultimately successful attempt by the UAW to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers. In addition to representation rights, the UAW, working jointly with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), sought to resolve existing grievances of skilled workers.\n\n\n\n### United Auto Workers (UAW) strike of 1945–1946[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1945-46 United Auto Workers strike\n\nFrom November 21, 1945, until March 13, 1946, (113 days) the UAW organized \"320,000 hourly workers\" to form a US-wide strike against the General Motors Corporation, workers used the tactic of the sit down strike.[222] It was \"the longest strike against a major manufacturer\" that the UAW had yet seen, and it was also \"the longest national GM strike in its history\".[222] As director of the UAW's General Motors Department (coordinator of union relations with GM),[223] Walter Reuther suggested to his colleagues the idea of striking the GM manufacturing plants with a 'one-at-a-time' strategy, which was \"intended to maximize pressure on the target company\".[222] Reuther also put forth the demands of the strikers: a 30 percent increase in wages and a hold on product prices. However, the strike ended with the dissatisfaction of Walter Reuther and the UAW, and the workers received only a 17.5-percent increase in wages.\n\n\n\n### 2007 General Motors strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2007 General Motors strike\n\nThe 2007 General Motors strike was a strike from September 24 to 26, 2007, by the UAW against General Motors.\n\n\nOn September 24, 2007, General Motors workers represented by the UAW union went on strike against the company. The first US-wide strike against GM since 1970 was expected to idle 59 plants and facilities for an indefinite period of time. Talks broke down after more than 20 straight days of bargaining failed to produce a new contract. Major issues that proved to be stumbling blocks for an agreement included wages, benefits, job security and investments in US facilities.[224][225][226]\n\n\nTwo car assembly plants in Oshawa, Ontario and a transmission facility in Windsor closed on September 25. However, on September 26, a tentative agreement was reached, and the strike's end was announced by UAW officials in a news conference at 4 a.m.[227] By the following day, all GM workers in both countries were back to work.\n\n\n\n### 2019 General Motors strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 General Motors strike\n\nOn the morning of September 15, 2019, after talks broke down to renew their contract, which expired earlier that day, the UAW announced that GM employees would begin striking at 11:59 pm.[228] This strike shut down operations in nine states, including 33 manufacturing plants and 22 parts distribution warehouses.[229] After 40 days, on October 25, 2019, the \"longest strike by autoworkers in a decade\" and the longest against GM since 1970 came to an end when United Auto Workers members voted to approve a new contract with GM. Striking labor union members received a $275 a week strike pay salary for the duration of the strike.[230] The strike cost GM more than $2 billion.\n\n\n\n### 2023 United Auto Workers strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 United Auto Workers strike\n\nThe ongoing strike launched by the UAW is the first strike against all three major American automakers in history. Then-recently elected UAW president Shawn Fain stated that he was \"fed up\" with the current situation between workers and automakers; Fain specifically blasted the tiered workers system at automakers, failure for automakers to keep wages up with inflation, pensions, as well as the introduction of a four-day workweek as opposed to the five-day workweek. GM CEO Mary Barra protested that her company offered an \"unprecedented deal\" which gave workers 20% raises as well as \"world-class\" healthcare. Barra further stated that meeting all 1,000 plus demands would bankrupt the company and cost over $100 billion.[231][232]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Streetcar conspiracy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: General Motors streetcar conspiracy\n\nBetween 1938 and 1950, GM allegedly deliberately monopolized the sale of buses and supplies to National City Lines (NCL) and its subsidiaries, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, intending to dismantle streetcar systems in many cities in the United States and make buses, sold by GM, the dominant form of public transport.\n\n\n\n### Ralph Nader and the Corvair[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1961–63 Corvair swing-axle rear suspension\n*Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile* by Ralph Nader, published in 1965, is a book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety. It relates to the first models of the Chevrolet Corvair (1960–1964) that had a swing axle suspension design that was prone to 'tuck under' in certain circumstances. To compensate for the removal of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar) as a cost-cutting measure, Corvairs required tire pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15 psi front, 26 psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30 psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was dangerous over-steer.[233]\n\n\nIn early March 1966, several media outlets, including *The New Republic* and *The New York Times*, alleged that GM had tried to discredit Ralph Nader, hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past, and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.[234][235] Nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for $425,000. Nader's lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals, whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover \"overzealous surveillance\".[236] Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.\n\n\nA 1972 safety commission report conducted by Texas A&M University concluded that the 1960–1963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations.[237] The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of NHTSA testing from the previous year. NHTSA conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars — a Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, Volkswagen Beetle, and Renault Dauphine — along with a second-generation Corvair (with its completely redesigned, independent rear suspension). The 143-page report reviewed NHTSA's extreme-condition handling tests, national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors' internal documentation regarding the Corvair's handling.[238] NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests. This review panel concluded that 'the 1960–63 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests ... the handling and stability performance of the 1960–63 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic'.\n\n\nFormer GM executive John DeLorean asserted, in his book *On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors*, that Nader's criticisms were valid.[239]\n\n\nJournalist David E. Davis noted that despite Nader's claim that swing-axle rear suspension were dangerous, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era.[240]\n\n\n\n### Apartheid[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, GM (along with other multinational corporations) was sued by a group of South Africans represented by the Khulumani Support Group.[241] The plaintiffs alleged that the company provided vehicles to the South African security forces during the Apartheid. The company settled with the plaintiffs in 2012, agreeing to pay a sum of up to $1.5 million.[242]\n\n\n\n### Ignition switch recall[edit]\n\n\nMain article: General Motors ignition switch recalls\n\nIn May 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade, despite knowing there was a problem with the switches. General Motors paid compensation for 124 deaths linked to the faulty switches.[243] The $35 million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose.[244] The total cost of the recall was estimated to be $1.5 billion.[142] As well as the Cobalts, the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars, such as the Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion, the Chevrolet HHR, the Saturn Sky, and Pontiac Solstice. The recall involved about 2.6 million GM cars worldwide.[245]\n\n\n\n### Xinjiang region[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including General Motors, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang.[246]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Michigan portal\n* ![](image)Cars portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers\n* ASOTRECOL\n* Crucible Industries\n* EcoCAR\n* General Motors Hy-wire\n* General Motors proving grounds\n* General Motors Technical Center\n* GM people\n* GM vehicles by brand\n* List of automobile manufacturers of the United States\n* List of GM engines\n* List of General Motors factories\n* List of General Motors platforms\n* List of GM transmissions\n* United States Council for Automotive Research\n* VIA Motors\n* Freon\n* Global Climate Coalition\n* Ethyl Corporation\n* Durant Motors\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Department of State, Division of Corporations (General Information Name Search)\".

The company designs, manufactures, and distributes passenger and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, engines and turbomachinery, as well as offers related services, including financing, leasing, and fleet management. In 2016, it was the world's largest automaker by sales, and keeping this title in 2017, 2018, and 2019, selling 10.9 million vehicles.[7] It has maintained the largest market share in Europe for over two decades.[8] It ranked seventh in the 2020 *Fortune* Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[9]\n\n\nThe Volkswagen Group sells passenger cars under the Audi, Bentley, Cupra, Jetta, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, Škoda and Volkswagen brands, motorcycles under the Ducati name, light commercial vehicles under the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand, and heavy commercial vehicles via the marques of the listed subsidiary Traton (Navistar, MAN, Scania and Volkswagen Truck & Bus). It is divided into two primary divisions: the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division. As of 2008, it had about 342 subsidiary companies.[10] Volkswagen also has three joint ventures in China, FAW-Volkswagen, SAIC Volkswagen and Volkswagen Anhui.Audi The company has operations in roughly 150 countries, and it has 100 production facilities across 27 countries.\n\n\nVolkswagen was founded in Berlin in 1937 and incorporated in Wolfsburg to manufacture the car that would become known as the Beetle. The company's production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1965, it acquired Auto Union, which subsequently produced the first postwar Audi models. Volkswagen launched a new generation of front-wheel drive vehicles in the 1970s, including the Passat, Polo and Golf; the last became its bestseller. Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in SEAT in 1986, making it the first non-German marque of the company, and acquired control of Škoda in 1994, of Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti in 1998, Scania in 2008 and of Ducati, MAN, and Porsche in 2012. The company's operations in China have grown rapidly in the past decade, with the country becoming its largest market.\n\n\nVolkswagen Aktiengesellschaft is a public company and has a primary listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index, and a secondary listings on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and SIX Swiss Exchange. It has been traded in the United States via American depositary receipts since 1988, currently on the OTC Marketplace. Volkswagen delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2013.[11][12] The government of Lower Saxony holds 12.7% of the company's shares, granting it, by law, 20% of the voting rights.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)26 May 1938: Laying the foundation stone of the first Volkswagen plant by Adolf Hitler: In the front right is Ferdinand Porsche.\n### 1937 to 1945[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen (meaning 'People's car' in German) was founded in Berlin as the *Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH* ('Limited Liability Company for the preparation of the German People's Car', abbreviated to *Gezuvor*) by the National Socialist *Deutsche Arbeitsfront* (German Labour Front) and incorporated on 28 May 1937.[14][15][16] The purpose of the company was to manufacture the Volkswagen car, originally referred to as the Porsche Type 60, then the Volkswagen Type 1, and commonly called the Volkswagen Beetle.[17] This vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Porsche's consulting firm, and the company was backed by the support of Adolf Hitler.[18] On 16 September 1938, Gezuvor was renamed *Volkswagenwerk GmbH* ('Volkswagen Factory GmbH').[14]\n\n\nShortly after the factory near Fallersleben was completed, World War II started, and the plant primarily manufactured the military Kübelwagen (Porsche Type 82) and the related amphibious Schwimmwagen (Type 166), both of which were derived from the Volkswagen. Only a small number of Type 60 Volkswagens were made during this time. The Fallersleben plant also manufactured the V-1 flying bomb, making the plant a major bombing target for the Allied forces.\n\n\n\n### 1945 to 1970[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1951 Volkswagen Beetle\nAfter the war in Europe, in June 1945, Major Ivan Hirst[17] of the British Army Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) took control of the bomb-shattered factory for use in repairing British Army vehicles, pending the expected disposal of the plant tooling and equipment as war reparations. However, no British car manufacturer was interested. A British report on the car said that \"the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor-car … it is quite unattractive to the average buyer … To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.\"[19] In 1948, the Ford Motor Company of USA was offered Volkswagen, but Ernest Breech, a Ford executive vice president, said he did not think either the plant or the car was \"worth a damn.\"[20] Breech later said that he would have considered merging Ford of Germany and Volkswagen, but after the war, ownership of the company was in such dispute that nobody could possibly hope to be able to take it over. As part of the Industrial plans for Germany, large parts of German industry, including Volkswagen, were to be dismantled. Total German car production was set at a maximum of 10% of the 1936 car production numbers.[21] The company survived by producing cars for the British Army, and in 1948 the British Government handed the company back over to the German state, and it was managed by former Opel chief Heinrich Nordhoff.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Audi F103, in production from 1965 to 1972\nProduction of the Type 60 Volkswagen (re-designated Type 1) started slowly after the war due to the need to rebuild the plant and because of the lack of raw materials, but production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. The company began introducing new models based on the Type 1, all with the same basic air-cooled, rear-engine, rear-drive platform. These included the Volkswagen Type 2 in 1950, the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia in 1955, the Volkswagen Type 3 in 1961, the Volkswagen Type 4 in 1968, and the Volkswagen Type 181 in 1969.\n\n\nIn 1960, upon the flotation of part of the German federal government's stake in the company on the German stock market, its name became *Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft* (usually abbreviated to *Volkswagenwerk AG*).\n\n\nOn 1 January 1965, Volkswagenwerk acquired Auto Union GmbH from its parent company Daimler-Benz. The new subsidiary went on to produce the first post-war Audi models, the Audi F103 series, shortly afterwards.[22]\n\n\nAnother German manufacturer, NSU Motorenwerke AG, was merged into Auto Union on 26 August 1969, creating a new company, Audi NSU Auto Union AG (later renamed AUDI AG in 1985).[22]\n\n\n\n### 1970 to 1999[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Volkswagen Golf Mk1 - the Golf is the third-bestselling car of all time, selling over 30 million up to 2013.\nFrom the late 1970s to 1992, the acronym **V.A.G.** was used by Volkswagen AG as a brand for group-wide activities, such as distribution and leasing. Contrary to popular belief, \"V.A.G.\" had no official meaning, and was never the formal name of the Volkswagen Group.[23]\n\n\nOn 30 September 1982, Volkswagenwerk made its first step expanding outside Germany by signing a co-operation agreement with the Spanish car manufacturer SEAT, S.A.[22]\n\n\nTo reflect the company's increasing global diversification from its headquarters and main plant (the *Volkswagenwerk* in Wolfsburg), on 4 July 1985, the company name was changed again—to *Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft* (Volkswagen AG).\n\n\nOn 18 June 1986, Volkswagen AG acquired a 51% controlling stake in SEAT, making it the first non-German subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. On 23 December the same year, it became the Spanish company's major shareholder by increasing its share up to 75%.[22]\n\n\nIn 1990—after purchasing its entire equity—Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of SEAT, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary, and on 28 March 1991, another step to the expansion of the group's activities was made through the signing of a joint-venture partnership agreement with Škoda automobilová a.s. of Czechoslovakia, accompanied with the acquisition of a 30% stake in the Czech car manufacturer on 16 April 1991.[22]\n\n\nOn 19 December 1994, the group began the acquisition of Škoda Auto by raising its share to 60.3%. Later, on 11 December 1995, it became the Czech company's largest and controlling shareholder by increasing its share up to 70%.[24]\n\n\nThree prestige automotive marques were added to the Volkswagen portfolio in 1998: Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti.[22]\n\n\n\n### 2000 to present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Škoda Superb B6, in production from 2008 to 2015\nOn 30 May 2000, after having gradually raised its equity share, Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of Škoda Auto, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary.[22]\n\n\nFrom 2002 up to 2007, the Volkswagen Group's automotive division was restructured so that two major Brand Groups with different profile would be formed,[25] the *Audi Brand Group* focused on more sporty values – consisted of Audi, SEAT and Lamborghini – and the *Volkswagen Brand Group* on the field of classic values – consisted of Volkswagen, Skoda, Bentley and Bugatti[26][27] – with each Brand Group's product vehicles and performance being respectively under the higher responsibility of Audi and Volkswagen brands.\n\n\nVolkswagen Group revealed on 24 October 2009 that it had made an offer to acquire long-time partner and German niche automotive manufacturer Wilhelm Karmann GmbH out of bankruptcy protection.[28] In November 2009, the supervisory board of Volkswagen AG approved the acquisition of assets of Karmann, and planned to restart vehicle production at their Osnabrück plant in 2012.[29]\n\n\nIn December 2009, Volkswagen AG bought a 49.9% stake in Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (more commonly known as Porsche AG) in a first step towards an 'integrated automotive group' with Porsche.[30][31][32] The merger of Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE was scheduled to take place during the course of 2011. On 8 September 2011, it was announced that the planned merger \"cannot be implemented within the time frame provided for in the Comprehensive Agreement\". As reasons, unquantifiable legal risks, including a criminal probe into the holding's former management team were given. Both parties \"remain committed to the goal of creating an integrated automotive group with Porsche and are convinced that this will take place\".[33][34]\n\n\nOn 4 July 2012 Volkswagen group announced they would wrap up the remaining half of Porsche shares for 4.46 billion euros (US$5.58 billion) on 1 August 2012 to avoid taxes of as much as 1.5 billion euros, which would have to be paid if the wrap up happened after 31 July 2014.[35] Volkswagen AG purchased the remaining stake in Porsche AG equaling 100% of the shares in Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH, effectively becoming its parent company as of 1 August 2012.[36]\n\n\nVolkswagen AG completed the purchase of 19.9% of Suzuki Motor Corporation's issued shares on 15 January 2010.[37][38] Suzuki invested part of the amount received from Volkswagen into 1.49% percent of Volkswagen.[39] In 2011, Suzuki filed a lawsuit at an arbitration court in London requesting that Volkswagen return the 19.9% stake.[40]\n\n\nOn 25 May 2010, it was announced that Volkswagen Group, through it subsidiary Lamborghini Holding S.p.A., had acquired a 90.1% stake in the Italian automotive design house Italdesign Giugiaro.[41]\nIn less than three months, the transaction had been completed making the Italian firm a member of the Volkswagen Group.[42] Since 2013 the Volkswagen Group has held a 89.7% stake in Traton.\n\n\nIn 2015 research showed a security flaw in the keyless ignition of Volkswagen and other carmakers' vehicles. Volkswagen spent two years trying to keep the research from the public domain.[43][*undue weight? – discuss*]\n\n\nOn 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[44] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.\n\n\nVolkswagen held a 19.9% non-controlling shareholding in Suzuki between 2009 and 2015. An international arbitration court ordered Volkswagen to sell the stake back to Suzuki.[45] On 17 September 2015, Suzuki paid $3.8bn to complete the stock buy-back just hours prior to a major scandal about emissions violations engulfing Volkswagen. Suzuki had wished to buy Fiat diesel engines.[46]\n\n\nBugatti left the Volkswagen Group in November 2021, when the company became part of Bugatti Rimac, a joint venture between Rimac Group and Porsche AG.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Emissions scandal, 2015[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volkswagen emissions scandal\n\nOn 18 September 2015, the US EPA announced that Volkswagen had installed a \"defeat device\" software code in the diesel models sold in the US from 2009 to 2015.[48] The code was intended to detect when an emissions test was being conducted, and altered emissions controls for better compliance. Off the test stand, the controls were relaxed, and emissions jumped 35 to 40 times regulatory levels according to investigators at West Virginia University and the California Air Resources Board. About 482,000 vehicles are under the recall order, a potential $18 billion ($37,500 per violation) in fines are pending, and news accounts speculate a criminal indictment for the deception is certain.[49][50] The VW Group CEO, Martin Winterkorn, said he was \"deeply sorry\" and ordered an external investigation.[51] The software code was only revealed when the EPA refused to certify VW's 2016 models for sale in the US unless the corporation provided full disclosure.[52] On Sunday, 20 September 2015, VW Group announced it was halting the sale of its four-cylinder diesel models in the US.[53] The US EPA press release on its Notice of Violation,[48] and the California Air Resources Board letter[54] dated 18 September 2015 contain significant chronological detail of the agencies interaction with VW on the issue.\n\n\nOn 22 September 2015, VW AG admitted that 11 million cars worldwide had been fitted with software intended to deceive emissions testing. The company issued a profit warning, saying it had set aside $7 billion to fix the fraud.[55] On 23 September 2015, Martin Winterkorn announced his resignation from the CEO position after a crisis meeting of the company board.[56] On 25 September 2015 Matthias Müller was named CEO.[57] Müller was the head of the Porsche marque within the VW corporate umbrella.[58]\n\n\nOn 21 April 2017, a U.S. federal judge ordered Volkswagen \"to pay a $2.8 billion criminal fine for rigging diesel-powered vehicles to cheat on government emissions tests\". The \"unprecedented\" plea deal formalized a punishment that Volkswagen AG agreed to earlier in 2017.[59] In addition, the plea deal includes a $1.5 billion settlement for various environmental, customs and financial violations.[60]\n\n\nOverall, Volkswagen will pay more than $30 billion in penalties and lawsuit settlements related to the scandal.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Electrification strategy 2025[edit]\n\n\n![](image)VW Group has invested in a wide-ranging electrification strategy in Europe, North America and China, with its electric \"MEB\" platform.\nIn 2016, Volkswagen Group announced a corporate \"Strategy 2025\" that focuses on electrification of its portfolio.[62] The VW Group developed the Volkswagen Group MEB platform chassis that will be utilized in a range of various cars and light utility vehicles across several VW Group marques due to its flexibility and floor-mounted battery.[63]\n\n\nAs of May 2018, the VW Group has committed $48 billion in car battery supplies[64] and plans to outfit 16 factories to build electric cars by the end of 2022.[65] According to VW Group CEO Dr. Herbert Diess, the company will offer 25 electric models and 20 plug-in hybrids by 2020.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Production in Xinjiang[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen Group came under pressure for cooperating with the Chinese government in the region of Xinjiang. In that same region, western-funded NGOs accused the Chinese government of having committed human rights abuses against the Uighur minority group, which included mass surveillance, incarceration, and forced labor. After these accusations emerged, Volkswagen responded, \"We do not assume any of our employees are forced laborers.\"[66] *Süddeutsche Zeitung* claimed that Volkswagen was operating a plant in Xinjiang at a loss in order to curry favor with the Chinese government to set up more lucrative plants in other parts of China, which Volkswagen denied, saying that the decision to set up the plant in 2012 was purely based on economics.[66] Volkswagen is still operating a plant in the region as of 2020.[67]\n\n\n\n#### New Auto[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Volkswagen Group released their *New Auto* strategy. The strategy was based on transitioning to electric cars, and building a shared platform, battery systems, software and mobility solutions to use across all their brands.[68][69] This involves creating the Scalable Systems Platform, as well as developing software under a new subsidiary called *CARIAD*.[68][69] Volkswagen Group aims by 2024 to transition to selling mostly electric cars.[70] It aims to have six battery factories in Europe by 2030.[70]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2018, Volkswagen reported earnings of €13.920 billion, with an annual revenue of €235.849 billion, an increase of 2.2% over the previous fiscal cycle. Volkswagen's shares traded at over €148 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$73.8 billion in November 2018.[71]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein bn. EUR€[72] | Net incomein bn.

Analysts disagreed as to whether the investment was a good fit for Porsche's strategy.[89]\n\n\nOn 26 March 2007, after the European Union moved against the Volkswagen law, Porsche took its holding to 30.9 percent, triggering a takeover bid under German law. Porsche formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen Group, setting its offer price at the lowest possible legal value, but intended the move to avoid a competitor taking a large stake, or to stop hedge funds dismantling Volkswagen Group, which is Porsche's most important partner.[90]\nOn 16 September 2008, Porsche announced that the company had increased its stake in Volkswagen AG to 35 percent.[91] By October 2008, Porsche held 42.6 percent of Volkswagen AG's ordinary shares, and held stock options on another 31.5 percent.[92] thus, effectively holding over 74 percent; 42.6 percent actual shares, and the rest as convertible options.[93] Volkswagen AG briefly became the world's most valuable company, as the stock price rose to over €1,000 per share as short sellers tried to cover their positions.[94] The substantial investment in Volkswagen left Porsche with huge financial burden with its debts accumulating up to 13 billion euros by 2009.[95] Porsche would get emergency infusion of about a billion dollars from Volkswagen.[96] In July 2012, Volkswagen completed takeover of Porsche ending the 4 year saga and formed an integrated automotive group with Porsche. Porsche AG would become the 10th brand of Volkswagen. The holding company Porsche SE was left with 31 percent of the subscribed capital of Volkswagen AG, and 50.7 percent of the voting rights in the company.[97]\n\n\nAs of 31 December 2020[update], share ownership of Volkswagen AG is distributed as follows:[98]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nSubscribed capital:\n| Percentage | Shareholder name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 31.4% | Porsche Automobil Holding SE |\n| 25.9% | Foreign institutional investors |\n| 14.6% | Qatar Holding LLC |\n| 11.8% | State of Lower Saxony |\n| 12.9% | Private shareholders / Others\n |\n| 3.4% | German institutional investors\n |\n\n | \n\nVoting rights:\n| Percentage | Shareholder name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 53.3% | Porsche Automobil Holding SE |\n| 20.0% | State of Lower Saxony |\n| 17.0% | Qatar Holding LLC |\n| 9.7% | Others\n |\n\n\n |\n\n### Stock market listings[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen AG shares are primarily traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,[99] and are listed under the 'VOW' and 'VOW3' stock ticker symbols. First listed in August 1961, the shares were issued at a price of DM 350 per DM 100 share,[99] Volkswagen AG shares are now separated into two different types or classes: 'ordinary shares' and 'preference shares'.[99] The ordinary shares are now traded under the WKN 766400 and ISIN DE0007664005 listings, and the preference shares under the WKN 766403 and ISIN DE0007664039 listings.[99]\n\n\nVolkswagen AG shares are also listed and traded on other major domestic and worldwide stock exchanges.

The company designs, manufactures, and distributes passenger and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, engines and turbomachinery, as well as offers related services, including financing, leasing, and fleet management. In 2016, it was the world's largest automaker by sales, and keeping this title in 2017, 2018, and 2019, selling 10.9 million vehicles.[7] It has maintained the largest market share in Europe for over two decades.[8] It ranked seventh in the 2020 *Fortune* Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[9]\n\n\nThe Volkswagen Group sells passenger cars under the Audi, Bentley, Cupra, Jetta, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, Škoda and Volkswagen brands, motorcycles under the Ducati name, light commercial vehicles under the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand, and heavy commercial vehicles via the marques of the listed subsidiary Traton (Navistar, MAN, Scania and Volkswagen Truck & Bus). It is divided into two primary divisions: the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division. As of 2008, it had about 342 subsidiary companies.[10] Volkswagen also has three joint ventures in China, FAW-Volkswagen, SAIC Volkswagen and Volkswagen Anhui.Audi The company has operations in roughly 150 countries, and it has 100 production facilities across 27 countries.\n\n\nVolkswagen was founded in Berlin in 1937 and incorporated in Wolfsburg to manufacture the car that would become known as the Beetle. The company's production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1965, it acquired Auto Union, which subsequently produced the first postwar Audi models. Volkswagen launched a new generation of front-wheel drive vehicles in the 1970s, including the Passat, Polo and Golf; the last became its bestseller. Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in SEAT in 1986, making it the first non-German marque of the company, and acquired control of Škoda in 1994, of Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti in 1998, Scania in 2008 and of Ducati, MAN, and Porsche in 2012. The company's operations in China have grown rapidly in the past decade, with the country becoming its largest market.\n\n\nVolkswagen Aktiengesellschaft is a public company and has a primary listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index, and a secondary listings on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and SIX Swiss Exchange. It has been traded in the United States via American depositary receipts since 1988, currently on the OTC Marketplace. Volkswagen delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2013.[11][12] The government of Lower Saxony holds 12.7% of the company's shares, granting it, by law, 20% of the voting rights.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)26 May 1938: Laying the foundation stone of the first Volkswagen plant by Adolf Hitler: In the front right is Ferdinand Porsche.\n### 1937 to 1945[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen (meaning 'People's car' in German) was founded in Berlin as the *Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH* ('Limited Liability Company for the preparation of the German People's Car', abbreviated to *Gezuvor*) by the National Socialist *Deutsche Arbeitsfront* (German Labour Front) and incorporated on 28 May 1937.[14][15][16] The purpose of the company was to manufacture the Volkswagen car, originally referred to as the Porsche Type 60, then the Volkswagen Type 1, and commonly called the Volkswagen Beetle.[17] This vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Porsche's consulting firm, and the company was backed by the support of Adolf Hitler.[18] On 16 September 1938, Gezuvor was renamed *Volkswagenwerk GmbH* ('Volkswagen Factory GmbH').[14]\n\n\nShortly after the factory near Fallersleben was completed, World War II started, and the plant primarily manufactured the military Kübelwagen (Porsche Type 82) and the related amphibious Schwimmwagen (Type 166), both of which were derived from the Volkswagen. Only a small number of Type 60 Volkswagens were made during this time. The Fallersleben plant also manufactured the V-1 flying bomb, making the plant a major bombing target for the Allied forces.\n\n\n\n### 1945 to 1970[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1951 Volkswagen Beetle\nAfter the war in Europe, in June 1945, Major Ivan Hirst[17] of the British Army Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) took control of the bomb-shattered factory for use in repairing British Army vehicles, pending the expected disposal of the plant tooling and equipment as war reparations. However, no British car manufacturer was interested. A British report on the car said that \"the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor-car … it is quite unattractive to the average buyer … To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.\"[19] In 1948, the Ford Motor Company of USA was offered Volkswagen, but Ernest Breech, a Ford executive vice president, said he did not think either the plant or the car was \"worth a damn.\"[20] Breech later said that he would have considered merging Ford of Germany and Volkswagen, but after the war, ownership of the company was in such dispute that nobody could possibly hope to be able to take it over. As part of the Industrial plans for Germany, large parts of German industry, including Volkswagen, were to be dismantled. Total German car production was set at a maximum of 10% of the 1936 car production numbers.[21] The company survived by producing cars for the British Army, and in 1948 the British Government handed the company back over to the German state, and it was managed by former Opel chief Heinrich Nordhoff.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Audi F103, in production from 1965 to 1972\nProduction of the Type 60 Volkswagen (re-designated Type 1) started slowly after the war due to the need to rebuild the plant and because of the lack of raw materials, but production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. The company began introducing new models based on the Type 1, all with the same basic air-cooled, rear-engine, rear-drive platform. These included the Volkswagen Type 2 in 1950, the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia in 1955, the Volkswagen Type 3 in 1961, the Volkswagen Type 4 in 1968, and the Volkswagen Type 181 in 1969.\n\n\nIn 1960, upon the flotation of part of the German federal government's stake in the company on the German stock market, its name became *Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft* (usually abbreviated to *Volkswagenwerk AG*).\n\n\nOn 1 January 1965, Volkswagenwerk acquired Auto Union GmbH from its parent company Daimler-Benz. The new subsidiary went on to produce the first post-war Audi models, the Audi F103 series, shortly afterwards.[22]\n\n\nAnother German manufacturer, NSU Motorenwerke AG, was merged into Auto Union on 26 August 1969, creating a new company, Audi NSU Auto Union AG (later renamed AUDI AG in 1985).[22]\n\n\n\n### 1970 to 1999[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Volkswagen Golf Mk1 - the Golf is the third-bestselling car of all time, selling over 30 million up to 2013.\nFrom the late 1970s to 1992, the acronym **V.A.G.** was used by Volkswagen AG as a brand for group-wide activities, such as distribution and leasing. Contrary to popular belief, \"V.A.G.\" had no official meaning, and was never the formal name of the Volkswagen Group.[23]\n\n\nOn 30 September 1982, Volkswagenwerk made its first step expanding outside Germany by signing a co-operation agreement with the Spanish car manufacturer SEAT, S.A.[22]\n\n\nTo reflect the company's increasing global diversification from its headquarters and main plant (the *Volkswagenwerk* in Wolfsburg), on 4 July 1985, the company name was changed again—to *Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft* (Volkswagen AG).\n\n\nOn 18 June 1986, Volkswagen AG acquired a 51% controlling stake in SEAT, making it the first non-German subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. On 23 December the same year, it became the Spanish company's major shareholder by increasing its share up to 75%.[22]\n\n\nIn 1990—after purchasing its entire equity—Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of SEAT, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary, and on 28 March 1991, another step to the expansion of the group's activities was made through the signing of a joint-venture partnership agreement with Škoda automobilová a.s. of Czechoslovakia, accompanied with the acquisition of a 30% stake in the Czech car manufacturer on 16 April 1991.[22]\n\n\nOn 19 December 1994, the group began the acquisition of Škoda Auto by raising its share to 60.3%. Later, on 11 December 1995, it became the Czech company's largest and controlling shareholder by increasing its share up to 70%.[24]\n\n\nThree prestige automotive marques were added to the Volkswagen portfolio in 1998: Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti.[22]\n\n\n\n### 2000 to present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Škoda Superb B6, in production from 2008 to 2015\nOn 30 May 2000, after having gradually raised its equity share, Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of Škoda Auto, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary.[22]\n\n\nFrom 2002 up to 2007, the Volkswagen Group's automotive division was restructured so that two major Brand Groups with different profile would be formed,[25] the *Audi Brand Group* focused on more sporty values – consisted of Audi, SEAT and Lamborghini – and the *Volkswagen Brand Group* on the field of classic values – consisted of Volkswagen, Skoda, Bentley and Bugatti[26][27] – with each Brand Group's product vehicles and performance being respectively under the higher responsibility of Audi and Volkswagen brands.\n\n\nVolkswagen Group revealed on 24 October 2009 that it had made an offer to acquire long-time partner and German niche automotive manufacturer Wilhelm Karmann GmbH out of bankruptcy protection.[28] In November 2009, the supervisory board of Volkswagen AG approved the acquisition of assets of Karmann, and planned to restart vehicle production at their Osnabrück plant in 2012.[29]\n\n\nIn December 2009, Volkswagen AG bought a 49.9% stake in Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (more commonly known as Porsche AG) in a first step towards an 'integrated automotive group' with Porsche.[30][31][32] The merger of Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE was scheduled to take place during the course of 2011. On 8 September 2011, it was announced that the planned merger \"cannot be implemented within the time frame provided for in the Comprehensive Agreement\". As reasons, unquantifiable legal risks, including a criminal probe into the holding's former management team were given. Both parties \"remain committed to the goal of creating an integrated automotive group with Porsche and are convinced that this will take place\".[33][34]\n\n\nOn 4 July 2012 Volkswagen group announced they would wrap up the remaining half of Porsche shares for 4.46 billion euros (US$5.58 billion) on 1 August 2012 to avoid taxes of as much as 1.5 billion euros, which would have to be paid if the wrap up happened after 31 July 2014.[35] Volkswagen AG purchased the remaining stake in Porsche AG equaling 100% of the shares in Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH, effectively becoming its parent company as of 1 August 2012.[36]\n\n\nVolkswagen AG completed the purchase of 19.9% of Suzuki Motor Corporation's issued shares on 15 January 2010.[37][38] Suzuki invested part of the amount received from Volkswagen into 1.49% percent of Volkswagen.[39] In 2011, Suzuki filed a lawsuit at an arbitration court in London requesting that Volkswagen return the 19.9% stake.[40]\n\n\nOn 25 May 2010, it was announced that Volkswagen Group, through it subsidiary Lamborghini Holding S.p.A., had acquired a 90.1% stake in the Italian automotive design house Italdesign Giugiaro.[41]\nIn less than three months, the transaction had been completed making the Italian firm a member of the Volkswagen Group.[42] Since 2013 the Volkswagen Group has held a 89.7% stake in Traton.\n\n\nIn 2015 research showed a security flaw in the keyless ignition of Volkswagen and other carmakers' vehicles. Volkswagen spent two years trying to keep the research from the public domain.[43][*undue weight? – discuss*]\n\n\nOn 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion.[44] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.\n\n\nVolkswagen held a 19.9% non-controlling shareholding in Suzuki between 2009 and 2015. An international arbitration court ordered Volkswagen to sell the stake back to Suzuki.[45] On 17 September 2015, Suzuki paid $3.8bn to complete the stock buy-back just hours prior to a major scandal about emissions violations engulfing Volkswagen. Suzuki had wished to buy Fiat diesel engines.[46]\n\n\nBugatti left the Volkswagen Group in November 2021, when the company became part of Bugatti Rimac, a joint venture between Rimac Group and Porsche AG.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Emissions scandal, 2015[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volkswagen emissions scandal\n\nOn 18 September 2015, the US EPA announced that Volkswagen had installed a \"defeat device\" software code in the diesel models sold in the US from 2009 to 2015.[48] The code was intended to detect when an emissions test was being conducted, and altered emissions controls for better compliance. Off the test stand, the controls were relaxed, and emissions jumped 35 to 40 times regulatory levels according to investigators at West Virginia University and the California Air Resources Board. About 482,000 vehicles are under the recall order, a potential $18 billion ($37,500 per violation) in fines are pending, and news accounts speculate a criminal indictment for the deception is certain.[49][50] The VW Group CEO, Martin Winterkorn, said he was \"deeply sorry\" and ordered an external investigation.[51] The software code was only revealed when the EPA refused to certify VW's 2016 models for sale in the US unless the corporation provided full disclosure.[52] On Sunday, 20 September 2015, VW Group announced it was halting the sale of its four-cylinder diesel models in the US.[53] The US EPA press release on its Notice of Violation,[48] and the California Air Resources Board letter[54] dated 18 September 2015 contain significant chronological detail of the agencies interaction with VW on the issue.\n\n\nOn 22 September 2015, VW AG admitted that 11 million cars worldwide had been fitted with software intended to deceive emissions testing. The company issued a profit warning, saying it had set aside $7 billion to fix the fraud.[55] On 23 September 2015, Martin Winterkorn announced his resignation from the CEO position after a crisis meeting of the company board.[56] On 25 September 2015 Matthias Müller was named CEO.[57] Müller was the head of the Porsche marque within the VW corporate umbrella.[58]\n\n\nOn 21 April 2017, a U.S. federal judge ordered Volkswagen \"to pay a $2.8 billion criminal fine for rigging diesel-powered vehicles to cheat on government emissions tests\". The \"unprecedented\" plea deal formalized a punishment that Volkswagen AG agreed to earlier in 2017.[59] In addition, the plea deal includes a $1.5 billion settlement for various environmental, customs and financial violations.[60]\n\n\nOverall, Volkswagen will pay more than $30 billion in penalties and lawsuit settlements related to the scandal.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Electrification strategy 2025[edit]\n\n\n![](image)VW Group has invested in a wide-ranging electrification strategy in Europe, North America and China, with its electric \"MEB\" platform.\nIn 2016, Volkswagen Group announced a corporate \"Strategy 2025\" that focuses on electrification of its portfolio.[62] The VW Group developed the Volkswagen Group MEB platform chassis that will be utilized in a range of various cars and light utility vehicles across several VW Group marques due to its flexibility and floor-mounted battery.[63]\n\n\nAs of May 2018, the VW Group has committed $48 billion in car battery supplies[64] and plans to outfit 16 factories to build electric cars by the end of 2022.[65] According to VW Group CEO Dr. Herbert Diess, the company will offer 25 electric models and 20 plug-in hybrids by 2020.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Production in Xinjiang[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen Group came under pressure for cooperating with the Chinese government in the region of Xinjiang. In that same region, western-funded NGOs accused the Chinese government of having committed human rights abuses against the Uighur minority group, which included mass surveillance, incarceration, and forced labor. After these accusations emerged, Volkswagen responded, \"We do not assume any of our employees are forced laborers.\"[66] *Süddeutsche Zeitung* claimed that Volkswagen was operating a plant in Xinjiang at a loss in order to curry favor with the Chinese government to set up more lucrative plants in other parts of China, which Volkswagen denied, saying that the decision to set up the plant in 2012 was purely based on economics.[66] Volkswagen is still operating a plant in the region as of 2020.[67]\n\n\n\n#### New Auto[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Volkswagen Group released their *New Auto* strategy. The strategy was based on transitioning to electric cars, and building a shared platform, battery systems, software and mobility solutions to use across all their brands.[68][69] This involves creating the Scalable Systems Platform, as well as developing software under a new subsidiary called *CARIAD*.[68][69] Volkswagen Group aims by 2024 to transition to selling mostly electric cars.[70] It aims to have six battery factories in Europe by 2030.[70]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2018, Volkswagen reported earnings of €13.920 billion, with an annual revenue of €235.849 billion, an increase of 2.2% over the previous fiscal cycle. Volkswagen's shares traded at over €148 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$73.8 billion in November 2018.[71]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein bn. EUR€[72] | Net incomein bn.

Analysts disagreed as to whether the investment was a good fit for Porsche's strategy.[89]\n\n\nOn 26 March 2007, after the European Union moved against the Volkswagen law, Porsche took its holding to 30.9 percent, triggering a takeover bid under German law. Porsche formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen Group, setting its offer price at the lowest possible legal value, but intended the move to avoid a competitor taking a large stake, or to stop hedge funds dismantling Volkswagen Group, which is Porsche's most important partner.[90]\nOn 16 September 2008, Porsche announced that the company had increased its stake in Volkswagen AG to 35 percent.[91] By October 2008, Porsche held 42.6 percent of Volkswagen AG's ordinary shares, and held stock options on another 31.5 percent.[92] thus, effectively holding over 74 percent; 42.6 percent actual shares, and the rest as convertible options.[93] Volkswagen AG briefly became the world's most valuable company, as the stock price rose to over €1,000 per share as short sellers tried to cover their positions.[94] The substantial investment in Volkswagen left Porsche with huge financial burden with its debts accumulating up to 13 billion euros by 2009.[95] Porsche would get emergency infusion of about a billion dollars from Volkswagen.[96] In July 2012, Volkswagen completed takeover of Porsche ending the 4 year saga and formed an integrated automotive group with Porsche. Porsche AG would become the 10th brand of Volkswagen. The holding company Porsche SE was left with 31 percent of the subscribed capital of Volkswagen AG, and 50.7 percent of the voting rights in the company.[97]\n\n\nAs of 31 December 2020[update], share ownership of Volkswagen AG is distributed as follows:[98]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nSubscribed capital:\n| Percentage | Shareholder name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 31.4% | Porsche Automobil Holding SE |\n| 25.9% | Foreign institutional investors |\n| 14.6% | Qatar Holding LLC |\n| 11.8% | State of Lower Saxony |\n| 12.9% | Private shareholders / Others\n |\n| 3.4% | German institutional investors\n |\n\n | \n\nVoting rights:\n| Percentage | Shareholder name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 53.3% | Porsche Automobil Holding SE |\n| 20.0% | State of Lower Saxony |\n| 17.0% | Qatar Holding LLC |\n| 9.7% | Others\n |\n\n\n |\n\n### Stock market listings[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen AG shares are primarily traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,[99] and are listed under the 'VOW' and 'VOW3' stock ticker symbols. First listed in August 1961, the shares were issued at a price of DM 350 per DM 100 share,[99] Volkswagen AG shares are now separated into two different types or classes: 'ordinary shares' and 'preference shares'.[99] The ordinary shares are now traded under the WKN 766400 and ISIN DE0007664005 listings, and the preference shares under the WKN 766403 and ISIN DE0007664039 listings.[99]\n\n\nVolkswagen AG shares are also listed and traded on other major domestic and worldwide stock exchanges. In Germany's domestic exchanges, since 1961 these include those in Berlin, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich and Stuttgart. International exchanges include those in Basel (listed in 1967), Geneva (1967), Zürich (1967), Luxembourg (1979), London (1988), and New York (1988).[99]\n\n\nSince the start of trading in 1961, Volkswagen AG shares have been subjected to two stock splits – the first was on 17 March 1969 when they were split at a ratio of 2:1, from a DM 100 share to a DM 50 share. The second split occurred on 6 July 1998, the DM 50 share being converted into a share of no overall nominal value, at a ratio of 1:10.[99]\n\n\nFrom 23 December 2009, Volkswagen AG preferred shares replaced its ordinary shares in the DAX index.[100]\n\n\n\n### Leadership, sales and market share[edit]\n\n\n\n\nVolkswagen (mbH, GmbH, AG) leaders\n| Tenure | Leader(s)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1937 to 1945 | Bodo Lafferentz, Ferdinand Porsche, Jakob Werlin[101] |\n| June 1945 to December 1947 | Ivan Hirst (Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers)[17] |\n| 1 January 1948 to April 1967 | Heinrich Nordhoff[102] |\n| 1 May 1968 to September 1971 | Kurt Lotz[102] |\n| 1 October 1971 to February 1975 | Rudolf Leiding[102] |\n| 10 February 1975 to December 1980 | Toni Schmücker[102] |\n| 1 January 1982 to December 1992 | Carl Hahn[102] |\n| 1 January 1993 to 16 April 2002 | Ferdinand K.

Currently, the company owns 33.88 percent of Kia Corporation,[5] and also fully owns two marques including its luxury cars subsidiary, Genesis, and an electric vehicle sub-brand, Ioniq.[6][7][8] Those three brands altogether comprise the Hyundai Motor Group.\n\n\nHyundai operates the world's largest integrated automobile manufacturing facility in Ulsan, South Korea which has an annual production capacity of 1.6 million units.[9] The company employs about 75,000 people worldwide. Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through 5,000 dealerships and showrooms.[10] As of 2022, Hyundai is the world's third-largest carmaker in terms of production, behind Toyota and Volkswagen.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1982 Hyundai Pony\nChung Ju-yung (1915–2001) founded the Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company in 1947. Hyundai Motor Company was later established in 1967, and the company's first model, the Cortina, was released in cooperation with Ford Motor Company in 1968.[12] When Hyundai wanted to develop their own car, they hired George Turnbull in February 1974, the former managing director of Austin Morris at British Leyland. He in turn hired five other top British car engineers. They were body designer Kenneth Barnett, engineers John Simpson and Edward Chapman, John Crosthwaite, formerly of BRM, as chassis engineer and Peter Slater as chief development engineer.[13][14][15][16] In 1975, the Pony, the first South Korean car, was released, with styling by Giorgio Giugiaro of Italdesign and powertrain technology provided by Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. Exports began in the following year to Ecuador and soon thereafter to the Benelux countries. Hyundai entered the British market in 1982, selling 2993 cars in their first year there.[17]\n\n\nIn 1984, Hyundai began exporting the Pony to Canada, but not to the United States, as the Pony would not pass emissions standards there. Canadian sales greatly exceeded expectations, and it was at one point the top-selling car on the Canadian market. In 1985, the one millionth Hyundai car was built.[18] Until the 1986 introduction of the larger Hyundai Grandeur, Hyundai offered a locally assembled Ford Granada for the South Korean executive market. The import of these knocked down kits was permitted as long as Hyundai exported five cars for every single Granada brought in (the same demands were placed on Kia).[19]\n\n\nIn 1986, Hyundai began to sell cars in the United States, and the Excel was nominated as \"Best Product #10\" by *Fortune* magazine, largely because of its affordability. The company began to produce models with its own technology in 1988, beginning with the midsize Sonata. In the spring of 1990, aggregate production of Hyundai automobiles reached the four million mark.[18] In 1991, the company succeeded in developing its first proprietary gasoline engine, the four-cylinder Alpha, and also its own transmission, thus paving the way for technological independence.\n\n\nIn 1996, Hyundai Motor India Limited was established with a production plant in Irungattukottai near Chennai, India.[20]\n\n\nIn 1998, Hyundai began to overhaul its image in an attempt to establish itself as a world-class brand. Chung Ju-yung transferred leadership of Hyundai Motor to his son, Chung Mong-koo, in 1999.[21] Hyundai's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, invested heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. It added a 10-year or 100,000-mile (160,000 km) warranty to cars sold in the United States and launched an aggressive marketing campaign.\n\n\nIn 2004, Hyundai was ranked second in \"initial quality\" in a survey/study by J.D. Power and Associates in North America.[22][23] Hyundai is now one of the top 100 most valuable brands worldwide according to Interbrand.[24] Since 2002, Hyundai has also been one of the worldwide official sponsors of the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nIn 2006, the South Korean government initiated an investigation of Chung Mong-koo's practices as head of Hyundai, suspecting him of corruption. On 28 April 2006, Chung was arrested, and charged for embezzlement of 100 billion South Korean won (US$106 million).[25] As a result, Hyundai vice chairman and CEO, Kim Dong-jin, replaced him as head of the company.\n\n\nOn 30 September 2011, Yang Seung-suk announced his retirement as CEO of Hyundai Motor Co. In the interim replacement period, Chung Mong-koo and Kim Eok-jo divided the duties of the CEO position.[26]\n\n\nIn 2014, Hyundai started an initiative to focus on improving vehicle dynamics in its vehicles and hired Albert Biermann, former Vice President of Engineering at BMW M, to direct chassis development for Hyundai vehicles, stating: \"The company intends to become a technical leader in ride and handling, producing vehicles that lead their respective segments for driver engagement.\"[27]\n\n\nOn 14 October 2020, Euisun Chung was inaugurated as the new chairman of the Hyundai Motor Group. His father, Chung Mong-koo, has been made Honorary Chairman.[28]\n\n\nIn April 2021, the company said that its profits rose by 187%, the highest rise in four years. The company recorded a profit of $1.16 billion from the beginning of 2021 until March.[29]\n\n\n\n### Research and development[edit]\n\n\nHyundai has six research and development centers, located in South Korea (three offices), Germany, Japan and India. Additionally, a center in California develops designs for the United States.[30]\n\n\nHyundai established the Hyundai Design Center in Fountain Valley, California in 1990. The center moved to a new $30 million facility in Irvine, California in 2003, and was renamed the Hyundai Kia Motors Design and Technical Center. The facility also housed Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc, a subsidiary responsible for all engineering activities in the U.S. for Hyundai. Hyundai America Technical Center moved to its new 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2), $117 million headquarters in Superior Township, Michigan (near Ann Arbor) in 2005.[31]\n\n\nIn 2004, Hyundai America Technical Center completed construction of its Hyundai/Kia proving ground in California City, California. The 4,300-acre (17 km2) facility is located in the Mojave Desert and features a 6.4-mile (10.3 km) oval track,[9] a Vehicle Dynamics Area, a vehicle-handling course inside the oval track, a paved hill road, and several special surface roads. A 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) complex featuring offices and indoor testing areas is located on the premises as well. The facility was built at a cost of $50 million.\n\n\nIn the 2021 review of WIPO's annual World Intellectual Property Indicators Hyundai ranked as 4th in the world for its 141 industrial design registrations being published under the Hague System during 2020.[32] This position is up on their previous 7th-place ranking for 57 industrial design registrations being published in 2019.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Business[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai Motor Group\n\n![](image)The world's largest automobile manufacturing plant in Ulsan, South Korea, produces over 1.6 million vehicles annually.In 1998, after a shake-up in the South Korean auto industry caused by overambitious expansion and the Asian financial crisis, Hyundai acquired the majority of rival Kia Motors.[35]\n\n\nIn 2000, the company established a strategic alliance with DaimlerChrysler and severed its partnership with the Hyundai Group. In 2001, the Daimler-Hyundai Truck Corporation was formed. In 2004, however, DaimlerChrysler divested its interest in the company by selling its 10.5% stake for $900 million.\n\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Motor America headquarters in Fountain Valley, California\nHyundai has invested in manufacturing plants in North America, India, the Czech Republic, Russia, China and Turkey as well as research and development centers in Europe, Asia, North America and the Pacific Rim. In 2004, Hyundai Motor Company had $57.2 billion in sales in South Korea making it the country's second largest corporation, or chaebol, after Samsung. Worldwide sales in 2005 reached 2,533,695 units, an 11 percent increase over the previous year. In 2011, Hyundai sold 4.05 million cars worldwide and the Hyundai Motor Group was the world's fourth largest automaker behind GM, Volkswagen and Toyota.[36][37] Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through some 5,000 dealerships.\n\n\nIn February 2021, CNBC reported that Apple and Hyundai-Kia are close to finalizing a deal to build an autonomous Apple car. The vehicle was said to be completely designed by Apple and would be built in Hyundai or Kia plants, and could potentially go into production in 2024.[38] However, Hyundai Motor announced shortly after that it is no longer in talks with Apple.[39][40]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Hyundai Motor Group completed its acquisition of a controlling interest in the robotics firm, Boston Dynamics. Hyundai Motor Group now takes an 80% share of the company.[41]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong Koo (right) sitting next to South Korean president Park Geun-hye in 2013\n* Chung Eui-sun, Executive Chairman of Hyundai Motors\n* Chang Jae-hoon, President and CEO of Hyundai Motors\n* Lee Dong-seock, Vice President\n* Jose Munoz, Global COO\n* Gang Hyun-seo, Executive Vice President\n* Yoon Chi-won, Former Chairman of EQONEX\n* Eugene M.

Bürkle had previously worked for BMW, having designed the BMW 3 Series (E46), and the BMW 6 Series (E63).[42][43] Hyundai's current design philosophy is known as *Fluidic Sculpture*,[44] which is heavily inspired by nature.[45]\n\n\nIn 2018, the company announced the *Sensuous Sportiness* next-generation design direction. The design philosophy was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show demonstrated by the Le Fil Rouge concept car, and has been rolled out into their recent models, ranging from sedans to SUVs.[46] The *Sensuous Sportiness* design identity and strategy has won Design Management Institute's (DMI) Design Value Award 2020.[47]\n\n\n\n## Regional operations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Hyundai Motor Company manufacturing facilities\n\n\n\n| Top 8 Hyundai and Genesis vehicleproduction by country, 2021[48] |\n| --- |\n| Rank\n | Country\n | Vehicleproduction\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) South Korea | 1,646,888\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image) India | 635,413\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) China | 360,565\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) United States | 288,967\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) Czech Republic | 275,620\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image) Russia | 235,157\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image) Brazil | 188,349\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image) Turkey | 161,500\n |\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor America\n\n![](image)Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nHyundai Motor America began selling cars in the United States on 20 February 1986, with a single model, the Hyundai Excel. That year, Hyundai set a record of selling the most automobiles in its first year of business in the United States compared to any other car brand; total sales in 1986 were 168,882.[49]\n\n\nInitially well received, the Excel's faults soon became apparent; cost-cutting measures caused reliability to suffer. With an increasingly poor reputation for quality, Hyundai sales plummeted, and many dealerships either earned their profits on repairs or abandoned the product. At one point, Hyundai became the butt of many jokes (i.e. Hyundai stands for \"Hope you understand nothing's driveable and inexpensive\").[50]\n\n\nIn response, Hyundai began investing heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. The company added free maintenance for the first 2 years or 24,000 miles for all its new cars sold, starting with the 1992 model year. It also added a 10-year or 100,000-mile (160,000 km) powertrain warranty (known as the Hyundai Advantage) to its vehicles sold in the United States, it is now known as the America Best Warranty.[51]\n\n\nHyundai incorporated a new manufacturing facility, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, in April 2002. The new plant in Montgomery, Alabama, was completed during 2004, at a cost of $1.7 billion. Production started in May 2005. It employed more than 3,000 workers in 2012.[52]\n\n\nBy 2004, sales had dramatically increased, and the reputation of Hyundai cars improved. In 2004, Hyundai tied with Honda for initial brand quality in a survey/study from J.D. Power and Associates, for having 102 problems per 1000 vehicles. This made Hyundai second in the industry, only behind Toyota, for initial vehicle quality. The company continued this tradition by placing third overall in J.D. Power's 2006 Initial Quality Survey, behind only Porsche and Lexus.[53]\n\n\nIn 2009, the Hyundai Genesis luxury sedan was named 2009 North American Car of the Year, the first for Hyundai.[54] The model has received a number of well-recognized automobile awards worldwide. It also won the 2009 Canadian Car of the Year after winning its category of Best New Luxury Car under $50,000.[55] The Hyundai's V8 Tau engine in the Genesis received 2009 Ward's 10 Best Engines award.[56]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the Hyundai Elantra was named the North American Car of the Year at the North American International Auto Show, selling more than 200,000 cars since the model's redesigned debut.[57]\n\n\nAn urban air mobility (UAM) subsidiary called *Supernal* was established in 2020.[58][59] The name means 'Best Quality' and 'Heavenly'.[60] On November 8, 2023, Hyundai announced that a new plant will be built in the United States to produce flying taxis for commuters. They are targeting a test flight as early as December 2024. [61]\n\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Auto Canada office in Markham\nThe second-generation Hyundai Pony was available for sale in Canada starting with the 1984 model year. The Canadian Pony differed from its European counterparts by having 8 km/h bumpers, sealed-beam headlights, side marker lamps, and slightly different instrumentation and interior trim. Sales projections for 1984 called for 5,000 Ponys, but actual sales were closer to 25,000, making the Pony one of Canada's best-selling cars that year. A lesser-known model, also sold in Canada, was the Hyundai Stellar. Both models were available until 1987, when they were replaced by the Excel.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1989, **Hyundai Auto Canada Inc.** opened a stamping and assembly plant in Bromont, Quebec, employing 800. The plant cost $387.7 million, with Quebec and Canadian federal government subsidies of $131 million.[62] The plant was designed to manufacture approximately 2000 Hyundai Sonatas per week.[62] Subsequently, Chrysler and Hyundai considered a joint venture that would have Chrysler rebranding the Sonata manufactured at Bromont – only to later announce the deal had failed.[63] The Bromont plant was operational for four years before it closed – with Hyundai's sales unable to support the plant. With boost in sales in 2009, Hyundai Auto Canada Inc. is currently planning to build a new plant in Canada and resume production in Canada.[64] Hyundai subsequently sold the plant,[64] which was eventually purchased by Olymbec inc, a Quebec real estate developer. Hyundai is the No. 1 import car brand in Canada without a local plant. Sales over 100,000 cars-per-year mark in 2012.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Mexico[edit]\n\n\nHyundai Motor México entered the Mexican market in 2014 with the imported vehicles such as Grand i10, the Elantra, and the ix35.[66] Soon afterwards, the Hyundai Sonata joined the lineup. Prior to the introduction of the Hyundai brand for non-commercial vehicles, Hyundai passenger vehicles, light-duty cargo vans, and passenger vans were distributed by Chrysler de México, branded as Dodge.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n#### Brazil[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor Brasil\n\n![](image)Hyundai HB20, the first model exclusively introduced for the Brazilian market. 'HB' in HB20 stands for Hyundai Brasil.[69]\nIn October 2012, Hyundai launched a new small bi-fuel car, the HB20, designed specifically for the Brazilian mass-market. The car was developed under the \"Projeto HB\" (Hyundai Brazil) project, and is built at a new Hyundai factory in Brazil, located in Piracicaba, São Paulo.[70] The plant is the first wholly owned Hyundai plant in Latin America. With an investment of around R$1.2 billion, the plant has the capacity to produce 180,000 cars per year under three shifts.\n\n\nHyundai vehicles have also been produced in Brazil by local partner, Caoa Group at a plant located in Anápolis, Goiás. Production here started with the HR model in 2007, and continued with the Tucson in 2010, the HD78 truck in 2011, and the ix35 in 2013.[71]\n\n\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Unit sales and year-on-year rate in China. From March 2017, unit sales plummeted in retaliation for the installation of THAAD.\nHyundai cars, including those made by Hyundai's affiliate, Kia Motors, sold well in China until 2016, when sales fell by half, marking the start of a slump that continued into 2019, when the company announced plans to cut jobs in the region.[72]\n\n\nHyundai is currently working with its Chinese partner Beijing Automobile Industry Holding Co. to develop an electric car for sale only in China.[73][74] In September 2011, it was announced that Korean actor Lee Min-ho, who has enjoyed popularity in China, would promote Hyundai's new 'Veloster' in China.[75]\n\n\nHyundai and its sister company, Kia, were reported to have lost market share from 2017 because of their over-reliance on sedans, poor brand images and local Chinese automakers compete with price-competitive SUVs.[76]\n\n\n\n##### Beijing Hyundai[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Beijing Hyundai\n\nHyundai formed a 50-50 joint venture with Beijing Automotive Group since 2002 to produce cars in China.[77] The joint venture is called Beijing Hyundai, which also manufactures several models which are exclusive to the Chinese market.[78] It began operations in China by producing Sonata in December 2002.[79]\nThe joint venture sold 700,000 passenger cars in 2010, 855,995 car sales in 2012, and 2014 saw the company sell 1,120,000 vehicles.[80][81][82] Currently, the company operates five plants, three which is located in Beijing, one in Hubei, and another in Chongqing.[83]\n\n\n\n##### Hawtai partnership[edit]\n\n\nBetween 2002 and 2010,[84][85] Hawtai Motor had produced Chinese-market versions of the Hyundai Matrix,[86] the Hyundai Santa Fe[84][87] and the Hyundai Terracan.[84][87] The Santa Fe was the fifth most-purchased SUV in China in 2010,[88] and some of Hawtai's versions may greatly differ from those sold in other markets.[89] Hyundai ended its partnership with Hawtai in 2010.[90]\n\n\n\n##### Commercial vehicles[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2010, Hyundai signed an agreement with Sichuan Nanjun Automobile on setting up a commercial vehicle joint venture—Sichuan Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd.[74]\n\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor India\n\n![](image)Hyundai's manufacturing plant at Irungattukottai near Chennai, India\nHyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) was formed on 6 May 1996. During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, fellow South Korean Daewoo had entered the Indian automobile market just three years before, while Ford, Opel and Honda had entered less than a year back. Hyundai's first car in the country, the Hyundai Santro was launched on 23 September 1998 and was considered a success. It became the second best-selling car in the country from 2000.[91]\n\n\nHyundai Motor India Limited is currently the second largest auto exporter from India.[92][93] It is making India the global manufacturing base for small cars.[94]\n\n\nHyundai has two manufacturing plants in India located at Sriperumbudur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Both plants have a combined annual capacity of 600,000 units. In the year 2007, Hyundai opened its R&D facility in Hyderabad, employing now nearly 450 engineers from different parts of the country. Hyundai Motor India Engineering (HMIE) gives technical & engineering support in vehicle development to Hyundai's main R&D centre in Namyang, Korea.\n\n\n\n![](image)A stamp released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Hyundai in India\nIn 2007, Hyundai started its support engineering centre with CAD/CAE teams in Hyderabad, India. Hyundai expanded its engineering activities in India with Vehicle Engineering team in 2010. In 2011, Hyundai started its design activities at Hyderabad R&D Centre with Styling, Digital Design & Skin CAD Teams and Packaging team. Indian engineers are heavily involved in the making of Indian-oriented Hyundai vehicles including the i10, i20, along with other global cars.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn June 2017, The Competition Commission of India imposed ₹87 crore ($13.6 million) penalty for unfair business practices with respect to providing discounts for cars.[95]\n\n\n\n#### Japan[edit]\n\n\nHyundai Motors restarted passenger vehicle sales in Japan in 2022, after leaving the market in 2009. Since the relaunch, only electric cars are available, and the sales are online-only.\n\n\nDespite having growing sales worldwide, Hyundai struggled in Japan, having sold only 15,095 passenger cars from 2001 to 2009.[96][97] Following an announcement in November 2009, Hyundai pulled their passenger car division out of the Japanese market and focused on their commercial vehicle division instead.[96][97] The company said that it is possible for them to come back to Japan fully if market conditions continue to improve.[98]\n\n\nAccording to the newspaper *The Chosun Ilbo*, the reason for Hyundai's failure in the car market was due to the company's inability to recognize the value of small cars due to parking spaces. For instance, actor Bae Yong-joon was hired to endorse the mid-sized Sonata in Japan to appeal to housewives who watched the drama *Winter Sonata*. The marketing campaign backfired, as large sedans are driven primarily by middle-aged men, while housewives prefer compact cars.[*citation needed*] In addition, the Sonata was priced too similarly to its Japanese rivals, which resulted in poor sales.[99]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2022, Hyundai announced a comeback to Japan by marketing eco-friendly vehicles like the Ioniq 5 and Nexo with pre-orders from May 2022 for delivery beginning in July 2022 under the company name *Hyundai Mobility Japan*.[100] As of 2022, Hyundai Mobility Japan operates an office and R&D center in Yokohoma.[101]\n\n\n\n#### Philippines[edit]\n\n\nHyundai first entered the Philippine market with the Hyundai Excel compact car and the Hyundai Grace van in the early 1990s, later introducing the Hyundai Starex and the second generation Hyundai Elantra towards the end of the decade. Their assembly plant in Santa Rosa, Laguna produced the Hyundai Accent, Hyundai H100, and the Hyundai H350.[102] As of June 2022[update], there are 39 dealerships around the country but it will be expected to increase to 44 by the end of the year.[103] HARI currently focuses on Jeepneys, Trucks and Buses, while HMPH focuses on Cars, SUVs and Passenger Vans.\n\n\n**Hyundai Asia Resources, Inc. (HARI)** was the distributor of Hyundai passenger cars and currently the official distributor of Hyundai commercial vehicles in the country.[104] They were appointed by Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea in August 2001 as the official distributor of Hyundai vehicles in the Philippines. It had earned its spot as the third top player in the Philippine automotive industry. But due to the outrage of COVID-19 pandemic, they decided to abandon the passenger car market which resulted to their sales decline and the numerous of controversies surrounds them even before the pandemic. HARI has expected sales to be further boosted by its Hyundai Modern Jeepneys with the implementation of the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program.

Almost all of the finished vehicles were exported across Botswana's border to South Africa, where the vast majority of dealerships are situated.\n\n\n\n#### Egypt[edit]\n\n\nHyundai cars are also manufactured in Egypt, the local manufacturer is the Ghabbour Group, which is located in Cairo. They have a big model range and offers sports models of some car models which are only offered on the Egypt market. Formerly, the company had assembled vehicles such as the Verna.\n\n\n\n## Product line[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Hyundai vehicles\nHyundai produces sedans, hatchbacks, crossover SUVs, vans, pickups, heavy trucks and buses in numerous plants worldwide.\n\n\n### Cars[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBest-selling Hyundai models in 2022[48]\n| Rank\n | Model\n | Global sales\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Tucson | 560,862\n |\n| 2\n | Elantra / Avante / i30 Sedan | 370,973\n |\n| 3\n | Creta/ix25 | 303,077\n |\n| 4\n | i10/Xcent/Aura | 284,791\n |\n| 5\n | Kona/Kauai | 234,614\n |\n| 6\n | Santa Fe | 214,744\n |\n| 7\n | Venue | 188,701\n |\n| 8\n | i20 | 170,440\n |\n| 9\n | Palisade | 151,427\n |\n| 10\n | Sonata | 136,088\n |\n\n\nIts top-selling sedan, according to the company's sales data in 2021 was the Elantra (Avante in South Korea), which recorded 380,907 units. This model was produced in several plants, including in South Korea, United States, China, among others. Another popular sedan model is the Accent/Verna, which is popular in emerging markets including China, India, Middle East, as well as developed markets like North America. This model ceased to be produced in South Korea in 2019, as its production base were moved to Mexico and India.[134]\n\n\nOther sedan models are the mid-size Sonata, executive Grandeur, and several China-oriented models which consist of Reina, Celesta, Lafesta, and Mistra.\n\n\nSome hatchback models developed by Hyundai have been divided into models developed to cater to the Indian market and the European market. Both the i10 and i20 are models built in India and Europe, with several changes between the Indian and European versions to ensure the model could fit according to each market. Other hatchback models include the entry-level Santro first introduced in 1998 for the Indian market, i30 C-segment car for developed markets, the HB20 for the Brazilian market, and the hatchback version of Accent for markets outside India and Europe.\n\n\n\n### Crossovers/SUVs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Tucson is currently the best-selling Hyundai vehicle.\nHyundai entered the crossover SUV market early with the Santa Fe in 2000, followed by the smaller Tucson in 2004. The Santa Fe was a huge hit with American and European markets, despite receiving criticism in the past for Hyundai's obscure looks. It quickly became Hyundai's best seller and was one of the reasons Hyundai survived despite having their sales declined.[135] As of 2020, Hyundai has sold more than 5,260,000 units of Santa Fe globally.[136]\n\n\nThe first-generation Tucson shared its Elantra-based platform with the Kia Sportage. In most countries apart from South Korea and the United States, the Tucson was retired for the Hyundai ix35 from 2009 to 2015. However, the Tucson name was restored for the third generation, where it was to be used across all markets. It was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015.[135] The Tucson is the fourth best-selling SUV in the world in 2020, with a total sales of 451,703 units, below the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, and Volkswagen Tiguan.[137][138]\n\n\nBy mid-2010s, Hyundai moved into developing smaller crossover SUV models, starting from the Creta (ix25 in China) from 2014, and the Kona in 2017. The Kona is also consisted of a hybrid electric and a pure battery electric variant. By 2019, both model became the third and fourth-best selling vehicle of the brand, while the Creta has been the best-selling SUV in Russia since 2016,[139][140][141] and India in 2020.[142] In 2021, Hyundai released its first crossover SUV model in the South Korean light car segment, the Casper. It is the first venture of the brand in the segment in 15 years, and also the smallest automobile the brand produces of any kind.[143]\n\n\nCurrently, Hyundai produces 12 crossover SUV models for different markets.\n\n\n\n### Hybrid and electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai E-GMP and Ioniq\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**.

The test vehicle was 1991 MY Scoupe FFV.[144] Since March 1992, in Seoul, Korea, through at least November 1993, field trials of several FFVs had been performed over more than 30,000 miles.[144]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hyundai Sonata Hybrid uses a lightweight lithium polymer battery.\nThe new hybrid-electric FGV-1 was unveiled at the Seoul Motor Show in 1995 which featured full-time electric drive technology.[145] The 1995 FGV-1 was the result of Hyundai's first experiments with hybrid propulsion systems in 1994. The FGV-2 was the second vehicle to be produced. The company is using the \"parallel\" type design, which utilizes either the internal combustion engine or the electric motor.[145] Others are the Elantra HEV and the Hyundai Accent HEV, which were unveiled in 1999 and 2000, respectively.[145]\n\n\nThe first pure electric car developed by Hyundai was the Sonata Electric Vehicle in 1991. The car started as a Sonata sedan-based model.[146] Hyundai planned to have six electric vehicles available for testing by the end of 1992.[147]\n\n\nHyundai began mass-producing hybrid electric vehicles in 2008. The company is using Hybrid Blue Drive, which includes lithium polymer batteries, as opposed to lithium-ion.[148][149][150] The new hybrid Sonata made its debut at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2008.[151] The 2011 Sonata Hybrid sales in the U.S. began in February 2011.\n\n\nIn 2009, Hyundai released the Avante LPI Hybrid in the South Korean domestic market in July.[152] Hyundai showcased also the Hyundai BlueOn, an electric prototype of i10, was first unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2009. At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Hyundai unveiled the i-flow, a concept car using a variant of the BLUE-WILL hybrid system.[153]\n\n\nAs of March 2014[update], cumulative global sales of hybrid models totaled 200,000 units, including both Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors hybrid models.[154]\n\n\nIn 2016, Hyundai revealed the Ioniq five-door liftback to rival the Toyota Prius. The nameplate *Ioniq* is a portmanteau of *ion* and *unique*.[155] It is the first automobile to be offered in hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric variants with no \"standard\" internal combustion engine only version.[156][157][158] The hybrid variant launched in its home market in February 2016, followed by the electric model in July 2016.[157][159] The plug-in hybrid version followed in February 2017.[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is the first Hyundai model developed on the E-GMP platform.\nIn August 2020, the company announced the launch of Ioniq as its own new electric brand and confirmed three new electric cars that will be sold under the sub-brand. Ioniq is Hyundai's second stand-alone brand after the Genesis. The new brand is going to utilise Hyundai's Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), which they claims will enable \"fast charging capability and plentiful driving range.\"[161] The automaker said the first of the three new global models will be the Ioniq 5, a midsize crossover, arriving in early 2021. It will be followed by the Ioniq 6 sedan in late 2022, and then by the Ioniq 7, a large SUV, in early 2024. New models will be named numerically, with even numbers for sedans, and odd numbers for SUVs.[162]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Hyundai Motor Group announced details about its E-GMP platform that will be the underpinning of new Hyundai and Kia electric vehicles starting in 2021. Apart from Hyundai, Ioniq, and Kia brands, it will also be used for future Genesis electric cars.[163] The platform's main components is a battery pack under the cabin and an all-in-one motor, transmission, and inverter designed and developed by Hyundai. By bundling the components, Hyundai said, it raised the maximum speed of the motor by up to 70 percent compared to existing motors, despite its small size. The company claimed that it is capable to handle power output up to 600 hp (608 PS; 447 kW) from the system.[164]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Hyundai launched its first vehicle built above the E-GMP platform, the Ioniq 5. It is the first product to be marketed under the Ioniq sub-brand.[165] At its introduction, it is the most advanced electric vehicle produced by Hyundai. Its battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in 18 minutes with its 800 V charging capabilities by using a 350-kW charger. A five minutes charge will add 100 km (62 mi) to its range by WLTP standards.[166] Its claimed maximum range is 480 km (298 mi) for the rear-wheel-drive 72.6 kWh variant.[167]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Hyundai announced its new automotive factory in South Korea, solely dedicated for electric vehicles and with production set to begin in 2025. It will be the first Hyundai plant to open in South Korea since 1996.[168]\n\n\nHyundai is currently expanding its full-electric lineup by adding the Ioniq 6 to its lineup, which debuted in Europe in the second half of 2022, and in the United States in spring of 2023. Hyundai is also expanding its full-electric lineup with the Ioniq 7, which is projected to hit the market in 2024.[168]\n\n\n\n### Hydrogen vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Nexo\nIn March 2018, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered crossover SUV the Nexo.[169] In October 2020, South Korean domestic sales of the Nexo exceeded 10,000 vehicles.[170] As of July 2020, Hyundai had exported only 769 vehicles to the United States and Europe with supply limited due to domestic demand.[171][172]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered version of its Xcient truck the Xcient Fuel Cell delivering seven vehicles to customers in Switzerland.[173] The Xcient Fuel Cell is the world's first production hydrogen fuel cell truck.[173][174] In 2019, Hyundai formed Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility (HHM) together with Swiss company H2 Energy to lease trucks to Swiss customers with plans to deliver 50 trucks by 2020.[173] Hyundai chose to launch in Switzerland as its road tax does not apply to zero-emission trucks and for its ability to produce hydrogen using hydropower.[173] HHM formed a partnership with Hydrospider, a joint venture of H2Energy, Alpiq and Linde to produce hydrogen and to build hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in Switzerland.[175] The 34-ton Xcient Fuel Cell has a 190 kW fuel cell supported by a 73 kW battery pack that stores energy from the fuel cell and from braking, seven hydrogen tanks, a maximum speed of 85 km/h (53 mph), a driving range of about 400 kilometres (250 mi) and a refueling time of between 8 and 20 minutes.[174]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered version of its Elec City bus the Elec City FCEV that has a capacity of 44 passengers with 24 seats and 20 standing seats.[170][176] The bus has a 180 kW fuel cell supported by a 156 kW battery pack, five hydrogen tanks, a driving range of 434 kilometres (270 mi) and a refuelling time of 15 minutes.[176][177] In 2020, Hyundai exported two buses to Saudi Arabian oil company Saudi Aramco for demonstration.[178]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Hyundai suspended development of its Genesis, and possibly its other, hydrogen cars.[179]\n\n\n\n### Light commercial vehicles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

The company started selling trucks in 1969 with the D-750/800, followed by the R-182 as their first bus in 1970.[181]\n\n\nA joint venture called the Daimler-Hyundai Truck Corporation was established between Hyundai and Daimler AG[182] in 2000 to produce high-tech middle-range trucks and buses in the Korean market beginning in 2004.[183] However, after numerous delays and disputes,[184] the planned venture was cancelled in 2004, with DaimlerChrysler selling its 10.65 percent stake in Hyundai Motor.[185]\n\n\n\n## Military equipment[edit]\n\n\n*Hyundai Rotem* is a subsidiary, for manufacturing rolling stock, military equipment, and plant engineering.[186]\n\n\n\n\n## Environmental record[edit]\n\n\nOn 23 April 2008, Hyundai Motor announced the beginning of a five-year project to turn 50 km2 of infertile land into grassland by 2012. Hyundai is doing so with the help of the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement (KFEM). The project, named Hyundai Green Zone, is located 660 km north of Beijing. The goal of the project is to end the recurring dust storms in Beijing, block desertification and protect the local ecosystem. Local weeds will be planted in the region that have the ability to endure sterile alkaline soil. This is the first environmental project of the company's social contribution programme.\n\n\n\n## Motorsport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alister McRae driving an Accent WRC at the 2001 Rally Finland\nHyundai entered motorsport by competing in the F2 class of the World Rally Championship in 1998 and 1999. In September 1999, Hyundai unveiled the Accent WRC, a World Rally Car based on the Hyundai Accent. The Hyundai World Rally Team debuted the car at the 2000 Swedish Rally and achieved their first top-ten result at that year's Rally Argentina, when Alister McRae and Kenneth Eriksson finished seventh and eighth, respectively. Eriksson later drove the car to fifth place in New Zealand and fourth in Australia. In 2001, Hyundai debuted a new evolution of the Accent WRC, which was intended to improve reliability, but the performance of the car was still not good enough to challenge the four big teams (Ford, Mitsubishi, Peugeot and Subaru). However, at the season-ending Rally GB, the team achieved their best result with McRae finishing fourth and Eriksson sixth.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFor the 2002 season, Hyundai hired the four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, along with Freddy Loix and Armin Schwarz. Kankkunen's fifth place in New Zealand was the team's best result, but they managed to edge out Škoda and Mitsubishi by one point in the battle for fourth place in the manufacturers' world championship. In September 2003, after a season hampered by budget constraints, Hyundai announced withdrawal from the WRC and planned to return in 2006, which did not happen.[187]\n\n\nIn 2006, following the announcement that Korea was scheduled to earn a Formula One Grand Prix, Hyundai planned to enter the sport.[188] The Korean Grand Prix was first held in 2010, but Hyundai have not entered the championship. Hyundai announced they would be revealing their future rally plans at the 2011 Chicago Auto Show, on 9 February.[189] The current plans for rallying are focused around the newest Hyundai release, the Veloster.[190] In September 2012 Hyundai announced that they were due to start the WRC with a rally model of its i20 to rival the likes of the Ford Fiesta, the Citroen DS3 and the Mini Countryman.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n **Hyundai i20 WRC** \n\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai i20 WRC\nThe Hyundai i20 WRC is a World Rally Car built by Hyundai for use in the 2014 World Rally Championship.[191] It is based on the Hyundai i20 subcompact car, and was unveiled at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. The launch of the i20 marks Hyundai's return to the World Rally Championship after a ten-year absence.[192] The car is scheduled to make its first competitive appearance at the 2014 Rallye Monte Carlo, but may compete during the 2013 season to aid development.[193]\n\n\nThe car will be operated by Hyundai's performance division, Hyundai Motorsport from a base in Frankfurt, Germany.[194]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Corporate social responsibility[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Hyundai Motors established a committee to oversee its Corporate Social Responsibility programme.[195] Among the programme's initiatives have been the \"Happy Move Global Youth Volunteers Program\".[196]\n\n\nThe Hyundai Motors' India Foundation (HMIF) has invested more than 20 million rupees in various corporate social responsibility programmes in India. In 2011, it started the \"Go Green\" village adoption project in Tamil Nadu. Its aim was to promote environmentally friendly products, increase the forest cover in Tamil Nadu, and improve living and hygiene conditions in the region's villages. A number of schools have been adopted for improvement with the HMIF donating around 450 benches to government schools and drilling 10 bore wells.[197]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hyundai Motors signed a contract with UN Development Programme and launched a campaign ‘for Tomorrow’ in 2021 to create and realize a solution for problems that global society faces. In 2022, the documentary film 'for Tomorrow' was released which contains the main story of the 'for Tomorrow' project.[198]\n\n\n\n### Sports sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UEFA Euro 2012\n* BCCI\n* Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors FC\n* FIFA (Since 1999, except the FIFA Club World Cup)\n* International Cricket Council\n* UEFA (From 2000–2017)\n* Cricket World Cup (Until 2015)\n* Korea Football Association\n* A-League\n* Inside the NBA\n* National Football League[199]\n* Sun Bowl[200]\n* Hyundai Tournament of Champions\n* Olympique Lyonnais (from 2013 to 2020)\n* PFC CSKA Moscow\n* Millonarios Fútbol Club\n* Club Universitario de Deportes\n* Tampines Rovers FC\n* Al-Fateh SC\n* Moroka Swallows F.C.[201]\n* Mandurah City FC[202]\n* Park United FC[203]\n* Carlton Football Club[204]\n* Brisbane Lions\n* Brisbane Broncos\n* AS Cannes Volley-Ball\n* Hyundai Hockey Helpers[205]\n* Rhys Millen[206][207]\n* Atlético Madrid[208]\n* Hertha BSC\n* Chelsea FC\n* AS Roma\n\n### Other sponsorships[edit]\n\n\n* Academy Awards\n* CNN Worldwide\n* Hyundai Auto Club Philippines\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai Child Labor Scandal, Diesel emissions scandal, and Kia Challenge\n\n### Inflated fuel economy numbers[edit]\n\n\nAfter an investigation in 2012, the EPA found that 35% of all 2011–2013 Hyundai and Kia vehicles had inflated fuel economy numbers; by as much as six miles per gallon. Currently, Hyundai and Kia have started a reimbursement programme for the owners of the 2011–2013 affected vehicles.\n[209][210][211] In 2014 the company was issued $350 million in penalties by the US government, agreed to pay $395 million in 2013 to resolve claims from vehicles owners, and agreed to pay $41.2 million to cover the \"investigative costs\" of 33 US state attorneys general.[212]\n\n\n\n### Wrongly advertised engine and horsepower[edit]\n\n\nSeveral consumers complained that the engine delivered with the Hyundai Veloster in Brazil was inferior to the one advertised.[213] Independent tests confirmed that it was not the same engine, and it delivered only 121 CV (119 HP) instead of the advertised 140 CV (138 HP), with the car earning derogatory nicknames like Slowster in the Brazilian market.[214]\n\n\n\n### Marketing controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2013, Hyundai Motors UK released a commercial depicting a man attempting to commit suicide via carbon monoxide poisoning in an ix35, only to fail to do so because of the vehicle's non-toxic emissions. The advert, produced by Hyundai's in-house agency Innocean Worldwide, received widespread criticism for promoting suicide.[215] Hyundai has since taken down the video and issued a formal apology.[215][216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Bering Truck Corporation\n* Hyundai Group\n* Hyundai Mobis\n* Hyundai Motor Group\n* Kia Motors\n* List of Hyundai engines\n* List of Korean car makers\n* List of Hyundai Motor Company transmissions\n* List of Hyundai distributors world wide\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Pronunciations in English vary, and include:\n\n\n\t* /ˈh(j)ʌndeɪ/ *H(Y)UN-day*\n\t* /ˈh(j)ʌndaɪ/ *H(Y)UN-dye*\n\t* /haɪˈuːndaɪ/ *hy-OON-dye*\n\t* /hiˈʌndeɪ/ *hee-UN-day*\n\nThe closest English pronunciation to the original Korean would be /ˈhjʌndɛ/ *HYUN-deh*, but the final vowel is checked and cannot occur word-final in English.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hyundai Motor 2016 Fast Facts\".

Currently, the company owns 33.88 percent of Kia Corporation,[5] and also fully owns two marques including its luxury cars subsidiary, Genesis, and an electric vehicle sub-brand, Ioniq.[6][7][8] Those three brands altogether comprise the Hyundai Motor Group.\n\n\nHyundai operates the world's largest integrated automobile manufacturing facility in Ulsan, South Korea which has an annual production capacity of 1.6 million units.[9] The company employs about 75,000 people worldwide. Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through 5,000 dealerships and showrooms.[10] As of 2022, Hyundai is the world's third-largest carmaker in terms of production, behind Toyota and Volkswagen.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1982 Hyundai Pony\nChung Ju-yung (1915–2001) founded the Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company in 1947. Hyundai Motor Company was later established in 1967, and the company's first model, the Cortina, was released in cooperation with Ford Motor Company in 1968.[12] When Hyundai wanted to develop their own car, they hired George Turnbull in February 1974, the former managing director of Austin Morris at British Leyland. He in turn hired five other top British car engineers. They were body designer Kenneth Barnett, engineers John Simpson and Edward Chapman, John Crosthwaite, formerly of BRM, as chassis engineer and Peter Slater as chief development engineer.[13][14][15][16] In 1975, the Pony, the first South Korean car, was released, with styling by Giorgio Giugiaro of Italdesign and powertrain technology provided by Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. Exports began in the following year to Ecuador and soon thereafter to the Benelux countries. Hyundai entered the British market in 1982, selling 2993 cars in their first year there.[17]\n\n\nIn 1984, Hyundai began exporting the Pony to Canada, but not to the United States, as the Pony would not pass emissions standards there. Canadian sales greatly exceeded expectations, and it was at one point the top-selling car on the Canadian market. In 1985, the one millionth Hyundai car was built.[18] Until the 1986 introduction of the larger Hyundai Grandeur, Hyundai offered a locally assembled Ford Granada for the South Korean executive market. The import of these knocked down kits was permitted as long as Hyundai exported five cars for every single Granada brought in (the same demands were placed on Kia).[19]\n\n\nIn 1986, Hyundai began to sell cars in the United States, and the Excel was nominated as \"Best Product #10\" by *Fortune* magazine, largely because of its affordability. The company began to produce models with its own technology in 1988, beginning with the midsize Sonata. In the spring of 1990, aggregate production of Hyundai automobiles reached the four million mark.[18] In 1991, the company succeeded in developing its first proprietary gasoline engine, the four-cylinder Alpha, and also its own transmission, thus paving the way for technological independence.\n\n\nIn 1996, Hyundai Motor India Limited was established with a production plant in Irungattukottai near Chennai, India.[20]\n\n\nIn 1998, Hyundai began to overhaul its image in an attempt to establish itself as a world-class brand. Chung Ju-yung transferred leadership of Hyundai Motor to his son, Chung Mong-koo, in 1999.[21] Hyundai's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, invested heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. It added a 10-year or 100,000-mile (160,000 km) warranty to cars sold in the United States and launched an aggressive marketing campaign.\n\n\nIn 2004, Hyundai was ranked second in \"initial quality\" in a survey/study by J.D. Power and Associates in North America.[22][23] Hyundai is now one of the top 100 most valuable brands worldwide according to Interbrand.[24] Since 2002, Hyundai has also been one of the worldwide official sponsors of the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nIn 2006, the South Korean government initiated an investigation of Chung Mong-koo's practices as head of Hyundai, suspecting him of corruption. On 28 April 2006, Chung was arrested, and charged for embezzlement of 100 billion South Korean won (US$106 million).[25] As a result, Hyundai vice chairman and CEO, Kim Dong-jin, replaced him as head of the company.\n\n\nOn 30 September 2011, Yang Seung-suk announced his retirement as CEO of Hyundai Motor Co. In the interim replacement period, Chung Mong-koo and Kim Eok-jo divided the duties of the CEO position.[26]\n\n\nIn 2014, Hyundai started an initiative to focus on improving vehicle dynamics in its vehicles and hired Albert Biermann, former Vice President of Engineering at BMW M, to direct chassis development for Hyundai vehicles, stating: \"The company intends to become a technical leader in ride and handling, producing vehicles that lead their respective segments for driver engagement.\"[27]\n\n\nOn 14 October 2020, Euisun Chung was inaugurated as the new chairman of the Hyundai Motor Group. His father, Chung Mong-koo, has been made Honorary Chairman.[28]\n\n\nIn April 2021, the company said that its profits rose by 187%, the highest rise in four years. The company recorded a profit of $1.16 billion from the beginning of 2021 until March.[29]\n\n\n\n### Research and development[edit]\n\n\nHyundai has six research and development centers, located in South Korea (three offices), Germany, Japan and India. Additionally, a center in California develops designs for the United States.[30]\n\n\nHyundai established the Hyundai Design Center in Fountain Valley, California in 1990. The center moved to a new $30 million facility in Irvine, California in 2003, and was renamed the Hyundai Kia Motors Design and Technical Center. The facility also housed Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc, a subsidiary responsible for all engineering activities in the U.S. for Hyundai. Hyundai America Technical Center moved to its new 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2), $117 million headquarters in Superior Township, Michigan (near Ann Arbor) in 2005.[31]\n\n\nIn 2004, Hyundai America Technical Center completed construction of its Hyundai/Kia proving ground in California City, California. The 4,300-acre (17 km2) facility is located in the Mojave Desert and features a 6.4-mile (10.3 km) oval track,[9] a Vehicle Dynamics Area, a vehicle-handling course inside the oval track, a paved hill road, and several special surface roads. A 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) complex featuring offices and indoor testing areas is located on the premises as well. The facility was built at a cost of $50 million.\n\n\nIn the 2021 review of WIPO's annual World Intellectual Property Indicators Hyundai ranked as 4th in the world for its 141 industrial design registrations being published under the Hague System during 2020.[32] This position is up on their previous 7th-place ranking for 57 industrial design registrations being published in 2019.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Business[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai Motor Group\n\n![](image)The world's largest automobile manufacturing plant in Ulsan, South Korea, produces over 1.6 million vehicles annually.In 1998, after a shake-up in the South Korean auto industry caused by overambitious expansion and the Asian financial crisis, Hyundai acquired the majority of rival Kia Motors.[35]\n\n\nIn 2000, the company established a strategic alliance with DaimlerChrysler and severed its partnership with the Hyundai Group. In 2001, the Daimler-Hyundai Truck Corporation was formed. In 2004, however, DaimlerChrysler divested its interest in the company by selling its 10.5% stake for $900 million.\n\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Motor America headquarters in Fountain Valley, California\nHyundai has invested in manufacturing plants in North America, India, the Czech Republic, Russia, China and Turkey as well as research and development centers in Europe, Asia, North America and the Pacific Rim. In 2004, Hyundai Motor Company had $57.2 billion in sales in South Korea making it the country's second largest corporation, or chaebol, after Samsung. Worldwide sales in 2005 reached 2,533,695 units, an 11 percent increase over the previous year. In 2011, Hyundai sold 4.05 million cars worldwide and the Hyundai Motor Group was the world's fourth largest automaker behind GM, Volkswagen and Toyota.[36][37] Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through some 5,000 dealerships.\n\n\nIn February 2021, CNBC reported that Apple and Hyundai-Kia are close to finalizing a deal to build an autonomous Apple car. The vehicle was said to be completely designed by Apple and would be built in Hyundai or Kia plants, and could potentially go into production in 2024.[38] However, Hyundai Motor announced shortly after that it is no longer in talks with Apple.[39][40]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Hyundai Motor Group completed its acquisition of a controlling interest in the robotics firm, Boston Dynamics. Hyundai Motor Group now takes an 80% share of the company.[41]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong Koo (right) sitting next to South Korean president Park Geun-hye in 2013\n* Chung Eui-sun, Executive Chairman of Hyundai Motors\n* Chang Jae-hoon, President and CEO of Hyundai Motors\n* Lee Dong-seock, Vice President\n* Jose Munoz, Global COO\n* Gang Hyun-seo, Executive Vice President\n* Yoon Chi-won, Former Chairman of EQONEX\n* Eugene M.

Bürkle had previously worked for BMW, having designed the BMW 3 Series (E46), and the BMW 6 Series (E63).[42][43] Hyundai's current design philosophy is known as *Fluidic Sculpture*,[44] which is heavily inspired by nature.[45]\n\n\nIn 2018, the company announced the *Sensuous Sportiness* next-generation design direction. The design philosophy was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show demonstrated by the Le Fil Rouge concept car, and has been rolled out into their recent models, ranging from sedans to SUVs.[46] The *Sensuous Sportiness* design identity and strategy has won Design Management Institute's (DMI) Design Value Award 2020.[47]\n\n\n\n## Regional operations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Hyundai Motor Company manufacturing facilities\n\n\n\n| Top 8 Hyundai and Genesis vehicleproduction by country, 2021[48] |\n| --- |\n| Rank\n | Country\n | Vehicleproduction\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) South Korea | 1,646,888\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image) India | 635,413\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) China | 360,565\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) United States | 288,967\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) Czech Republic | 275,620\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image) Russia | 235,157\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image) Brazil | 188,349\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image) Turkey | 161,500\n |\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor America\n\n![](image)Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nHyundai Motor America began selling cars in the United States on 20 February 1986, with a single model, the Hyundai Excel. That year, Hyundai set a record of selling the most automobiles in its first year of business in the United States compared to any other car brand; total sales in 1986 were 168,882.[49]\n\n\nInitially well received, the Excel's faults soon became apparent; cost-cutting measures caused reliability to suffer. With an increasingly poor reputation for quality, Hyundai sales plummeted, and many dealerships either earned their profits on repairs or abandoned the product. At one point, Hyundai became the butt of many jokes (i.e. Hyundai stands for \"Hope you understand nothing's driveable and inexpensive\").[50]\n\n\nIn response, Hyundai began investing heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. The company added free maintenance for the first 2 years or 24,000 miles for all its new cars sold, starting with the 1992 model year. It also added a 10-year or 100,000-mile (160,000 km) powertrain warranty (known as the Hyundai Advantage) to its vehicles sold in the United States, it is now known as the America Best Warranty.[51]\n\n\nHyundai incorporated a new manufacturing facility, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, in April 2002. The new plant in Montgomery, Alabama, was completed during 2004, at a cost of $1.7 billion. Production started in May 2005. It employed more than 3,000 workers in 2012.[52]\n\n\nBy 2004, sales had dramatically increased, and the reputation of Hyundai cars improved. In 2004, Hyundai tied with Honda for initial brand quality in a survey/study from J.D. Power and Associates, for having 102 problems per 1000 vehicles. This made Hyundai second in the industry, only behind Toyota, for initial vehicle quality. The company continued this tradition by placing third overall in J.D. Power's 2006 Initial Quality Survey, behind only Porsche and Lexus.[53]\n\n\nIn 2009, the Hyundai Genesis luxury sedan was named 2009 North American Car of the Year, the first for Hyundai.[54] The model has received a number of well-recognized automobile awards worldwide. It also won the 2009 Canadian Car of the Year after winning its category of Best New Luxury Car under $50,000.[55] The Hyundai's V8 Tau engine in the Genesis received 2009 Ward's 10 Best Engines award.[56]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the Hyundai Elantra was named the North American Car of the Year at the North American International Auto Show, selling more than 200,000 cars since the model's redesigned debut.[57]\n\n\nAn urban air mobility (UAM) subsidiary called *Supernal* was established in 2020.[58][59] The name means 'Best Quality' and 'Heavenly'.[60] On November 8, 2023, Hyundai announced that a new plant will be built in the United States to produce flying taxis for commuters. They are targeting a test flight as early as December 2024. [61]\n\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Auto Canada office in Markham\nThe second-generation Hyundai Pony was available for sale in Canada starting with the 1984 model year. The Canadian Pony differed from its European counterparts by having 8 km/h bumpers, sealed-beam headlights, side marker lamps, and slightly different instrumentation and interior trim. Sales projections for 1984 called for 5,000 Ponys, but actual sales were closer to 25,000, making the Pony one of Canada's best-selling cars that year. A lesser-known model, also sold in Canada, was the Hyundai Stellar. Both models were available until 1987, when they were replaced by the Excel.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1989, **Hyundai Auto Canada Inc.** opened a stamping and assembly plant in Bromont, Quebec, employing 800. The plant cost $387.7 million, with Quebec and Canadian federal government subsidies of $131 million.[62] The plant was designed to manufacture approximately 2000 Hyundai Sonatas per week.[62] Subsequently, Chrysler and Hyundai considered a joint venture that would have Chrysler rebranding the Sonata manufactured at Bromont – only to later announce the deal had failed.[63] The Bromont plant was operational for four years before it closed – with Hyundai's sales unable to support the plant. With boost in sales in 2009, Hyundai Auto Canada Inc. is currently planning to build a new plant in Canada and resume production in Canada.[64] Hyundai subsequently sold the plant,[64] which was eventually purchased by Olymbec inc, a Quebec real estate developer. Hyundai is the No. 1 import car brand in Canada without a local plant. Sales over 100,000 cars-per-year mark in 2012.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Mexico[edit]\n\n\nHyundai Motor México entered the Mexican market in 2014 with the imported vehicles such as Grand i10, the Elantra, and the ix35.[66] Soon afterwards, the Hyundai Sonata joined the lineup. Prior to the introduction of the Hyundai brand for non-commercial vehicles, Hyundai passenger vehicles, light-duty cargo vans, and passenger vans were distributed by Chrysler de México, branded as Dodge.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n#### Brazil[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor Brasil\n\n![](image)Hyundai HB20, the first model exclusively introduced for the Brazilian market. 'HB' in HB20 stands for Hyundai Brasil.[69]\nIn October 2012, Hyundai launched a new small bi-fuel car, the HB20, designed specifically for the Brazilian mass-market. The car was developed under the \"Projeto HB\" (Hyundai Brazil) project, and is built at a new Hyundai factory in Brazil, located in Piracicaba, São Paulo.[70] The plant is the first wholly owned Hyundai plant in Latin America. With an investment of around R$1.2 billion, the plant has the capacity to produce 180,000 cars per year under three shifts.\n\n\nHyundai vehicles have also been produced in Brazil by local partner, Caoa Group at a plant located in Anápolis, Goiás. Production here started with the HR model in 2007, and continued with the Tucson in 2010, the HD78 truck in 2011, and the ix35 in 2013.[71]\n\n\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Unit sales and year-on-year rate in China. From March 2017, unit sales plummeted in retaliation for the installation of THAAD.\nHyundai cars, including those made by Hyundai's affiliate, Kia Motors, sold well in China until 2016, when sales fell by half, marking the start of a slump that continued into 2019, when the company announced plans to cut jobs in the region.[72]\n\n\nHyundai is currently working with its Chinese partner Beijing Automobile Industry Holding Co. to develop an electric car for sale only in China.[73][74] In September 2011, it was announced that Korean actor Lee Min-ho, who has enjoyed popularity in China, would promote Hyundai's new 'Veloster' in China.[75]\n\n\nHyundai and its sister company, Kia, were reported to have lost market share from 2017 because of their over-reliance on sedans, poor brand images and local Chinese automakers compete with price-competitive SUVs.[76]\n\n\n\n##### Beijing Hyundai[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Beijing Hyundai\n\nHyundai formed a 50-50 joint venture with Beijing Automotive Group since 2002 to produce cars in China.[77] The joint venture is called Beijing Hyundai, which also manufactures several models which are exclusive to the Chinese market.[78] It began operations in China by producing Sonata in December 2002.[79]\nThe joint venture sold 700,000 passenger cars in 2010, 855,995 car sales in 2012, and 2014 saw the company sell 1,120,000 vehicles.[80][81][82] Currently, the company operates five plants, three which is located in Beijing, one in Hubei, and another in Chongqing.[83]\n\n\n\n##### Hawtai partnership[edit]\n\n\nBetween 2002 and 2010,[84][85] Hawtai Motor had produced Chinese-market versions of the Hyundai Matrix,[86] the Hyundai Santa Fe[84][87] and the Hyundai Terracan.[84][87] The Santa Fe was the fifth most-purchased SUV in China in 2010,[88] and some of Hawtai's versions may greatly differ from those sold in other markets.[89] Hyundai ended its partnership with Hawtai in 2010.[90]\n\n\n\n##### Commercial vehicles[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2010, Hyundai signed an agreement with Sichuan Nanjun Automobile on setting up a commercial vehicle joint venture—Sichuan Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd.[74]\n\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor India\n\n![](image)Hyundai's manufacturing plant at Irungattukottai near Chennai, India\nHyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) was formed on 6 May 1996. During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, fellow South Korean Daewoo had entered the Indian automobile market just three years before, while Ford, Opel and Honda had entered less than a year back. Hyundai's first car in the country, the Hyundai Santro was launched on 23 September 1998 and was considered a success. It became the second best-selling car in the country from 2000.[91]\n\n\nHyundai Motor India Limited is currently the second largest auto exporter from India.[92][93] It is making India the global manufacturing base for small cars.[94]\n\n\nHyundai has two manufacturing plants in India located at Sriperumbudur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Both plants have a combined annual capacity of 600,000 units. In the year 2007, Hyundai opened its R&D facility in Hyderabad, employing now nearly 450 engineers from different parts of the country. Hyundai Motor India Engineering (HMIE) gives technical & engineering support in vehicle development to Hyundai's main R&D centre in Namyang, Korea.\n\n\n\n![](image)A stamp released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Hyundai in India\nIn 2007, Hyundai started its support engineering centre with CAD/CAE teams in Hyderabad, India. Hyundai expanded its engineering activities in India with Vehicle Engineering team in 2010. In 2011, Hyundai started its design activities at Hyderabad R&D Centre with Styling, Digital Design & Skin CAD Teams and Packaging team. Indian engineers are heavily involved in the making of Indian-oriented Hyundai vehicles including the i10, i20, along with other global cars.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn June 2017, The Competition Commission of India imposed ₹87 crore ($13.6 million) penalty for unfair business practices with respect to providing discounts for cars.[95]\n\n\n\n#### Japan[edit]\n\n\nHyundai Motors restarted passenger vehicle sales in Japan in 2022, after leaving the market in 2009. Since the relaunch, only electric cars are available, and the sales are online-only.\n\n\nDespite having growing sales worldwide, Hyundai struggled in Japan, having sold only 15,095 passenger cars from 2001 to 2009.[96][97] Following an announcement in November 2009, Hyundai pulled their passenger car division out of the Japanese market and focused on their commercial vehicle division instead.[96][97] The company said that it is possible for them to come back to Japan fully if market conditions continue to improve.[98]\n\n\nAccording to the newspaper *The Chosun Ilbo*, the reason for Hyundai's failure in the car market was due to the company's inability to recognize the value of small cars due to parking spaces. For instance, actor Bae Yong-joon was hired to endorse the mid-sized Sonata in Japan to appeal to housewives who watched the drama *Winter Sonata*. The marketing campaign backfired, as large sedans are driven primarily by middle-aged men, while housewives prefer compact cars.[*citation needed*] In addition, the Sonata was priced too similarly to its Japanese rivals, which resulted in poor sales.[99]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2022, Hyundai announced a comeback to Japan by marketing eco-friendly vehicles like the Ioniq 5 and Nexo with pre-orders from May 2022 for delivery beginning in July 2022 under the company name *Hyundai Mobility Japan*.[100] As of 2022, Hyundai Mobility Japan operates an office and R&D center in Yokohoma.[101]\n\n\n\n#### Philippines[edit]\n\n\nHyundai first entered the Philippine market with the Hyundai Excel compact car and the Hyundai Grace van in the early 1990s, later introducing the Hyundai Starex and the second generation Hyundai Elantra towards the end of the decade. Their assembly plant in Santa Rosa, Laguna produced the Hyundai Accent, Hyundai H100, and the Hyundai H350.[102] As of June 2022[update], there are 39 dealerships around the country but it will be expected to increase to 44 by the end of the year.[103] HARI currently focuses on Jeepneys, Trucks and Buses, while HMPH focuses on Cars, SUVs and Passenger Vans.\n\n\n**Hyundai Asia Resources, Inc. (HARI)** was the distributor of Hyundai passenger cars and currently the official distributor of Hyundai commercial vehicles in the country.[104] They were appointed by Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea in August 2001 as the official distributor of Hyundai vehicles in the Philippines. It had earned its spot as the third top player in the Philippine automotive industry. But due to the outrage of COVID-19 pandemic, they decided to abandon the passenger car market which resulted to their sales decline and the numerous of controversies surrounds them even before the pandemic. HARI has expected sales to be further boosted by its Hyundai Modern Jeepneys with the implementation of the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program. HARI targets to sell more modern jeepneys as the government pushes for the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program to replace the country's aging jeepneys.\n\n\nIn early 2022, **Hyundai Motor Philippines, Inc. (HMPH)** became the official distributor of Hyundai passenger cars in the country after the company was able to take over its passenger car operations from HARI,[105] Audrey Byun is the CEO, while Lee Dong-wook is the President and Victor Jose Vela is the Deputy General Manager of the company.[106][107] They started their operations on 1 June 2022,[108] and also, they have unveiled 4 new models, which are the following: the Creta subcompact crossover, the Tucson compact crossover, the Santa Fe mid-size crossover and the Staria passenger van through a dealer conference on 20 June 2022.[109][110] Meanwhile, the sales of these cars in dealerships will begin in July 2022.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Indonesia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Indonesia\n\n![](image)HMMI, the largest manufacturing plant in South East Asia\nIn November 2019, Hyundai announced that it is building the first wholly owned Southeast Asian car plant located in Indonesia.[112] Known as Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Indonesia (HMMI), it is built in Cikarang, Bekasi and will fully operate in the second half of 2021 with the annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles.[113] Half of the output would be exported to the neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia.[114] A total of US$1.55 billion (Rp 21.7 trillion) would be invested to the plant along with the future product developments until 2030.[115] HMMI would produce a region-specific compact MPV among other models.\n\n\n\n#### Turkey[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Assan Otomotiv\n\nIn September 1997, Hyundai opened a manufacturing plant in Turkey, located in İzmit, Kocaeli Province. The facility, named Hyundai Assan Otomotiv, was built as a 50-50% joint venture between the Hyundai Motor Company and the Kibar Holding of Turkey, the first stage investment raising to US$180 million.[116] It currently has an annual production capacity of 125,000 units and it manufactured the Accent, the H-100, the Starex, the Matrix and since 2010, the i20.[117] In May 2013, Hyundai Turkey Izmit plant capacity was increased to up to 200,000 units with 470 million Euro investment. The i10 and i20 were started to be produced in the plant.[118]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai Motor Europe\n\n#### Germany[edit]\n\n\nHyundai has been operating an R&D centre in Frankfurt, Germany since 1994,[119] that has been responsible for monitoring technology developments in Europe and designing and engineering new cars for the European market.[120] In September 2003, the company opened its new European headquarters in Rüsselsheim, after an investment worth 50 million euro.[121] The site became the new location for the R&D centre and for the world rally team of the company.[122]\n\n\n\n#### Czech Republic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Czech\n\nIn November 2008, Hyundai opened its European plant in Nošovice, Czech Republic, following an investment of over 1 billion euros and over two years of construction.[123][124] The plant, which mainly manufactures the i30, ix20, ix35 for the European market, has an annual capacity of 300,000 cars.[125] The new Hyundai plant is 90 kilometres north of Kia Motors' Žilina Plant in Slovakia.[126]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Rus\n\nIn Russia, the production of the Hyundai Accent, Sonata, Elantra and Santa Fe models has been taking place at the TagAZ plant,[127] located in Taganrog, since 2001,[128] in the form of complete knock-down kits assembly.[129] Since 2006, the factory has also been assembling the Hyundai Porter,[127] County, Aero Town and the HD 500 commercial vehicles.[128]\n\n\nIn June 2008, Hyundai started the construction of a new manufacturing plant in Saint Petersburg with a planned yearly capacity of 100,000 cars,[130] that will eventually be increased to 200,000 units.[131] It started mass production in January 2011,[131] with two models: the Hyundai Solaris and the Kia Rio.[132]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Hyundai Wia division opened a car engine manufacturing plant in Saint Petersburg, the biggest in Russia and the fifth in the world. The new plant is designed to produce about 330.000 engines for Hyundai Solaris and Creta as well as for Kia Rio by the end of the year 2021.

Almost all of the finished vehicles were exported across Botswana's border to South Africa, where the vast majority of dealerships are situated.\n\n\n\n#### Egypt[edit]\n\n\nHyundai cars are also manufactured in Egypt, the local manufacturer is the Ghabbour Group, which is located in Cairo. They have a big model range and offers sports models of some car models which are only offered on the Egypt market. Formerly, the company had assembled vehicles such as the Verna.\n\n\n\n## Product line[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Hyundai vehicles\nHyundai produces sedans, hatchbacks, crossover SUVs, vans, pickups, heavy trucks and buses in numerous plants worldwide.\n\n\n### Cars[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBest-selling Hyundai models in 2022[48]\n| Rank\n | Model\n | Global sales\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Tucson | 560,862\n |\n| 2\n | Elantra / Avante / i30 Sedan | 370,973\n |\n| 3\n | Creta/ix25 | 303,077\n |\n| 4\n | i10/Xcent/Aura | 284,791\n |\n| 5\n | Kona/Kauai | 234,614\n |\n| 6\n | Santa Fe | 214,744\n |\n| 7\n | Venue | 188,701\n |\n| 8\n | i20 | 170,440\n |\n| 9\n | Palisade | 151,427\n |\n| 10\n | Sonata | 136,088\n |\n\n\nIts top-selling sedan, according to the company's sales data in 2021 was the Elantra (Avante in South Korea), which recorded 380,907 units. This model was produced in several plants, including in South Korea, United States, China, among others. Another popular sedan model is the Accent/Verna, which is popular in emerging markets including China, India, Middle East, as well as developed markets like North America. This model ceased to be produced in South Korea in 2019, as its production base were moved to Mexico and India.[134]\n\n\nOther sedan models are the mid-size Sonata, executive Grandeur, and several China-oriented models which consist of Reina, Celesta, Lafesta, and Mistra.\n\n\nSome hatchback models developed by Hyundai have been divided into models developed to cater to the Indian market and the European market. Both the i10 and i20 are models built in India and Europe, with several changes between the Indian and European versions to ensure the model could fit according to each market. Other hatchback models include the entry-level Santro first introduced in 1998 for the Indian market, i30 C-segment car for developed markets, the HB20 for the Brazilian market, and the hatchback version of Accent for markets outside India and Europe.\n\n\n\n### Crossovers/SUVs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Tucson is currently the best-selling Hyundai vehicle.\nHyundai entered the crossover SUV market early with the Santa Fe in 2000, followed by the smaller Tucson in 2004. The Santa Fe was a huge hit with American and European markets, despite receiving criticism in the past for Hyundai's obscure looks. It quickly became Hyundai's best seller and was one of the reasons Hyundai survived despite having their sales declined.[135] As of 2020, Hyundai has sold more than 5,260,000 units of Santa Fe globally.[136]\n\n\nThe first-generation Tucson shared its Elantra-based platform with the Kia Sportage. In most countries apart from South Korea and the United States, the Tucson was retired for the Hyundai ix35 from 2009 to 2015. However, the Tucson name was restored for the third generation, where it was to be used across all markets. It was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015.[135] The Tucson is the fourth best-selling SUV in the world in 2020, with a total sales of 451,703 units, below the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, and Volkswagen Tiguan.[137][138]\n\n\nBy mid-2010s, Hyundai moved into developing smaller crossover SUV models, starting from the Creta (ix25 in China) from 2014, and the Kona in 2017. The Kona is also consisted of a hybrid electric and a pure battery electric variant. By 2019, both model became the third and fourth-best selling vehicle of the brand, while the Creta has been the best-selling SUV in Russia since 2016,[139][140][141] and India in 2020.[142] In 2021, Hyundai released its first crossover SUV model in the South Korean light car segment, the Casper. It is the first venture of the brand in the segment in 15 years, and also the smallest automobile the brand produces of any kind.[143]\n\n\nCurrently, Hyundai produces 12 crossover SUV models for different markets.\n\n\n\n### Hybrid and electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai E-GMP and Ioniq\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**.

The test vehicle was 1991 MY Scoupe FFV.[144] Since March 1992, in Seoul, Korea, through at least November 1993, field trials of several FFVs had been performed over more than 30,000 miles.[144]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hyundai Sonata Hybrid uses a lightweight lithium polymer battery.\nThe new hybrid-electric FGV-1 was unveiled at the Seoul Motor Show in 1995 which featured full-time electric drive technology.[145] The 1995 FGV-1 was the result of Hyundai's first experiments with hybrid propulsion systems in 1994. The FGV-2 was the second vehicle to be produced. The company is using the \"parallel\" type design, which utilizes either the internal combustion engine or the electric motor.[145] Others are the Elantra HEV and the Hyundai Accent HEV, which were unveiled in 1999 and 2000, respectively.[145]\n\n\nThe first pure electric car developed by Hyundai was the Sonata Electric Vehicle in 1991. The car started as a Sonata sedan-based model.[146] Hyundai planned to have six electric vehicles available for testing by the end of 1992.[147]\n\n\nHyundai began mass-producing hybrid electric vehicles in 2008. The company is using Hybrid Blue Drive, which includes lithium polymer batteries, as opposed to lithium-ion.[148][149][150] The new hybrid Sonata made its debut at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2008.[151] The 2011 Sonata Hybrid sales in the U.S. began in February 2011.\n\n\nIn 2009, Hyundai released the Avante LPI Hybrid in the South Korean domestic market in July.[152] Hyundai showcased also the Hyundai BlueOn, an electric prototype of i10, was first unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2009.

The nameplate *Ioniq* is a portmanteau of *ion* and *unique*.[155] It is the first automobile to be offered in hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric variants with no \"standard\" internal combustion engine only version.[156][157][158] The hybrid variant launched in its home market in February 2016, followed by the electric model in July 2016.[157][159] The plug-in hybrid version followed in February 2017.[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is the first Hyundai model developed on the E-GMP platform.\nIn August 2020, the company announced the launch of Ioniq as its own new electric brand and confirmed three new electric cars that will be sold under the sub-brand. Ioniq is Hyundai's second stand-alone brand after the Genesis. The new brand is going to utilise Hyundai's Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), which they claims will enable \"fast charging capability and plentiful driving range.\"[161] The automaker said the first of the three new global models will be the Ioniq 5, a midsize crossover, arriving in early 2021. It will be followed by the Ioniq 6 sedan in late 2022, and then by the Ioniq 7, a large SUV, in early 2024. New models will be named numerically, with even numbers for sedans, and odd numbers for SUVs.[162]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Hyundai Motor Group announced details about its E-GMP platform that will be the underpinning of new Hyundai and Kia electric vehicles starting in 2021. Apart from Hyundai, Ioniq, and Kia brands, it will also be used for future Genesis electric cars.[163] The platform's main components is a battery pack under the cabin and an all-in-one motor, transmission, and inverter designed and developed by Hyundai. By bundling the components, Hyundai said, it raised the maximum speed of the motor by up to 70 percent compared to existing motors, despite its small size. The company claimed that it is capable to handle power output up to 600 hp (608 PS; 447 kW) from the system.[164]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Hyundai launched its first vehicle built above the E-GMP platform, the Ioniq 5. It is the first product to be marketed under the Ioniq sub-brand.[165] At its introduction, it is the most advanced electric vehicle produced by Hyundai. Its battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in 18 minutes with its 800 V charging capabilities by using a 350-kW charger. A five minutes charge will add 100 km (62 mi) to its range by WLTP standards.[166] Its claimed maximum range is 480 km (298 mi) for the rear-wheel-drive 72.6 kWh variant.[167]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Hyundai announced its new automotive factory in South Korea, solely dedicated for electric vehicles and with production set to begin in 2025. It will be the first Hyundai plant to open in South Korea since 1996.[168]\n\n\nHyundai is currently expanding its full-electric lineup by adding the Ioniq 6 to its lineup, which debuted in Europe in the second half of 2022, and in the United States in spring of 2023. Hyundai is also expanding its full-electric lineup with the Ioniq 7, which is projected to hit the market in 2024.[168]\n\n\n\n### Hydrogen vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Nexo\nIn March 2018, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered crossover SUV the Nexo.[169] In October 2020, South Korean domestic sales of the Nexo exceeded 10,000 vehicles.[170] As of July 2020, Hyundai had exported only 769 vehicles to the United States and Europe with supply limited due to domestic demand.[171][172]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered version of its Xcient truck the Xcient Fuel Cell delivering seven vehicles to customers in Switzerland.[173] The Xcient Fuel Cell is the world's first production hydrogen fuel cell truck.[173][174] In 2019, Hyundai formed Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility (HHM) together with Swiss company H2 Energy to lease trucks to Swiss customers with plans to deliver 50 trucks by 2020.[173] Hyundai chose to launch in Switzerland as its road tax does not apply to zero-emission trucks and for its ability to produce hydrogen using hydropower.[173] HHM formed a partnership with Hydrospider, a joint venture of H2Energy, Alpiq and Linde to produce hydrogen and to build hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in Switzerland.[175] The 34-ton Xcient Fuel Cell has a 190 kW fuel cell supported by a 73 kW battery pack that stores energy from the fuel cell and from braking, seven hydrogen tanks, a maximum speed of 85 km/h (53 mph), a driving range of about 400 kilometres (250 mi) and a refueling time of between 8 and 20 minutes.[174]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered version of its Elec City bus the Elec City FCEV that has a capacity of 44 passengers with 24 seats and 20 standing seats.[170][176] The bus has a 180 kW fuel cell supported by a 156 kW battery pack, five hydrogen tanks, a driving range of 434 kilometres (270 mi) and a refuelling time of 15 minutes.[176][177] In 2020, Hyundai exported two buses to Saudi Arabian oil company Saudi Aramco for demonstration.[178]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Hyundai suspended development of its Genesis, and possibly its other, hydrogen cars.[179]\n\n\n\n### Light commercial vehicles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

In September 1999, Hyundai unveiled the Accent WRC, a World Rally Car based on the Hyundai Accent. The Hyundai World Rally Team debuted the car at the 2000 Swedish Rally and achieved their first top-ten result at that year's Rally Argentina, when Alister McRae and Kenneth Eriksson finished seventh and eighth, respectively. Eriksson later drove the car to fifth place in New Zealand and fourth in Australia. In 2001, Hyundai debuted a new evolution of the Accent WRC, which was intended to improve reliability, but the performance of the car was still not good enough to challenge the four big teams (Ford, Mitsubishi, Peugeot and Subaru). However, at the season-ending Rally GB, the team achieved their best result with McRae finishing fourth and Eriksson sixth.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFor the 2002 season, Hyundai hired the four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, along with Freddy Loix and Armin Schwarz. Kankkunen's fifth place in New Zealand was the team's best result, but they managed to edge out Škoda and Mitsubishi by one point in the battle for fourth place in the manufacturers' world championship. In September 2003, after a season hampered by budget constraints, Hyundai announced withdrawal from the WRC and planned to return in 2006, which did not happen.[187]\n\n\nIn 2006, following the announcement that Korea was scheduled to earn a Formula One Grand Prix, Hyundai planned to enter the sport.[188] The Korean Grand Prix was first held in 2010, but Hyundai have not entered the championship. Hyundai announced they would be revealing their future rally plans at the 2011 Chicago Auto Show, on 9 February.[189] The current plans for rallying are focused around the newest Hyundai release, the Veloster.[190] In September 2012 Hyundai announced that they were due to start the WRC with a rally model of its i20 to rival the likes of the Ford Fiesta, the Citroen DS3 and the Mini Countryman.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n **Hyundai i20 WRC** \n\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai i20 WRC\nThe Hyundai i20 WRC is a World Rally Car built by Hyundai for use in the 2014 World Rally Championship.[191] It is based on the Hyundai i20 subcompact car, and was unveiled at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. The launch of the i20 marks Hyundai's return to the World Rally Championship after a ten-year absence.[192] The car is scheduled to make its first competitive appearance at the 2014 Rallye Monte Carlo, but may compete during the 2013 season to aid development.[193]\n\n\nThe car will be operated by Hyundai's performance division, Hyundai Motorsport from a base in Frankfurt, Germany.[194]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Corporate social responsibility[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Hyundai Motors established a committee to oversee its Corporate Social Responsibility programme.[195] Among the programme's initiatives have been the \"Happy Move Global Youth Volunteers Program\".[196]\n\n\nThe Hyundai Motors' India Foundation (HMIF) has invested more than 20 million rupees in various corporate social responsibility programmes in India. In 2011, it started the \"Go Green\" village adoption project in Tamil Nadu. Its aim was to promote environmentally friendly products, increase the forest cover in Tamil Nadu, and improve living and hygiene conditions in the region's villages. A number of schools have been adopted for improvement with the HMIF donating around 450 benches to government schools and drilling 10 bore wells.[197]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hyundai Motors signed a contract with UN Development Programme and launched a campaign ‘for Tomorrow’ in 2021 to create and realize a solution for problems that global society faces. In 2022, the documentary film 'for Tomorrow' was released which contains the main story of the 'for Tomorrow' project.[198]\n\n\n\n### Sports sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UEFA Euro 2012\n* BCCI\n* Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors FC\n* FIFA (Since 1999, except the FIFA Club World Cup)\n* International Cricket Council\n* UEFA (From 2000–2017)\n* Cricket World Cup (Until 2015)\n* Korea Football Association\n* A-League\n* Inside the NBA\n* National Football League[199]\n* Sun Bowl[200]\n* Hyundai Tournament of Champions\n* Olympique Lyonnais (from 2013 to 2020)\n* PFC CSKA Moscow\n* Millonarios Fútbol Club\n* Club Universitario de Deportes\n* Tampines Rovers FC\n* Al-Fateh SC\n* Moroka Swallows F.C.[201]\n* Mandurah City FC[202]\n* Park United FC[203]\n* Carlton Football Club[204]\n* Brisbane Lions\n* Brisbane Broncos\n* AS Cannes Volley-Ball\n* Hyundai Hockey Helpers[205]\n* Rhys Millen[206][207]\n* Atlético Madrid[208]\n* Hertha BSC\n* Chelsea FC\n* AS Roma\n\n### Other sponsorships[edit]\n\n\n* Academy Awards\n* CNN Worldwide\n* Hyundai Auto Club Philippines\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai Child Labor Scandal, Diesel emissions scandal, and Kia Challenge\n\n### Inflated fuel economy numbers[edit]\n\n\nAfter an investigation in 2012, the EPA found that 35% of all 2011–2013 Hyundai and Kia vehicles had inflated fuel economy numbers; by as much as six miles per gallon. Currently, Hyundai and Kia have started a reimbursement programme for the owners of the 2011–2013 affected vehicles.\n[209][210][211] In 2014 the company was issued $350 million in penalties by the US government, agreed to pay $395 million in 2013 to resolve claims from vehicles owners, and agreed to pay $41.2 million to cover the \"investigative costs\" of 33 US state attorneys general.[212]\n\n\n\n### Wrongly advertised engine and horsepower[edit]\n\n\nSeveral consumers complained that the engine delivered with the Hyundai Veloster in Brazil was inferior to the one advertised.[213] Independent tests confirmed that it was not the same engine, and it delivered only 121 CV (119 HP) instead of the advertised 140 CV (138 HP), with the car earning derogatory nicknames like Slowster in the Brazilian market.[214]\n\n\n\n### Marketing controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2013, Hyundai Motors UK released a commercial depicting a man attempting to commit suicide via carbon monoxide poisoning in an ix35, only to fail to do so because of the vehicle's non-toxic emissions. The advert, produced by Hyundai's in-house agency Innocean Worldwide, received widespread criticism for promoting suicide.[215] Hyundai has since taken down the video and issued a formal apology.[215][216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Bering Truck Corporation\n* Hyundai Group\n* Hyundai Mobis\n* Hyundai Motor Group\n* Kia Motors\n* List of Hyundai engines\n* List of Korean car makers\n* List of Hyundai Motor Company transmissions\n* List of Hyundai distributors world wide\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Pronunciations in English vary, and include:\n\n\n\t* /ˈh(j)ʌndeɪ/ *H(Y)UN-day*\n\t* /ˈh(j)ʌndaɪ/ *H(Y)UN-dye*\n\t* /haɪˈuːndaɪ/ *hy-OON-dye*\n\t* /hiˈʌndeɪ/ *hee-UN-day*\n\nThe closest English pronunciation to the original Korean would be /ˈhjʌndɛ/ *HYUN-deh*, but the final vowel is checked and cannot occur word-final in English.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hyundai Motor 2016 Fast Facts\".

It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and luxury cars under its Lincoln brand. Ford also owns a 32% stake in China's Jiangling Motors.[8] It also has joint ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), and Turkey (Ford Otosan). The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.[6][9]\n\n\nFord introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000, respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010.[10] In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.\n\n\nFord is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) and the sixth-largest in the world (behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, Stellantis, and General Motors) based on 2022 vehicle production.[11] At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth-largest automaker in Europe.[12] The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent of the voting rights.[6][13] During the financial crisis of 2007–08, the company struggled financially but did not have to be rescued by the federal government, unlike the other two major US automakers.[14][15] Ford Motors has since returned to profitability,[16] and was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion.[17] In 2008, Ford produced 5.532 million automobiles[18] and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ford Motor Company\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founder Henry Ford c. 1919\nThe Henry Ford Company was Henry Ford's first attempt at a car manufacturing company and was established on November 3, 1901. This became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name.[19] The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 (equivalent to $950,000 in 2023) in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). The first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen in order to assuage investors' fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later at its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade the company led the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house (vertical integration).\n\n\nHenry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. It has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first gasoline-powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz (Benz Patent-Motorwagen). More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for the middle class, to which Ford contributed by, for instance, introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at the Ford factory in Highland Park.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A 1910 Model T (introduced in 1908), photographed in Salt Lake City\nBetween 1903 and 1908, Ford produced the Models A, B, C, F, K, N, R, and S. Hundreds or a few thousand of most of these were sold per year. In 1908, Ford introduced the mass-produced Model T, which totaled millions sold over nearly 20 years. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the Model A, the first car with safety glass in the windshield.[20] Ford launched the first low-priced car with a V8 engine in 1932.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn an attempt to compete with General Motors' mid-priced Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick, Ford created the Mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to Ford. Henry Ford purchased the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922, in order to compete with such brands as Cadillac and Packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1929, Ford was contracted by the government of the Soviet Union to set up the Gorky Automobile Plant in Russia initially producing Ford Model A and AAs thereby playing an important role in the industrialization of that country.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)B-24 Liberator bombers being mass-produced at Ford's Willow Run assembly plant in 1944\nDuring World War II, the United States Department of War picked Ford to mass-produce the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber at its Willow Run assembly plant.[22] Ford Werke and Ford SAF (Ford's subsidiaries in Germany and France, respectively) produced military vehicles and other equipment for Nazi Germany's war effort. Some of Ford's operations in Germany at the time were run using forced labor.\n\n\nThe creation of a scientific laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan, in 1951, doing unfettered basic research, led to Ford's unlikely involvement in superconductivity research. In 1964, Ford Research Labs made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or SQUID.[23]\n\n\nFord offered the Lifeguard safety package from 1956, which included such innovations as a standard deep-dish steering wheel, optional front, and, for the first time in a car, rear seatbelts, and an optional padded dash.[24] Ford introduced child-proof door locks into its products in 1957, and, in the same year, offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car.[25]\n\n\nIn late 1955, Ford established the Continental division as a separate luxury car division. This division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous Continental Mark II. At the same time, the Edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year. Due to limited sales of the Continental and the Edsel disaster, Ford merged Mercury, Edsel, and Lincoln into \"M-E-L,\" which reverted to \"Lincoln-Mercury\" after Edsel's November 1959 demise.[25]\n\n\nThe Ford Mustang was introduced on April 17, 1964, during New York World's Fair (where Ford had a pavilion made by The Walt Disney Company).[26][27] In 1965, Ford introduced the seat belt reminder light.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the 1980s, Ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world. During the 1980s, Ford began using the advertising slogan, \"Have you driven a Ford, lately?\" to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern. In 1990 and 1994, respectively, Ford also acquired Jaguar Cars and Aston Martin.[28] During the mid-to-late 1990s, Ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles, in a booming American economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the dawn of the new century, legacy health care costs, higher fuel prices, and a faltering economy led to falling market shares, declining sales, and diminished profit margins. Most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through Ford Motor Credit Company.[29]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford, serves as the executive chairman at the board of Ford Motor Company.\nBy 2005, both Ford and GM's corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status[30] as a result of high U.S. health care costs for an aging workforce, soaring gasoline prices, eroding market share, and an overdependence on declining SUV sales. Profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased \"incentives\" (in the form of rebates or low-interest financing) to offset declining demand.[31] In the latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly appointed Ford Americas Division President Mark Fields to develop a plan to return the company to profitability. Fields previewed the plan, named *The Way Forward*, at the board meeting of the company on December 7, 2005, and it was unveiled to the public on January 23, 2006. \"The Way Forward\" included resizing the company to match market realities, dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models, consolidating production lines, closing 14 factories and cutting 30,000 jobs.[32]\n\n\nFord moved to introduce a range of new vehicles, including \"Crossover SUVs\" built on unibody car platforms, rather than more body-on-frame chassis. In developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the Ford Escape Hybrid SUV, the company licensed similar Toyota hybrid technologies[33] in order to avoid patent infringements.[34] Ford announced that it would team up with electricity supply company Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine the future of plug-in hybrids in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford is to convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE is to evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles are to be evaluated \"in typical customer settings\", according to Ford.[35][36]\n\n\nWilliam Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford (and better known by his nickname \"Bill\"), was appointed executive chairman in 1998, and also became chief executive officer of the company in 2001, with the departure of Jacques Nasser, becoming the first member of the Ford family to head the company since the retirement of his uncle, Henry Ford II, in 1982. Ford sold motorsport engineering company Cosworth to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven in 2004, the start of a decrease in Ford's motorsport involvement. Upon the retirement of president and chief operations officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed his roles as well. Five months later, in September, Ford named Alan Mulally as president and CEO, with Ford continuing as executive chairman. In December 2006, the company raised its borrowing capacity to about $25 billion, placing substantially all corporate assets as collateral.[37] Chairman Bill Ford has stated that \"bankruptcy is not an option\".[38] Ford and the United Auto Workers, representing approximately 46,000 hourly workers in North America, agreed to a historic contract settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues. The agreement included the establishment of a company-funded, independently run Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the company's books, thereby improving its balance sheet. This arrangement took effect on January 1, 2010. As a sign of its currently strong cash position, Ford contributed its entire current liability (estimated at US$5.5 billion as of December 31, 2009) to the VEBA in cash, and also pre-paid US$500 million of its future liabilities to the fund. The agreement also gave hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories.\n\n\n\n![](image)Horton Classic Car Museum, Nocona, Texas.\nThe automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of $12.7 billion,[39] and estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009.[40] However, Ford surprised Wall Street in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a $750 million profit. Despite the gains, the company finished the year with a $2.7 billion loss, largely attributed to finance restructuring at Volvo.[41]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2008, Ford sold its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors for $2.3 billion.[42][43]\n\n\nDuring congressional hearings held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., Ford's Alan Mulally stated that \"We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity. But we also must prepare ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions\". He went on to state that \"The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford\" and that Ford Motor Company supported both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis.[44][45] Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that \"In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company\".[46] GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through T.A.R.P. legislation funding provisions.[47]\n\n\nOn December 19, the cost of credit default swaps to insure the debt of Ford was 68 percent of the sum insured for five years, in addition to annual payments of 5 percent. That meant $6.8 million paid upfront to insure $10 million in debt, in addition to payments of $500,000 per year.[48] In January 2009, Ford reported a $14.6 billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt-for-equity exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position.[49] These actions yielded Ford a $2.7 billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's first full-year profit in four years.[50] In 2012, Ford's corporate bonds were upgraded from junk to investment grade again, citing sustainable, lasting improvements.[51]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Ford announced the sale of its climate control components business, its last remaining automotive components operation, to Detroit Thermal Systems LLC for an undisclosed price.[52]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2012, Ford announced that CEO Alan Mulally would stay with the company until 2014. Ford also named Mark Fields, its president of operations in the Americas, as its new chief operating officer[53] Mulally was paid a compensation of over $174 million in his previous seven years at Ford since 2006. The generous amount has been a sore point for some workers of the company.[54]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Ford announced a plan to modernize its Dearborn engineering and headquarters campuses through a ten-year building project. The result would see the number of Ford employees working in these areas doubling, to 24,000. During construction, some 2000 of the employees were relocated out of the campus to a temporary location in a disused section of the local shopping mall.[55] Facilities would also be altered to allow ride-sharing and electric and self-driving vehicles.[56] Estimates of the construction cost were $1.2 billion.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)The historic, once abandoned Michigan Central Station was purchased by Ford Motor Company in May 2018 and is expected to undergo a significant four-year renovation.\nOn January 3, 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that in a \"vote of confidence\" because of the pro-business climate being fostered in part by President-elect Donald Trump, Ford had canceled plans to invest $1.6 billion in a new plant in Mexico to manufacture the Ford Focus; instead, the company would invest $700 million in Michigan, which it planned to use to create 700 new jobs. The Focus would now be manufactured in the existing plant in Mexico.[58] Also in 2017, Ford began development of a new mixed-use urban campus in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit, with its purchase, renovation, and occupation of The Factory at Michigan and Rosa Parks. The new site was expected to have a major focus on the development of autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle technology.[59] Ford later began buying up other parcels of land in Corktown including a very high-profile purchase of Michigan Central Station which is planned to become the hub of their Corktown campus, and the adjacent Roosevelt Warehouse.[60] Ford expects to move 2,500 of its employees, roughly 5 percent of its southeast Michigan workforce, to the campus with space for an additional 2,500 entrepreneurs, technology companies and partners.[61] Bill Ford envisioned the first-floor concourse of the train station to be a public gathering place with retail outlets and restaurants.[62]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Ford Motor Co. acquired majority ownership of Argo AI, a self-driving car startup.[63]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Ford announced cuts to its global workforce amid efforts to address the company's declining share price and to improve profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a nearly 10% reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America to enhance earnings in 2018.[64][65] Jim Hackett was announced to replace Mark Fields as CEO of Ford Motor. Mr. Hackett most recently oversaw the formation of Ford Smart Mobility, a unit responsible for experimenting with car-sharing programs, self-driving ventures and other programs aimed at helping Ford better compete with Uber, Alphabet Inc. and other tech giants looking to edge in on the auto industry.[66][67]\n\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it would discontinue passenger cars in the North American market in the next four years, except for the Mustang, due to declining demand and profitability.[68] The Focus Active, a crossover SUV based on the newly unveiled fourth-generation Focus, was also intended to be marketed in the United States. Due to the vehicle being manufactured in China, Ford later announced that it would not release the Focus Active in the United States, due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese exports.[69][70]\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Detroit United Auto Workers union announced that after discussion with the leaders of General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the carmakers would partially shut down factories on a \"rotating\" basis to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.[71] On March 24, representatives of Ford announced that production in the US, Canada, and Mexico would not resume on March 30 as originally planned, amid the further coronavirus pandemic spread.[72] In the first quarter of 2020, Ford's sales dropped by 15%, entailing the loss of $2 billion.[73]\n\n\nWith the change in the demand for the sport vehicles, on January 6, 2021, Ford reported a sales fall of 9.8% in the fourth quarter, selling 542,749 vehicles, compared to 601,862 in 2019.[74]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Ford said that it would provide COVID-19 vaccines for its employees, who were to obtain them at the company; at the beginning the vaccination program would be in southeast Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, but it was to be expanded later on to other locations.[75]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Ford announced that it would restructure the company into three separate divisions. Ford Model E is to focus on electric vehicles; Ford Blue is to focus on internal combustion vehicles; and the existing commercial division is to be rebranded as Ford Pro, to focus on vehicle distribution and service.[76][7]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Ford announced it planned layoffs of roughly 3,000 employees and contract workers, confirming earlier reporting. The cuts would mostly affect divisions in the US, Canada, and India, which Jim Farley said would allow the company to prepare for the future of electric, software-heavy vehicles.[77][78]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Ford announced that it was going to cut 3,800 jobs across Europe, with the job cuts mainly focusing on their German and British workforce. Ford will be cutting 2,300 jobs from Germany, 1,300 from the United Kingdom, and an additional 200 jobs in the rest of Europe, according to the head of Ford Germany, Martin Sander. The cuts will mainly be done to the company's engineers.[79]\n\n\nFord announced that their electric vehicle business had lost $3 billion before taxes over the past two years and will lose a similar amount in 2023 as the company looks to significantly invest in Electric Technology. The Ford Model E is expected to be profitable by 2026.[80]\n\n\nIn April 2023, United Kingdom ministers approved Ford's BlueCruise technology. Because of this assisted driving technology, Ford drivers can now legally take their hands off the wheel on certain roads. Its top speed is 129 km/h (80 mph). BlueCruise uses sensors and cameras to regulate the car's speed and to keep track of speed limits and road signs. It also monitors and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles. It also comes equipped with an eye-tracking system. If the driver stops looking at the road then the car will gradually reduce its speed. This technology will initially be offered in Ford's 2023 model of the electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. \nAccording to Thatcham Research, an automotive research company, this model is not a self-driving car. It is classified as a level 2 or partial automation assistance system. This means that technology controls two or more driving aspects but still requires human driver control in cases of emergencies. The driver is still legally responsible for accidents.[81]\n\n\n\n### Logo evolution[edit]\n\n\n* ![1903](image)\n\n1903\n* ![1907](image)\n\n1907\n* ![1909](image)\n\n1909\n* ![1911](image)\n\n1911\n* ![1912](image)\n\n1912\n* ![1912 variant](image)\n\n1912 variant\n* ![1927](image)\n\n1927\n* ![1957](image)\n\n1957\n* ![1976](image)\n\n1976\n* ![2003](image)\n\n2003\n* ![2017](image)\n\n2017\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Executive management[edit]\n\n\nMembers of the Ford board as of March 2023[update] are: William Clay Ford Jr. (executive chairman), Jim Farley (president and CEO), Kimberly Casiano, Alexandra Ford English (daughter of William Clay Ford Jr.), Henry Ford III (son of Edsel Ford II), William W. Helman IV, Jon Huntsman Jr., William E. Kennard, John C. May, Beth E. Mooney, John L. Thornton, John Veihmeyer, Lynn Vojvodich Radakovich, and John S. Weinberg.[82]\n\n\nJim Farley succeeded Jim Hackett as the chief executive officer of the company in August, 2020; he previously served as Ford's chief operating officer. Hackett stayed in the company as an advisor until the second quarter of 2021.[83]\n\n\n\n## Ford Motor Company Fund[edit]\n\n\nThe Ford Motor Company Fund (also known as Ford Fund, not affiliated with the Ford Foundation), based in Dearborn, Michigan, is the philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company.[84] Established in 1949[85] by Henry Ford II,[*citation needed*] Ford Fund is a nonprofit corporate foundation[86] financed by contributions from Ford Motor Company. In 2017, Ford Fund contributed $63 million[87] to various causes[84] with a focus on education, driving safely and community building.\n\n\nThe Ford Driving Skills for Life program is a driver safety program aimed at teens that were developed together with the Governors Highway Safety Association and safety experts.[88] The Ford Volunteer Corps allows Ford employees and retirees to sign up for volunteering work on local projects in more than 40 countries.[89] The Ford Fund invests $18 million annually in education in the United States and around the world, but accepts applications only from nonprofit organizations registered in the U.S.[90] Education programs and scholarships include Alan Mulally Engineering Scholarship, Ford Blue Oval Scholars Program, Ford College Community Challenge (Ford C3), Ford Driving Dreams Tour, Ford Fund/Detroit Free Press Journalism Scholarship, Ford Next Generation Learning (Ford NGL), Grants to Individuals Program, HBCU Community Challenge, Smithsonian Latino Center Young Ambassadors Program, and William Clay Ford Automotive Design Scholarship.\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nFord has had manufacturing operations worldwide, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa. Ford also helped the Soviet Union to construct Russian automaker GAZ.\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford dealer in Garden City, New York, c. 1930–1945\nIn May 2010, Ford reported that its sales increased 23% for the month, and that 37% of its sales came from fleet sales.[91] In June 2010, sales to individual customers at dealerships increased 13% while fleet sales rose by 32%.[92] In the first seven months of 2010, fleet sales of Ford for the same period rose 35% to 386,000 units while retail sales increase 19%.[93] Fleet sales account for 39 percent of Chrysler's sales and 31 percent for GM's.[93]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford of Europe\n\n![](image)The Ford Research Center in Aachen, Germany, photographed in 2006\nAt first, Ford in Germany and Ford in Britain built different models from one another until 1965, when the Ford Transit and later the Ford Escort and the Ford Capri became common to both companies. In 1970, the Ford Taunus and the Ford Cortina came into production with a common base construction, both models being produced in left hand drive and right hand drive. Later on, the models became identical and the respective models right- and left-hand-drive exclusively. Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including Belgium and Spain as well as Germany. The Ford Sierra replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames, the \"Jellymould\" and \"The Salesman's Spaceship.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Ford's Dunton Technical Centre in Laindon, United Kingdom, the largest automotive research and development facility in the country,[94] pictured in 2006\nIn February 2002, Ford ended car production in the UK. It was the first time in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the Transit van continued at the company's Southampton facility until mid-2013, engines at Bridgend and Dagenham, and transmissions at Halewood. Development of European Ford is broadly split between Dunton in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka, and commercial vehicles) and Cologne (body, chassis, electrical, Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the Thames range of commercial vehicles, although the use of this brand name was discontinued with the introduction of the Ford Transit in 1965. Elsewhere in continental Europe, Ford assembles the Mondeo, Galaxy, S-Max[95] and Kuga[96] in Valencia (Spain), Fiesta in Cologne (Germany), Focus in Saarlouis (Germany), Ecosport[97] and Puma[98] in Craiova (Romania).\n\n\nFord also owns a joint-venture production plant in Turkey. Ford Otosan, established in the 1970s, manufactures the Transit Connect compact panel van as well as the \"Jumbo\" and long-wheelbase versions of the full-size Transit. This new production facility was set up near Kocaeli in 2002, and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk.\n\n\nAnother joint venture plant near Setúbal in Portugal, set up in collaboration with Volkswagen, formerly assembled the Galaxy people-carrier as well as its sister ships, the VW Sharan and SEAT Alhambra. With the introduction of the third generation of the Galaxy, Ford has moved the production of the people-carrier to the Genk plant, with Volkswagen taking over sole ownership of the Setúbal facility.\n\n\nIn 2008, Ford acquired a majority stake in Automobile Craiova, Romania. Starting 2009, the Ford Transit Connect was Ford's first model produced in Craiova, followed, in 2012, by low-capacity car engines and a new small class car, the B-Max.[99]\n\n\nIts 1959 Anglia two-door saloon was one of the most quirky-looking small family cars in Europe at the time of its launch, but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with British buyers in particular. It was still selling well when replaced by the more practical Escort in 1967.\n\n\nThe third incarnation of the Ford Escort was launched in 1980 and marked the company's move from rear-wheel-drive saloons to front-wheel-drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector.\n\n\nThe fourth-generation Escort was produced from 1990 until 2000, although its successor—the Focus—had been on sale since 1998. On its launch, the Focus was arguably the most dramatic-looking and fine-handling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next-generation Focus at the end of 2004.\n\n\nThe 1982 Ford Sierra—replacement for the long-running and massively popular Cortina and Taunus models—was a style-setter at the time of its launch. Its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy, sharp-edged Cortina, and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold. A series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel-drive Mondeo at the start of 1993.\n\n\nThe rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw Ford enter the mini-car market in 1976 with its Fiesta hatchback. Most of its production was concentrated at Valencia in Spain, and the Fiesta sold in huge figures from the very start. An update in 1983 and the launch of an all-new model in 1989 strengthened its position in the small car market.\n\n\nOn October 24, 2012, Ford announced that it would close its Genk assembly plant in eastern Belgium by the end of 2014.[100]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ford announced that it took control of Ford Sollers, Ford's joint venture with Russian company Sollers.[101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2018, at the IAA Commercial Vehicles show in Hannover, Germany, Ford introduced an electric tractor-trailer concept vehicle dubbed the F-Vision, which would have Level 4 autonomous driving capability.[103]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Ford announced that it was suspending its Sollers joint venture operation in Russia, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[104][105] On October 26, 2022, Ford sold its 49 percent share in the joint venture, and exited the Russian market,[106] adding that it retains the option to buy them back within a 5-year period “should the global situation change.[107]\n\n\n\n### East and Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord formed its first passenger-vehicle joint venture in China in 2001, six years behind GM and more than a decade after VW. It has spent as of 2013[update] $4.9 billion to expand its lineup and double production capacity in China to 600,000 vehicles. This includes Ford's largest-ever factory complex in the southwestern city of Chongqing. Ford had 2.5% of the Chinese market in 2013, while VW controlled 14.5% and GM had 15.6%, according to consultant LMC Automotive. GM outsells Ford in China by more than six-to-one.[108] Ford's presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller, confined to Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan, where Ford has had a joint venture with Lio Ho since the 1970s. Ford began assembly of cars in Thailand in 1960, but withdrew from the country in 1976, and did not return until 1995 when it formed a joint venture with Mazda called Auto Alliance.[109] Now based in the Bo-win Sub District of the Sriracha District in Chonburi, the factory still produces passenger automobiles. The factory, built in 1941 in Singapore, was soon taken over by the Japanese during the war and was the site of a surrender of the British to the Japanese, at the factory site which is now a national monument in Singapore.\nOn April 30, 2013, Ford Motor Co. launched their car and truck line in Myanmar. Previously, heavy importation taxes had stifled imported car purchases in Myanmar, but due to currency reform, lifting of previous import restrictions, and the abolishment of shadow currency, Myanmar's car market had grown in demand.[110]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea[edit]\n\n\nIn 1967, Ford partnered with the South Korean company Hyundai, and at the new factory in Ulsan, South Korea, built the European Ford Cortina until 1974 when Hyundai introduced their all-new Hyundai Pony in 1975. Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer Kia which built vehicles co-engineered with Mazda, later selling the Ford Festiva from 1988 to 1993, and the Ford Aspire from 1994 to 1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer Mazda in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's Familia and Capella as the Ford Laser and Telstar throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. From 1989 to 1996, Kia imported the Mercury Sable from Ford in the U.S. and sold them in South Korea as the Kia Sable. Though the Sable was branded and marketed as a Kia, it retained the Mercury badges and emblem. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; in 1998, Hyundai Motor Company acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986.[111] After subsequent divestments,[112] Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], Ford sells the Explorer, Mondeo, and Mustang,[113] as well as the Lincoln Aviator, Continental, Corsair, MKZ, and Nautilus in South Korea.[114]\n\n\n\n### South and West Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord India began production in 1998 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, with its Ford Escort model, which was later replaced by the locally produced Ford Ikon in 2001. It has since added the Fusion, Fiesta, Mondeo and Endeavour models to its product line.\n\n\nOn March 9, 2010, Ford launched its first made-for-India compact car. Starting at ₹349,900, the Figo was Ford's first car designed and priced for the mass Indian market.[115] On July 28, 2011, Ford India signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the State of Gujarat for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in Sanand and planned to invest approximately US$1 billion on a 460-acre site.[116] In 2019, the company and Mahindra & Mahindra formed a joint venture to develop, market and distribute Ford-branded vehicles in India.[117] In September 2021 Ford India announced plans to shut down both its assembly plants. The company said that it intends to maintain its parts and service network.[118]\n\n\nFord's market presence in the Middle East has traditionally been small, partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region.[119] Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest markets. Ford also established itself in Egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment.[120] Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were Ford Crown Victorias.[121] In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of General Motors' 88,852 units and Nissan Motors' 75,000 units.\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford assembly plant in General Pacheco, Argentina, as seen in the 1960s\nIn South America, Ford's primary operations are in Brazil, Argentina, and Ford Andina[122] (Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela). Ford employs over 18,000 people and operates seven assembly or other plants in the region.[123] In 1987, Ford Brasil and Ford Motor Argentina merged their operations with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group, forming a new joint-venture company called Autolatina with a shared model range.[124] Autolatina was dissolved in 1995.[124]\n\n\nIn early 2021, Ford's Brazil branch announced it would completely cease production in the country over the course of a few months.[125]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn Africa, Ford's market presence has traditionally been strongest in South Africa and neighbouring countries, with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent. Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its facility in Port Elizabeth; the company later sourced its models from the UK and Australia, with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6, with a 3.0 V6 engine, and a Cortina-based 'bakkie' or pick-up, which was exported to the UK. In the mid-1980s Ford merged with a rival company, owned by Anglo American, to form the South African Motor Corporation (Samcor).[126]\n\n\nFollowing international condemnation of apartheid, Ford divested from South Africa in 1988, and sold its stake in Samcor, although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company.[127] Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well, which affected its product line-up and saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the Mazda-based Laser[128] and Telstar.[129] Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in Samcor following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and this later became, once again, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta (also built in India and Mexico), and the Focus. The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa, but was dropped in 2003; the Mondeo, after briefly being assembled locally, was dropped in 2005. The Mondeo was later reintroduced in 2015, badged as the Fusion, but was dropped in 2017.[130]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nFord Research and Innovation Center is the name of the technology research facilities of Ford Motor Company in\n\n\n\n* Dearborn, Michigan\n* Palo Alto, California\n* Aachen, Germany\n* Nanjing, China\n\n\nThe Ford Research and Innovation Center in Palo Alto was first opened in 2012, and in January 2015, announced plans to significantly expand its operations.[131][132][133][134]\n\n\n\n## Former operations[edit]\n\n\n### East and Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord decided to shut down their entire operations in Indonesia, including their dealer network by second half of 2016.[135][136]\n\n\n\n#### Ford of Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Motor Company of Japan\n\nFord established a manufacturing facility in the port city of Yokohama in February 1925, where Model T vehicles were assembled using imported knock-down kits.[137] The factory subsequently produced 10,000 Model A's up to 1936. Production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between Japan and the United States.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Ford did not have a presence in Japan, as the Ford facility was appropriated by the Japanese Government until 1958 when property was returned as a possession of the Ford Motor Company and became a research and development location for Ford partner Mazda. In 1979, Ford acquired a 24.5% ownership stake in Mazda, and in 1982, Ford and Mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell Ford products in Japan, including vehicles manufactured in North America, at a dealership called *Autorama (Japanese)*. The Autorama sales channel was renamed Ford Sales of Japan in 1997.[138]\n\n\nVehicles sold at *Autorama* locations were the North American assembled Ford Explorer, Probe (1989–1998), Mustang, Taurus (1989–1997), Thunderbird (1990–1993), Lincoln Continental, and Lincoln LS. Ford products manufactured in Europe that were sold in Japan were the Ford Mondeo, Ka, Focus, Focus C-MAX, Fiesta, and the Galaxy. Mazda manufactured Ford vehicles in Japan and sold them as Fords at the Autorama locations. They were the Ford Telstar (Mazda Capella), Laser, Festiva, Festiva Mini Wagon, Ixion (Mazda Premacy), Freda (Mazda Bongo Friendee), Spectron (Mazda Bongo), and commercial trucks J80 and the J100 (Mazda Bongo truck).\n\n\nFord increased its shareholding in Mazda to 33.4% in 1996, but as of July 2016[update], it is listed at 11%.[139] Ford did sell a small range of vehicles in Japan; as of October 2010[update], the Ford Mustang, Escape, Explorer (and Explorer truck), Ford Kuga, Lincoln Navigator, Lincoln MKX, and more recently, the Ford Ecosport were available in Japan. As of February 2016[update], Ford no longer maintains a regional office in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, and sales of new cars in Japan have ended.[140][141]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford FG X Falcon (Australia) (2014–2016; 2014 model shown)\n![](image)The Ford stamping plant in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. It closed in 2016.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the popular Ford Falcon (1960–2016) had long been considered the average family car and is considerably larger than the Mondeo, Ford's largest car sold in Europe. Between 1960 and 1972, the Falcon was based on a U.S. model of the same name, but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured in Australia until 2016, occasionally being manufactured in New Zealand. Like its General Motors rival, the Holden Commodore, the Falcon used a rear-wheel-drive layout. High-performance variants of the Falcon running locally built engines produce up to 362 hp (270 kW). A ute (short for \"utility\", known in the U.S. as pickup truck) version is also available with the same range of drivetrains. In addition, Ford Australia sold highly tuned limited-production Falcon sedans and utes through its performance car division, Ford Performance Vehicles until it closed in 2014.\n\n\nIn Australia, the Commodore and Falcon had traditionally outsold all other cars and constituted over 20% of the new car market. In New Zealand, Ford was second in market share in the first eight months of 2006 with 14.4%.[142] More recently, Ford has axed its Falcon-based LWB variant of its lineup– the Fairlane and LTD ranges. Ford discontinued the Fairlane in 2007 and LTD in 2008. Ford had announced that their Geelong engine manufacturing plant would be shut down between 2013 and 2016. They had earlier announced local manufacturing of the Focus small car starting from 2011, but instead decided to import the model from Ford's plant in Thailand.[143]\n\n\nIn Australia, the Laser was one of Ford Australia's most successful models and was manufactured in Ford's Homebush West plant from 1981 until the plant's closure in September 1994. It outsold the Mazda 323, despite being almost identical to it because the Laser was manufactured in Australia and Ford was perceived as a local brand.[144] According to research carried out by Ford Australia in 1984, a third of Laser buyers were unaware that the Ford model was based on the Mazda 323.[145]\n\n\nIn New Zealand, the Ford Laser and Telstar were assembled alongside the Mazda 323 and 626 until 1997, at the Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in Wiri, Auckland.[146] The Sierra wagon was also assembled in New Zealand, owing to the popularity of station wagons in that market.[147]\n\n\nThe scheduled closure of Ford's Australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed on May 23, 2013. Headquartered in the Victorian suburb of Broadmeadows, the company had registered losses worth AU$600 million over the five years prior to the announcement. It was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that account for two-thirds of large, local car sales in Australia are insufficient to keep Ford's products profitable and viable in Australia. The decision will affect 1200 Ford workers—over 600 employees in Geelong and more than 500 in Broadmeadows—who will lose their jobs by October 2016. The closure of Ford's plants in Norlane Geelong and Broadmeadows Melbourne occurred on October 7, 2016.[148]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n### Automobiles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Ford vehicles, List of Lincoln vehicles, and List of Mercury vehicles\n\n![](image)The 2017 model year F-150\nFord Motor Company sells a broad range of automobiles under the Ford marque worldwide, and an additional range of luxury automobiles under the Lincoln marque in the United States. The company has sold vehicles under a number of other marques during its history. The Mercury brand was introduced by Ford in 1939, continuing in production until 2011 when poor sales led to its discontinuation.[149] In 1958, Ford introduced the Edsel brand, but poor sales led to its discontinuation in 1960. In 1985, the Merkur brand was introduced in the United States to market products produced by Ford of Europe; it was discontinued in 1989.\n\n\nFord acquired the British sports car maker Aston Martin in 1989, later selling it on March 12, 2007,[150] although retaining an 8% stake.[151][152] Ford purchased Volvo Cars of Sweden in 1999,[153] selling it to Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in 2010.\n\n\nIn November 2008, it reduced its 33.4% controlling interest in Mazda of Japan to a 13.4% non-controlling interest.[154] On November 18, 2010, Ford reduced their stake further to just 3%, citing the reduction of ownership would allow greater flexibility to pursue growth in emerging markets. Ford and Mazda remain strategic partners through exchanges of technological information and joint ventures, including an American joint venture plant in Flat Rock, Michigan called Auto Alliance.[155] In 2015, Ford sold its remaining 3% stake in Mazda.[156]\n\n\nFord sold the United Kingdom-based Jaguar and Land Rover companies and brands to Tata Motors of India in March 2008.\n\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it planned to phase out all but one of its North American automobile models (the Mustang will be the sole surviving model) to focus primarily on trucks and SUVs. Ford had also planned to introduce an \"Active\" crossover version of the next-generation Focus, but canceled those plans due to tariff issues between the United States and China.[157]\n\n\n\n### Trucks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1939 Ford V-8 pick-up truck\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1961 Ford H-Series truck\nFord has produced trucks since 1908, beginning with the Ford Model TT, followed by the Model AA, and the Model BB. Countries where Ford commercial vehicles are or were formerly produced include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada (also badged as Mercury), France, Germany, India, Netherlands, Philippines, Spain (badged Ebro too), Turkey, UK (badged also Fordson and Thames), and the United States.\n\n\nFrom the 1940s to the late 1970s, Ford's Ford F-Series was used as the base for light trucks for the North American market.\n\n\nMost of these ventures are now extinct. The European one that lasted longest was the lorries arm of Ford of Britain, which became part of the Iveco group in 1986. Ford had a minority share in the new company and Iveco took over sales and production of the Ford Cargo range.[158] Ford's last significant European truck models were the Transcontinental and the Cargo. At the end of 1996, Ford sold the rights to its heavy trucks division to the Freightliner Trucks division of Daimler AG, with Ford producing the Cargo, Louisville, and Aeromax, through the 1998 model year. During the 1998 model year, Freightliner began production of its own versions of Ford-developed trucks in St. Thomas, Ontario, launching the Sterling truck brand.[159][160] Slotted between Freightliner and Western Star, Sterling trucks were produced through 2009.\n\n\nLine of heavy trucks made by Ford for the North American market:\n\n\n\n* Ford F-Series\n\t+ \"Big Job\" (1951-1957)\n\t+ \"Super Duty/Extra Heavy Duty (1958-1962)\n* Ford N-Series (1963-1969)\n* Ford L-Series trucks (1970-1998)\n\t+ aka Ford \"Louisville Line\"\n\t+ Ford Aeromax (1988-1998)\n\t+ Ford Louisville (1996-1998)\n\t+ Sterling (1998-2009)\n* Ford C-Series (1957-1990)\n* Ford Cargo/CF-Series (1986-1997)\n* Ford H-Series (1961-1966)\n\t+ aka \"Two-story Falcon\"\n* Ford W-Series (1966-1977)\n* Ford CL-Series (1978-1995)\n\n\nFor 1999, Ford briefly withdrew from production of medium-duty trucks. For the 2001 model year, the company entered into a joint venture with Navistar International (the supplier of diesel engines for 1-ton F-Series trucks), named *Blue Diamond Truck Company LLC*.[161] As part of the joint venture, sharing a common truck chassis, the two companies would produce medium-duty (Class 6–7) trucks in a Navistar facility in Mexico, with each manufacturer supplying its own powertrain and bodywork, with the Ford F-650/F-750 Super Duty and International 4000/DuraStar sharing an assembly line. In 2006, the joint venture debuted the Ford LCF/International CityStar.[162] Using a modified F-Series chassis adopted to fit a Mazda Titan cab, the LCF was a low-cab forward truck that was sold through 2009.[163]\n\n\nIn Europe, Ford manufactures the Ford Transit jumbo van, which is classed as a Large Goods Vehicle and has a payload of up to 2,265 kg; there are options of a panel van, pickup or chassis cab. The Ford Transit is also available as a light van called the Ford Transit Connect and the Ford Ranger pickup is available.[164]\n\n\n\n### Buses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford B700 bus chassis, with a body by Thomas Built\nFord manufactured complete buses in the company's early history, but today the role of the company has changed to that of a second stage manufacturer. In North America, the E-Series is still used as a chassis for small school buses and the F-650 is used in commercial bus markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, the medium-duty B700 was a popular chassis used by school bus body manufacturers including Thomas Built, Ward, and Blue Bird, but Ford lost its market share due to industry contraction and agreements between body manufacturers. Older bus models included:\n\n\nPrior to 1936, Ford buses were based on truck bodies:\n\n\n\n* Model B – 1930s\n* Model T – 1920s\n* F-105 school bus\n\n\n![](image)A 1937 Ford Transit Bus in Seattle\nIn 1936, Ford introduced the Ford Transit Bus, a series of small transit buses with bodies built by a second party. Originally a front-engine design, it was modified to a rear-engine design in 1939. About 1,000 to 1,200 of the original design were built, and around 12,500 of the rear-engine design, which was in production until 1947[165] (rebranded as the Universal Bus in 1946).\n\n\nRear-engine Transit Bus chassis model numbers:[166]\n\n\n\n* 09-B/19-B City transit bus – 1939–1941\n* 19-B/29-B City transit bus – 1941–1942\n* 49-B/79-B City transit bus – 1944–1947\n* 69-B City transit bus – 1946–1947\n* 29-B City transit bus – 1946–1947\n* 72-T transit bus – 1944–1945\n\n\nAfter 1946 the Transit City bus was sold as the *Universal Bus* with the roof changed from fabric/wood to all-metal:\n\n\n\n* 79-B Universal transit bus – 1946–1947\n\n\nSucceeding the Ford Transit Bus was the Ford 8M buses:\n\n\n\n* 8MB transit bus – with Wayne Works 1948–?\n\n\nFollowing World War II and from the 1950s onwards, Ford lost out to General Motors.[166] This led to the end of transit buses for Ford in North America.\n\n\n\n* B500 or B-series – 1950–1990s based on Ford F-series truck chassis used by school bus body manufacturers\n\n\nIn Europe, Ford manufactures the Ford Transit Minibus which is classed in Europe as a Passenger Carrying Vehicle and there are options of 12-, 15-, or 17-seaters.[167] In the past, European models included:\n\n\n\n* EM\n* N-138\n* D series buses (Australia)\n\n\n### Tractors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford N series tractor\nThe \"Henry Ford and Son Company\" began making Fordson tractors in Henry's hometown of Springwells (later part of Dearborn), Michigan, from 1907 to 1928, from 1919 to 1932, at Cork, Ireland, and between 1933 and 1964 at Dagenham, England, later transferred to Basildon. They were also produced in Leningrad beginning in 1924.\n\n\nFord reentered the tractor market in 1939 with the Ford N-series tractors. The Ford 8N, introduced in 1947, became the most popular tractor of all time in North America. Production of the N line of models ended in 1952.\n\n\nThe Ford NAA tractor was introduced as an entirely new model in 1953. It was a replacement for the Ford N-Series tractors. Larger than the 8N, with a four-cylinder engine, and streamlined styling.\n\n\nIn 1986, Ford expanded its tractor business when it purchased the Sperry-New Holland skid-steer loader and hay baler, hay tools and implement company from Sperry Corporation and formed Ford-New Holland which bought out Versatile tractors in 1988. This company was bought by Fiat in 1993 and the name changed from Ford New Holland to New Holland. New Holland is now part of CNH Global.\n\n\n\n### Financial services[edit]\n\n\nFord offers automotive finance through Ford Motor Credit Company.\n\n\n\n### Automotive components[edit]\n\n\nFord's *FoMoCo* parts division sells aftermarket parts under the Motorcraft brand name. It has spun off its parts division under the name Visteon.\n\n\n\n## FordWorks Program[edit]\n\n\nFord Motor Company created the FordWorks program in 2016[168][169] with the aim to bring people with disabilities back into the workforce.[170] It was the first automotive program to focus on bringing people with autism in the workforce in the US. They targeted people with autism[168][169] but have expanded their criteria to people with other disabilities.[170] Ford has partnered with Upbound to broaden their hiring under the FordWorks program.[170]\n\n\n\n## Marques[edit]\n\n\n### Current marques[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Marque\n | Estab.\n | Added | Markets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) US | Ford | 1903 | 1903 | Global\n |\n| ![](image) US | Lincoln | 1917 | 1922 | North America, Middle East, China, South Korea\n |\n\n\n### Former marques[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Marque\n | Years | Markets\n | Fate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) US | Continental[171][172] | 1956–1986 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) US | Edsel | 1957–1960 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) US | Fordson | 1917–1964 | North America, Ireland, U.K. | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) US | Mercury | 1939–2011 | North America, Middle East | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) US | Merkur | 1985–1989 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) AUS | FPV | 2002–2014 | Australia | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) BRA | Troller | 2007–2021 | Brazil | Defunct company, plant closed by Ford Brasil |\n| ![](image) JPN | Mazda | 1974–2015 | Global | Sold shares\n |\n| ![](image) SWE | Volvo | 1999–2010 | Global | Sold to Geely |\n| ![](image) UK | Aston Martin | 1989–2007 | Global | Sold to a private consortium\n |\n| ![](image) UK | Jaguar | 1989–2008 | Global | Sold to Tata Motors |\n| ![](image) UK | Land Rover | 2000–2008 | Global | Sold to Tata Motors |\n| ![](image) ITA | De Tomaso | 1971–1974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image) ITA | Moto Guzzi | 1973–1974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image) ITA | Benelli | 1972–1974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image) CAN | Meteor | 1949–1976 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) CAN | Monarch | 1946–1961 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) CAN | Frontenac | 1960 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n\n\n## Motorsport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Performance\n\n### FIA World Championships[edit]\n\n\nAlong with Shelby and Chevrolet, Ford is one of only three American constructors to win titles on the international scene at the FIA World Championships. As a constructor, Ford won the World Sportscar Championship three times in 1966 (both sports prototype category and Grand Touring (GT) category), 1967 (GT category), and 1968 (sports prototype category), and at the World Rally Championship Ford won 4 World Drivers' Championships (in 1979, 1981, 2017 and 2018) as well as 4 World Manufacturers' Championships (in 1979, 2006, 2007 and 2017). As an engine supplier, Ford also won 13 Formula One World Drivers' Championships and 10 Formula One World Constructors' Championships.\n\n\n\n### Open-wheel racing[edit]\n\n\n#### IndyCar[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arie Luyendyk's record-setting Ford Cosworth-powered IndyCar from 1996\nIndyCars with Ford engines first competed in 1935 using a production-based Ford V8 in the Miller-Ford racer.[173][174] A pushrod Ford V8 raced with Lotus in 1963, and Ford's first Indy win was in 1965 with a DOHC V8.[175][176] Ford motors, including the Ford-sponsored DFX engine developed by Cosworth, have won the Indianapolis 500 eighteen times.[177] On May 12, 1996, Arie Luyendyk, while driving an IndyCar powered by a Ford Cosworth XB engine, broke the Indianapolis 500 records for fastest qualification lap (237.498 mph; 382.216 km/h) and fastest qualification four-lap average (236.986 mph; 381.392 km/h).[178][179] These speed records still stand as of 2022[update].[180]\n\n\n\n#### Formula Ford[edit]\n\n\nFormula Ford, conceived in the UK in 1966, is an entry-level type of formula racing with wingless single-seater cars. Many of today's formula racing drivers started their car racing careers in this category.\n\n\n\n#### Formula One[edit]\n\n\nFord was heavily involved in Formula One for many years and supplied engines to a large number of teams from 1967 until 2004. These engines were designed and manufactured by Cosworth, the racing division that was owned by Ford from 1998 to 2004. Ford-badged engines won 176 Grands Prix between 1967 and 2003 for teams such as Team Lotus and McLaren. Ford entered Formula One as a constructor in 2000 under the Jaguar Racing name, after buying the Stewart Grand Prix team which had been its primary 'works' team in the series since 1997. Jaguar achieved little success in Formula One, and after a turbulent five seasons, Ford withdrew from the category after the 2004 season, selling both Jaguar Racing (which became Red Bull Racing) and Cosworth (to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven).[181]\n\n\nFord has announced that it will return to Formula One in 2026 following a partnership with Red Bull Powertrains, supplying power units to Red Bull Racing and Scuderia AlphaTauri.[182]\n\n\n\n### Stock car racing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ryan Blaney driving the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford in 2016 at Michigan International Speedway\nFord is one of three manufacturers in NASCAR's three major series: the Cup Series, Xfinity Series, and Truck Series. Major teams include RFK Racing, Team Penske, Stewart-Haas Racing, and Wood Brothers Racing. Ford is represented by the Mustang GT in the Cup Series, and the Xfinity Series and by the F-150 in the Truck Series. Some of the most successful NASCAR Fords were the aerodynamic fastback Ford Torino, Ford Torino Talladega, Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II, and Mercury Montegos, and the aero-era Ford Thunderbirds. The Ford nameplate has won eight manufacturer's championships in Sprint Cup while Mercury has won one. In the Sprint Cup Series, Ford earned its 1,000th victory in the 2013 Quicken Loans 400.[183] The Ford Fusion is also used in the ARCA Racing Series. Ford had last won a drivers' championship in the Cup Series with Joey Logano in 2022.\n\n\n\n### Rally[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford World Rally Team\n\n![](image)Jari-Matti Latvala driving the Ford Focus RS WRC 09 in 2010\nFord has a long history in rallying and has been active in the World Rally Championship since the beginning of the world championship, the 1973 season. Ford took the 1979 manufacturers' title with Hannu Mikkola, Björn Waldegård, and Ari Vatanen driving the Ford Escort RS1800. In the Group B era, Ford achieved success with Ford RS200. Since the 1999 season, Ford has used various versions of the Ford Focus WRC to much success. In the 2006 season, BP-Ford World Rally Team secured Ford its second manufacturers' title, with the Focus RS WRC 06 built by M-Sport and driven by \"Flying Finns\" Marcus Grönholm and Mikko Hirvonen.[184] Continuing with Grönholm and Hirvonen, Ford successfully defended the manufacturers' world championship in the 2007 season. Ford is the only manufacturer to score in the points for 92 consecutive races; since the 2002 season opener Monte Carlo Rally.[185]\n\n\n\n### Rallycross[edit]\n\n\nFord has competed in rallycross with its Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus. Tanner Foust won the Global RallyCross Championship in 2011 and 2012 and was runner-up in the FIA European Rallycross Championship in 2011 and 2012. Toomas Heikkinen won the Global RallyCross Championship title in 2013 and Joni Wiman won it in 2014. Other notable Ford drivers include Marcus Grönholm, Ken Block, and Brian Deegan.\n\n\n\n### Sports cars[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford GT § Racing\n\nFord sports cars have been visible in the world of sports car racing since 1964. Most notably the Ford GT40 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times (in 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969) and is the only American car to ever win overall at this prestigious event. Ford also won four titles at the World Sportscar Championship with the GT40. Swiss team Matech GT Racing, in collaboration with Ford Racing, opened a new chapter with the Ford GT, winning the Teams title in the 2008 FIA GT3 European Championship.\n\n\n\n#### Ford Mustang[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Mustang § Racing\n\n![](image)A GT racing version of the Ford Mustang, competing in the Koni Challenge in 2005\nThe Ford Mustang has arguably been Ford's most successful sports car. Jerry Titus won the 1965 SCCA Pro B National Championship with a Mustang and the model went on to earn Ford the SCCA Trans-Am Championship title in both 1966 and 1967. Ford won the Trans-Am Championship again in 1970 with Parnelli Jones and George Follmer driving Boss 302 Mustangs for Bud Moore Engineering. Ford took the 1985 and 1986 IMSA GTO Championship with Mustangs driven by John Jones and Scott Pruett before returning to Trans-Am glory with a championship in 1989 with Dorsey Schroeder. Ford dominated Trans-Am in the 1990s with Tommy Kendall winning championships in 1993, 1995, 1996, and 1997 with Paul Gentilozzi adding yet another title in 1999. In 2005 the Ford Mustang FR500C took the championship in the Rolex Koni Challenge Series in its first year on the circuit. In 2007, Ford added a victory in the GT4 European Championship. 2008 was the first year of the Mustang Challenge for the Miller Cup, a series that pits a full field of identical factory-built Ford Mustang race cars against each other. Also, in 2008, Ford won the manufacturers championship in the Koni Challenge Series and HyperSport drivers Joe Foster and Steve Maxwell won the drivers title in a Mustang GT.\n\n\nFord and Michelin teamed up to provide custom-engineered tires for the Ford Performance vehicle lineup. Ford Performance director Dave Pericak said: \"That confidence extends from our upcoming racing effort at Le Mans in 2016 with the all-new Ford GT, to the Ford Performance vehicle lineup, including the Shelby GT350 and F-150 Raptor\".[186]\n\n\n\n### Touring cars[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford Performance Racing Ford Falcon V8 Supercar at Eastern Creek in Australia in 2008\nFord has campaigned touring cars such as the Focus, Falcon, and Contour/Mondeo and the Sierra Cosworth in many different series throughout the years. Notably, Mondeo drivers finished 1, 2, and 3 in the 2000 British Touring Car Championship and Falcon drivers placed 1, 2, and 3 in the 2005 V8 Supercar Championship Series.\n\n\n\n### Drag racing[edit]\n\n\nIn drag racing, John Force Racing drivers John Force, Tony Pedregon, and Robert Hight have piloted Ford Mustang Funny Cars to several NHRA titles in recent seasons. Teammates Tim Wilkerson and Bob Tasca III also drive Mustangs in Funny Car.\n\n\n\n### Drifting[edit]\n\n\nFord has branched out into drifting with the introduction of the new model Mustang. Most noticeable is the Turquoise and Blue Falken Tires Mustang driven by Vaughn Gittin, Jr., (A.K.A. \"JR\") that produces 750 RWHP (Rear Wheel Horsepower).\n\n\n\n## Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\n### Compressed natural gas[edit]\n\n\nThe alternative fossil fuel vehicles, such as some versions of the Crown Victoria especially in fleet and taxi service, operate on compressed natural gas—or CNG. Some CNG vehicles have dual fuel tanks—one for gasoline, the other for CNG—the same engine can operate on either fuel via a selector switch.\n\n\n\n### Flexible fuel vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Ford Focus Flexifuel was the first E85 flexible fuel vehicle commercially available in the European market.\nFlexible fuel vehicles are designed to operate smoothly using a wide range of available ethanol fuel mixtures—from pure gasoline to bioethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) or E100 (neat hydrous ethanol) in Brazil. Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles in the U.S. is the general lack of establishment of sufficient fueling stations, which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive to a wide range of consumers. Significant efforts to ramp up production and distribution of E85 fuels are underway and expanding.[187] Current Ford E100 Flex sold in the Brazilian market are the Courier, Ford EcoSport, Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus, and Ford Ka.\n\n\n\n### Electric drive vehicles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Bush at the Kansas City Assembly plant in Claycomo, Missouri, on March 20, 2007, touting Ford's new hybrid cars\nIn 2004, Ford and Toyota agreed a patent-sharing accord that granted Ford access to certain hybrid technology patented by Toyota; in exchange, Ford licensed some of its own patents to Toyota.[188][189][190] In 2004, Ford introduced the Escape Hybrid. With this vehicle, Ford was third to the automotive market with a hybrid electric vehicle and the first hybrid electric SUV to market. This was also the first hybrid electric vehicle with a flexible fuel capability to run on E85.[191] The Escape's platform mate Mercury Mariner was also available with the hybrid-electric system in the 2006 model year—a full year ahead of schedule. The similar Mazda Tribute will also receive a hybrid-electric powertrain option, along with many other vehicles in the Ford vehicle line.\n\n\nIn 2005, Ford announced a goal to make 250,000 hybrids a year by 2010, but by mid-2006 announced that it would not meet that goal, due to excessively high costs and the lack of sufficient supplies of the hybrid-electric batteries and drivetrain system components.[192] Instead, Ford has committed to accelerating development of next-generation hybrid-electric power plants in Britain, in collaboration with Volvo. This engineering study is expected to yield more than 100 new hybrid-electric vehicle models and derivatives.\n\n\nIn September 2007, Ford announced a partnership with Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine how plug-in hybrids will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles will be evaluated \"in typical customer settings\", according to Ford.[35][36]\n\n\nOn June 12, 2008, USDOE expanded its own fleet of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with the addition of a Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid Flex-Fuel Vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a 10-kilowatt (13 hp) lithium-ion battery supplied by Johnson Controls-Saft that stores enough electric energy to drive up to 30 miles (48 km) at speeds of up to 40 mph (64 km/h).[193] In March 2009, Ford launched hybrid versions of the Ford Fusion Hybrid and the Mercury Milan Hybrid in the United States, both as 2010 models.[194]\n\n\nAs of November 2014[update], Ford has produced for retail sales the following hybrid electric vehicles: Ford Escape Hybrid (2004–2012), Mercury Mariner Hybrid (2005–2010), Mercury Milan Hybrid (2009–2010), Ford Fusion Hybrid (2009–present), Lincoln MKZ Hybrid (2010–present), Ford C-Max Hybrid (2012–present), and Ford Mondeo Hybrid (2014–present). By June 2012, Ford had sold 200,000 full hybrids in the U.S. since 2004,[195] and, as of September 2014[update], the carmaker has sold over 344,000 hybrids in the United States.[195][196][197][198] The top selling hybrids in the U.S. market are the Fusion Hybrid with 127,572 units, followed by Escape Hybrid with 117,997 units, and the C-Max Hybrid with 54,236.[196][197][198][199][200] As of November 2014[update], Ford is the world's second-largest manufacturer of hybrids after Toyota Motor Corporation, with 400,000 hybrid electric vehicles produced since their introduction in 2004.[201]\n\n\n\n#### Plug-in electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Plug-in electric vehicle\n\nAs of October 2014[update], Ford has produced the following plug-in electric vehicles: the all-electric Ford Ranger EV (1997–2002), Ford TH!NK (1999–2003), Transit Connect (2010–2012), and Ford Focus Electric (2011–2018); and the plug-in hybrids C-MAX Energi (2012–2017) and the Fusion Energi (2013–2020), sold under the Mondeo nameplate in Europe.[202][203] Since the launch of the Focus Electric in 2011, combined sales of all Ford plug-in electric models amounted to just over 56,000 through October 2015.[204]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Azure Transit Connect Electric was produced between 2010 and 2012 as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company.\nBill Ford was one of the first top industry executives to make regular use of a battery electric vehicle, a Ford Ranger EV, while the company contracted with the United States Postal Service to deliver electric postal vans based on the Ranger EV platform. Ford discontinued a line of electric Ranger pickup trucks and ordered them destroyed, though it reversed in January 2005, after environmentalist protest.[205] The all-electric pickup truck leased 205 units to individuals and 1,500 units to fleets in the U.S. from 1998 to 2002.[206][207]\n\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Ford offered the Ford TH!NK car. Ford ended production and ordered all the cars repossessed and destroyed, even as many of the people leasing them begged to be able to buy the cars from Ford. After an outcry from the lessees and activists in the U.S. and Norway, Ford returned the cars to Norway for sale.[208] Four hundred and forty units were leased in the U.S. from 1999 until 2003.[207]\n\n\nIn 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that the company would invest $4.5 billion in further development of plug-in electric vehicles by 2020.[209]\n\n\nThe Azure Transit Connect Electric was an all-electric van developed as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company, but Azure was the official manufacturer of record.[210] The Transit Connect Electric had an official U.S. Environmental Protection Agency all-electric range of 56 mi (90 km).[211] The EPA rated the combined city/highway fuel economy at 62 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (3.8 L/100 km equivalent).[211] Deliveries for fleet customers in the U.S. and Canada began in December 2010.[212] Production of the electric van was stopped in March 2012 as a result of Azure's bankruptcy protection filing. Ford continues to provide servicing.[213] Around 500 units were sold before Azure stopped production.[214]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid shares its powertrain with the Ford C-Max Energi.\nThe Ford Focus Electric is based on the next generation Focus internal combustion vehicle, converted to an all-electric propulsion system as a production electric car by Magna International, and retail sales began in the U.S. in December 2011.[215][216] The Focus Electric has an EPA rated range of 76 mi (122 km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy of 105 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.2 L/100 km).[217] Available also in Canada and several European countries, 3,965 units have been sold in the U.S. through September 2014.[196][197][198][218]\n\n\nThe Ford C-Max Energi is a plug-in hybrid released in the U.S. in October 2012. The C-Max Energi has an EPA rated all-electric range of 20 mi (32 km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode at 88 MPG-e (2.7 L/100 km).[219] U.S. sales totaled 33,509 units through December 2016.[196][197][220][221][222] Deliveries of the Ford Fusion Energi began in the United States in February 2013.[223][224] The Fusion Energi has an all-electric range of 20 mi (32 km) and an equivalent fuel economy EPA rating of 88 MPG-e (2.7 L/100 km).[219] As of December 2016[update], a total of 43,327 units have been delivered in the U.S. since its inception.[197][220][221][222]\n\n\nBoth Energi models share the same powertrain technology and have the same EPA combined city/highway fuel economy in hybrid operation of 38 mpg‑US (6.2 L/100 km; 46 mpg‑imp).[219]\nWhen asked about a battery-electric vehicle with a 200-mile (320 km) range, Fields said in April 2016 \"Clearly that's something we're developing for\". Ford has a pending trademark application on the \"Model E\" name,[225] preventing the Tesla Model 3 in using the name.[226]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Ford announced its Team Edison battery-electric vehicle group to lead the company's renewed efforts into the EV market, in which it currently offers only the Focus subcompact and has plans for a small 300-mile SUV by 2020.[227] The new team will be headquartered in Detroit and have offices in Europe and Asia.[228]\n\n\nIn 2022, Ford began manufacturing its E-Transit electric cargo vans at its plant in Kansas City, Missouri.[229]\n\n\n\n![a photograph showing the front-left quarter of a grey automobile](image)Ford Mustang Mach-E\n### Hydrogen[edit]\n\n\nFord also continues to study fuel cell-powered electric powertrains and has demonstrated hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. Compared with conventional vehicles, hybrid vehicles and/or fuel cell vehicles decrease air pollution emissions as well as sound levels, with favorable impacts upon respiratory health and decrease of noise health effects.\n\n\nFord has launched the production of hydrogen-powered shuttle buses, using hydrogen instead of gasoline in a standard internal combustion engine, for use at airports and convention centers.[230] At the 2006 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, Ford showcased a hydrogen fuel cell version of its Explorer SUV. The Fuel cell Explorer has a combined output of 174 hp (130 kW). It has a large hydrogen storage tank which is situated in the center of the car taking the original place of the conventional model's automatic transmission. The centered position of the tank assists the vehicle reach a notable range of 350 miles (563 km), the farthest for a fuel cell vehicle so far. The fuel cell Explorer the first in a series of prototypes partly funded by the United States Department of Energy to expand efforts to determine the feasibility of hydrogen-powered vehicles. The fuel cell Explorer is one of several vehicles with green technology being featured at the L.A. show, including the 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid, PZEV emissions compliant Fusion and Focus models and a 2008 Ford F-Series Super Duty outfitted with Ford's clean diesel technology.\n\n\n\n### Increased fuel efficiency[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Ford Motor Company announced that it would accelerate its plans to produce more fuel-efficient cars, changing both its North American manufacturing plans and its lineup of vehicles available in the United States. In terms of North American manufacturing, the company planned to convert three existing truck and sport utility vehicle (SUV) plants for small car production, with the first conversion at its Michigan Truck Plant. In addition, Ford's assembly plants near Mexico City, Mexico, and in Louisville, Kentucky, were to be converted from pickups and SUVs to small cars, including the Ford Fiesta, by 2011. Ford then also planned to introduce to North America six of its European small vehicles, including two versions of the Ford Fiesta, by the end of 2012.[231]\n\n\nFord of Europe developed the ECOnetic programme to address the market and legislative need for higher fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions. As opposed to the hybrid engine technology used in competitor products such as the Toyota Prius, ECOnetic improves existing technology. Using lower-consuming Duratorq TDCi diesel engines, and based on a combination of improved aerodynamics, lower resistance, and improved efficiency, the Ford Fiesta was the lowest-emitting mass-produced car in Europe[232] while the 2012 Ford Focus ECOnetic will have better fuel consumption than the Prius or the Volkswagen Golf BlueMotion.[233] ECOnetic is not presently planned to be sold in North American due to current perceived lower consumer demand.[234]\n\n\nFord has challenged University teams to create a vehicle that is simple, durable, lightweight, and comes equipped with a base target price of only $7,000. The students from Aachen University created the \"2015 Ford Model T\".[235][236]\n\n\nIn 2000, under the leadership of the current Ford chairman, William Clay Ford, the company announced[237] a planned 25 percent improvement in the average mileage of its SUVs—to be completed by the 2005 calendar year. In 2003, Ford announced that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent the company from achieving this goal.[238]\n\n\nFor the 2007 model year, Ford had thirteen U.S. models that achieve 30 miles per gallon or better (based on the highway fuel economy estimates of the EPA) and several of Ford's vehicles were recognized in the EPA and Department of Energy Fuel Economy Guide for best-in-class fuel economy. Ford claimed to have eliminated nearly three million pounds of smog-forming emissions from their U.S. cars and light trucks over the 2004 to 2006 model years.[239] However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has linked Ford to 54 Superfund toxic waste sites, twelve of which have been cleaned up and deleted from the list.[240]\n\n\n\n### Efficient buildings[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a renovation of the Ford River Rouge Complex, in 2010 Ford unveiled a 10.4-acre (42,000 m2) living roof covering part of the Dearborn Truck plant, consisting of sedum, a low-growing groundcover. The sedum retains and cleanses rainwater and moderates the internal temperature of the building, saving energy.[241]\n\n\nIn 2016, Ford announced a ten-year renovation plan for its Dearborn campus.[242] The plan features consolidation of office and lab spaces in to fewer and much larger buildings, which will be built to LEED standards, and will feature extensive use of wetlands and park spaces.[243][244] The new campus features new multi-story parking decks with solar power-generating roofs,[245] and a new natural gas power plant. The DTE Ford Central Energy Plant is a 34MW combined heat-and-power plant which features a high efficiency design and LEED Gold buildings.[246]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nFord sponsors numerous events and sports facilities around the U.S., most notably the Ford Center in downtown Evansville, Indiana, and Ford Field in downtown Detroit.[247]\n\n\nThe company has also been a major sponsor of the UEFA Champions League for over two decades, and is also a longtime sponsor of the Sky media channel's coverage of Premier League football.\n\n\nBetween 1994 and 1999, Ford was the main kit sponsor of German Bundesliga club 1. FC Köln.\n\n\n\n## Sales numbers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Calendar Year\n | US sales\n | Market share\nof US sales[248]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997\n | 3,877,458[249] | 25.0%\n |\n| 1998\n | 3,922,604[250] | 24.5%\n |\n| 1999\n | 4,163,369[251] | 23.9%\n |\n| 2000\n | 4,202,820\n | 23.6%\n |\n| 2001\n | 3,971,364\n | 22.7%\n |\n| 2002\n | 3,623,709[252] | 21.2%\n |\n| 2003\n | 3,483,719\n | 20.5%\n |\n| 2004\n | 3,331,676[253] | 19.3%\n |\n| 2005\n | 3,153,875\n | 18.1%\n |\n| 2006\n | 2,901,090[254] | 17.0%\n |\n| 2007\n | 2,507,366\n | 15.2%\n |\n| 2008\n | 1,988,376[255] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2009\n | 1,620,888[256] | 15.3%\n |\n| 2010\n | 1,935,462[257] | 16.4%\n |\n| 2011\n | 2,143,101[258] | 16.4%\n |\n| 2012\n | 2,250,165[259] | 15.2%\n |\n| 2013\n | 2,493,918[260] | 15.7%\n |\n| 2014\n | 2,480,942[261] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2015\n | 2,613,162[262] | 14.6%\n |\n| 2016\n | 2,614,697[263][264] | 14.6%\n |\n| 2017\n | 2,586,715[265] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,497,318[265] | 14.1%\n |\n| 2019\n | 2,422,698[266] | 13.8%\n |\n| 2020\n | 2,044,744[267] | 13.7%\n |\n| 2021\n | 1,905,955[268] | 12.4%\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cars portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![flag](image)Michigan portal\n\n\n* Ford's Garage\n* Bridj\n* Chariot (company)\n* Detroit Automobile Company\n* Dodge v.

It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and luxury cars under its Lincoln brand. Ford also owns a 32% stake in China's Jiangling Motors.[8] It also has joint ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), and Turkey (Ford Otosan). The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.[6][9]\n\n\nFord introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000, respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010.[10] In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.\n\n\nFord is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) and the sixth-largest in the world (behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, Stellantis, and General Motors) based on 2022 vehicle production.[11] At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth-largest automaker in Europe.[12] The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent of the voting rights.[6][13] During the financial crisis of 2007–08, the company struggled financially but did not have to be rescued by the federal government, unlike the other two major US automakers.[14][15] Ford Motors has since returned to profitability,[16] and was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion.[17] In 2008, Ford produced 5.532 million automobiles[18] and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ford Motor Company\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founder Henry Ford c. 1919\nThe Henry Ford Company was Henry Ford's first attempt at a car manufacturing company and was established on November 3, 1901. This became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name.[19] The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 (equivalent to $950,000 in 2023) in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). The first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen in order to assuage investors' fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later at its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade the company led the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house (vertical integration).\n\n\nHenry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. It has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first gasoline-powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz (Benz Patent-Motorwagen). More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for the middle class, to which Ford contributed by, for instance, introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at the Ford factory in Highland Park.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A 1910 Model T (introduced in 1908), photographed in Salt Lake City\nBetween 1903 and 1908, Ford produced the Models A, B, C, F, K, N, R, and S. Hundreds or a few thousand of most of these were sold per year. In 1908, Ford introduced the mass-produced Model T, which totaled millions sold over nearly 20 years. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the Model A, the first car with safety glass in the windshield.[20] Ford launched the first low-priced car with a V8 engine in 1932.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn an attempt to compete with General Motors' mid-priced Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick, Ford created the Mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to Ford. Henry Ford purchased the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922, in order to compete with such brands as Cadillac and Packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1929, Ford was contracted by the government of the Soviet Union to set up the Gorky Automobile Plant in Russia initially producing Ford Model A and AAs thereby playing an important role in the industrialization of that country.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)B-24 Liberator bombers being mass-produced at Ford's Willow Run assembly plant in 1944\nDuring World War II, the United States Department of War picked Ford to mass-produce the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber at its Willow Run assembly plant.[22] Ford Werke and Ford SAF (Ford's subsidiaries in Germany and France, respectively) produced military vehicles and other equipment for Nazi Germany's war effort. Some of Ford's operations in Germany at the time were run using forced labor.\n\n\nThe creation of a scientific laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan, in 1951, doing unfettered basic research, led to Ford's unlikely involvement in superconductivity research. In 1964, Ford Research Labs made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or SQUID.[23]\n\n\nFord offered the Lifeguard safety package from 1956, which included such innovations as a standard deep-dish steering wheel, optional front, and, for the first time in a car, rear seatbelts, and an optional padded dash.[24] Ford introduced child-proof door locks into its products in 1957, and, in the same year, offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car.[25]\n\n\nIn late 1955, Ford established the Continental division as a separate luxury car division. This division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous Continental Mark II. At the same time, the Edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year. Due to limited sales of the Continental and the Edsel disaster, Ford merged Mercury, Edsel, and Lincoln into \"M-E-L,\" which reverted to \"Lincoln-Mercury\" after Edsel's November 1959 demise.[25]\n\n\nThe Ford Mustang was introduced on April 17, 1964, during New York World's Fair (where Ford had a pavilion made by The Walt Disney Company).[26][27] In 1965, Ford introduced the seat belt reminder light.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the 1980s, Ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world. During the 1980s, Ford began using the advertising slogan, \"Have you driven a Ford, lately?\" to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern. In 1990 and 1994, respectively, Ford also acquired Jaguar Cars and Aston Martin.[28] During the mid-to-late 1990s, Ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles, in a booming American economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the dawn of the new century, legacy health care costs, higher fuel prices, and a faltering economy led to falling market shares, declining sales, and diminished profit margins. Most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through Ford Motor Credit Company.[29]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford, serves as the executive chairman at the board of Ford Motor Company.\nBy 2005, both Ford and GM's corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status[30] as a result of high U.S. health care costs for an aging workforce, soaring gasoline prices, eroding market share, and an overdependence on declining SUV sales. Profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased \"incentives\" (in the form of rebates or low-interest financing) to offset declining demand.[31] In the latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly appointed Ford Americas Division President Mark Fields to develop a plan to return the company to profitability. Fields previewed the plan, named *The Way Forward*, at the board meeting of the company on December 7, 2005, and it was unveiled to the public on January 23, 2006. \"The Way Forward\" included resizing the company to match market realities, dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models, consolidating production lines, closing 14 factories and cutting 30,000 jobs.[32]\n\n\nFord moved to introduce a range of new vehicles, including \"Crossover SUVs\" built on unibody car platforms, rather than more body-on-frame chassis. In developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the Ford Escape Hybrid SUV, the company licensed similar Toyota hybrid technologies[33] in order to avoid patent infringements.[34] Ford announced that it would team up with electricity supply company Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine the future of plug-in hybrids in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford is to convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE is to evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles are to be evaluated \"in typical customer settings\", according to Ford.[35][36]\n\n\nWilliam Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford (and better known by his nickname \"Bill\"), was appointed executive chairman in 1998, and also became chief executive officer of the company in 2001, with the departure of Jacques Nasser, becoming the first member of the Ford family to head the company since the retirement of his uncle, Henry Ford II, in 1982. Ford sold motorsport engineering company Cosworth to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven in 2004, the start of a decrease in Ford's motorsport involvement. Upon the retirement of president and chief operations officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed his roles as well. Five months later, in September, Ford named Alan Mulally as president and CEO, with Ford continuing as executive chairman. In December 2006, the company raised its borrowing capacity to about $25 billion, placing substantially all corporate assets as collateral.[37] Chairman Bill Ford has stated that \"bankruptcy is not an option\".[38] Ford and the United Auto Workers, representing approximately 46,000 hourly workers in North America, agreed to a historic contract settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues. The agreement included the establishment of a company-funded, independently run Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the company's books, thereby improving its balance sheet. This arrangement took effect on January 1, 2010. As a sign of its currently strong cash position, Ford contributed its entire current liability (estimated at US$5.5 billion as of December 31, 2009) to the VEBA in cash, and also pre-paid US$500 million of its future liabilities to the fund. The agreement also gave hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories.\n\n\n\n![](image)Horton Classic Car Museum, Nocona, Texas.\nThe automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of $12.7 billion,[39] and estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009.[40] However, Ford surprised Wall Street in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a $750 million profit. Despite the gains, the company finished the year with a $2.7 billion loss, largely attributed to finance restructuring at Volvo.[41]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2008, Ford sold its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors for $2.3 billion.[42][43]\n\n\nDuring congressional hearings held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., Ford's Alan Mulally stated that \"We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity. But we also must prepare ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions\". He went on to state that \"The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford\" and that Ford Motor Company supported both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis.[44][45] Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that \"In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company\".[46] GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through T.A.R.P. legislation funding provisions.[47]\n\n\nOn December 19, the cost of credit default swaps to insure the debt of Ford was 68 percent of the sum insured for five years, in addition to annual payments of 5 percent. That meant $6.8 million paid upfront to insure $10 million in debt, in addition to payments of $500,000 per year.[48] In January 2009, Ford reported a $14.6 billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt-for-equity exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position.[49] These actions yielded Ford a $2.7 billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's first full-year profit in four years.[50] In 2012, Ford's corporate bonds were upgraded from junk to investment grade again, citing sustainable, lasting improvements.[51]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Ford announced the sale of its climate control components business, its last remaining automotive components operation, to Detroit Thermal Systems LLC for an undisclosed price.[52]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2012, Ford announced that CEO Alan Mulally would stay with the company until 2014. Ford also named Mark Fields, its president of operations in the Americas, as its new chief operating officer[53] Mulally was paid a compensation of over $174 million in his previous seven years at Ford since 2006. The generous amount has been a sore point for some workers of the company.[54]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Ford announced a plan to modernize its Dearborn engineering and headquarters campuses through a ten-year building project. The result would see the number of Ford employees working in these areas doubling, to 24,000. During construction, some 2000 of the employees were relocated out of the campus to a temporary location in a disused section of the local shopping mall.[55] Facilities would also be altered to allow ride-sharing and electric and self-driving vehicles.[56] Estimates of the construction cost were $1.2 billion.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)The historic, once abandoned Michigan Central Station was purchased by Ford Motor Company in May 2018 and is expected to undergo a significant four-year renovation.\nOn January 3, 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that in a \"vote of confidence\" because of the pro-business climate being fostered in part by President-elect Donald Trump, Ford had canceled plans to invest $1.6 billion in a new plant in Mexico to manufacture the Ford Focus; instead, the company would invest $700 million in Michigan, which it planned to use to create 700 new jobs. The Focus would now be manufactured in the existing plant in Mexico.[58] Also in 2017, Ford began development of a new mixed-use urban campus in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit, with its purchase, renovation, and occupation of The Factory at Michigan and Rosa Parks. The new site was expected to have a major focus on the development of autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle technology.[59] Ford later began buying up other parcels of land in Corktown including a very high-profile purchase of Michigan Central Station which is planned to become the hub of their Corktown campus, and the adjacent Roosevelt Warehouse.[60] Ford expects to move 2,500 of its employees, roughly 5 percent of its southeast Michigan workforce, to the campus with space for an additional 2,500 entrepreneurs, technology companies and partners.[61] Bill Ford envisioned the first-floor concourse of the train station to be a public gathering place with retail outlets and restaurants.[62]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Ford Motor Co. acquired majority ownership of Argo AI, a self-driving car startup.[63]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Ford announced cuts to its global workforce amid efforts to address the company's declining share price and to improve profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a nearly 10% reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America to enhance earnings in 2018.[64][65] Jim Hackett was announced to replace Mark Fields as CEO of Ford Motor. Mr. Hackett most recently oversaw the formation of Ford Smart Mobility, a unit responsible for experimenting with car-sharing programs, self-driving ventures and other programs aimed at helping Ford better compete with Uber, Alphabet Inc. and other tech giants looking to edge in on the auto industry.[66][67]\n\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it would discontinue passenger cars in the North American market in the next four years, except for the Mustang, due to declining demand and profitability.[68] The Focus Active, a crossover SUV based on the newly unveiled fourth-generation Focus, was also intended to be marketed in the United States. Due to the vehicle being manufactured in China, Ford later announced that it would not release the Focus Active in the United States, due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese exports.[69][70]\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Detroit United Auto Workers union announced that after discussion with the leaders of General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the carmakers would partially shut down factories on a \"rotating\" basis to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.[71] On March 24, representatives of Ford announced that production in the US, Canada, and Mexico would not resume on March 30 as originally planned, amid the further coronavirus pandemic spread.[72] In the first quarter of 2020, Ford's sales dropped by 15%, entailing the loss of $2 billion.[73]\n\n\nWith the change in the demand for the sport vehicles, on January 6, 2021, Ford reported a sales fall of 9.8% in the fourth quarter, selling 542,749 vehicles, compared to 601,862 in 2019.[74]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Ford said that it would provide COVID-19 vaccines for its employees, who were to obtain them at the company; at the beginning the vaccination program would be in southeast Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, but it was to be expanded later on to other locations.[75]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Ford announced that it would restructure the company into three separate divisions. Ford Model E is to focus on electric vehicles; Ford Blue is to focus on internal combustion vehicles; and the existing commercial division is to be rebranded as Ford Pro, to focus on vehicle distribution and service.[76][7]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Ford announced it planned layoffs of roughly 3,000 employees and contract workers, confirming earlier reporting. The cuts would mostly affect divisions in the US, Canada, and India, which Jim Farley said would allow the company to prepare for the future of electric, software-heavy vehicles.[77][78]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Ford announced that it was going to cut 3,800 jobs across Europe, with the job cuts mainly focusing on their German and British workforce. Ford will be cutting 2,300 jobs from Germany, 1,300 from the United Kingdom, and an additional 200 jobs in the rest of Europe, according to the head of Ford Germany, Martin Sander. The cuts will mainly be done to the company's engineers.[79]\n\n\nFord announced that their electric vehicle business had lost $3 billion before taxes over the past two years and will lose a similar amount in 2023 as the company looks to significantly invest in Electric Technology. The Ford Model E is expected to be profitable by 2026.[80]\n\n\nIn April 2023, United Kingdom ministers approved Ford's BlueCruise technology. Because of this assisted driving technology, Ford drivers can now legally take their hands off the wheel on certain roads. Its top speed is 129 km/h (80 mph). BlueCruise uses sensors and cameras to regulate the car's speed and to keep track of speed limits and road signs. It also monitors and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles. It also comes equipped with an eye-tracking system. If the driver stops looking at the road then the car will gradually reduce its speed. This technology will initially be offered in Ford's 2023 model of the electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. \nAccording to Thatcham Research, an automotive research company, this model is not a self-driving car. It is classified as a level 2 or partial automation assistance system. This means that technology controls two or more driving aspects but still requires human driver control in cases of emergencies. The driver is still legally responsible for accidents.[81]\n\n\n\n### Logo evolution[edit]\n\n\n* ![1903](image)\n\n1903\n* ![1907](image)\n\n1907\n* ![1909](image)\n\n1909\n* ![1911](image)\n\n1911\n* ![1912](image)\n\n1912\n* ![1912 variant](image)\n\n1912 variant\n* ![1927](image)\n\n1927\n* ![1957](image)\n\n1957\n* ![1976](image)\n\n1976\n* ![2003](image)\n\n2003\n* ![2017](image)\n\n2017\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Executive management[edit]\n\n\nMembers of the Ford board as of March 2023[update] are: William Clay Ford Jr. (executive chairman), Jim Farley (president and CEO), Kimberly Casiano, Alexandra Ford English (daughter of William Clay Ford Jr.), Henry Ford III (son of Edsel Ford II), William W. Helman IV, Jon Huntsman Jr., William E. Kennard, John C. May, Beth E. Mooney, John L. Thornton, John Veihmeyer, Lynn Vojvodich Radakovich, and John S. Weinberg.[82]\n\n\nJim Farley succeeded Jim Hackett as the chief executive officer of the company in August, 2020; he previously served as Ford's chief operating officer. Hackett stayed in the company as an advisor until the second quarter of 2021.[83]\n\n\n\n## Ford Motor Company Fund[edit]\n\n\nThe Ford Motor Company Fund (also known as Ford Fund, not affiliated with the Ford Foundation), based in Dearborn, Michigan, is the philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company.[84] Established in 1949[85] by Henry Ford II,[*citation needed*] Ford Fund is a nonprofit corporate foundation[86] financed by contributions from Ford Motor Company. In 2017, Ford Fund contributed $63 million[87] to various causes[84] with a focus on education, driving safely and community building.\n\n\nThe Ford Driving Skills for Life program is a driver safety program aimed at teens that were developed together with the Governors Highway Safety Association and safety experts.[88] The Ford Volunteer Corps allows Ford employees and retirees to sign up for volunteering work on local projects in more than 40 countries.[89] The Ford Fund invests $18 million annually in education in the United States and around the world, but accepts applications only from nonprofit organizations registered in the U.S.[90] Education programs and scholarships include Alan Mulally Engineering Scholarship, Ford Blue Oval Scholars Program, Ford College Community Challenge (Ford C3), Ford Driving Dreams Tour, Ford Fund/Detroit Free Press Journalism Scholarship, Ford Next Generation Learning (Ford NGL), Grants to Individuals Program, HBCU Community Challenge, Smithsonian Latino Center Young Ambassadors Program, and William Clay Ford Automotive Design Scholarship.\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nFord has had manufacturing operations worldwide, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa. Ford also helped the Soviet Union to construct Russian automaker GAZ.\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford dealer in Garden City, New York, c. 1930–1945\nIn May 2010, Ford reported that its sales increased 23% for the month, and that 37% of its sales came from fleet sales.[91] In June 2010, sales to individual customers at dealerships increased 13% while fleet sales rose by 32%.[92] In the first seven months of 2010, fleet sales of Ford for the same period rose 35% to 386,000 units while retail sales increase 19%.[93] Fleet sales account for 39 percent of Chrysler's sales and 31 percent for GM's.[93]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford of Europe\n\n![](image)The Ford Research Center in Aachen, Germany, photographed in 2006\nAt first, Ford in Germany and Ford in Britain built different models from one another until 1965, when the Ford Transit and later the Ford Escort and the Ford Capri became common to both companies. In 1970, the Ford Taunus and the Ford Cortina came into production with a common base construction, both models being produced in left hand drive and right hand drive. Later on, the models became identical and the respective models right- and left-hand-drive exclusively. Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including Belgium and Spain as well as Germany. The Ford Sierra replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames, the \"Jellymould\" and \"The Salesman's Spaceship.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Ford's Dunton Technical Centre in Laindon, United Kingdom, the largest automotive research and development facility in the country,[94] pictured in 2006\nIn February 2002, Ford ended car production in the UK. It was the first time in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the Transit van continued at the company's Southampton facility until mid-2013, engines at Bridgend and Dagenham, and transmissions at Halewood. Development of European Ford is broadly split between Dunton in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka, and commercial vehicles) and Cologne (body, chassis, electrical, Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the Thames range of commercial vehicles, although the use of this brand name was discontinued with the introduction of the Ford Transit in 1965. Elsewhere in continental Europe, Ford assembles the Mondeo, Galaxy, S-Max[95] and Kuga[96] in Valencia (Spain), Fiesta in Cologne (Germany), Focus in Saarlouis (Germany), Ecosport[97] and Puma[98] in Craiova (Romania).\n\n\nFord also owns a joint-venture production plant in Turkey. Ford Otosan, established in the 1970s, manufactures the Transit Connect compact panel van as well as the \"Jumbo\" and long-wheelbase versions of the full-size Transit. This new production facility was set up near Kocaeli in 2002, and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk.\n\n\nAnother joint venture plant near Setúbal in Portugal, set up in collaboration with Volkswagen, formerly assembled the Galaxy people-carrier as well as its sister ships, the VW Sharan and SEAT Alhambra. With the introduction of the third generation of the Galaxy, Ford has moved the production of the people-carrier to the Genk plant, with Volkswagen taking over sole ownership of the Setúbal facility.\n\n\nIn 2008, Ford acquired a majority stake in Automobile Craiova, Romania. Starting 2009, the Ford Transit Connect was Ford's first model produced in Craiova, followed, in 2012, by low-capacity car engines and a new small class car, the B-Max.[99]\n\n\nIts 1959 Anglia two-door saloon was one of the most quirky-looking small family cars in Europe at the time of its launch, but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with British buyers in particular. It was still selling well when replaced by the more practical Escort in 1967.\n\n\nThe third incarnation of the Ford Escort was launched in 1980 and marked the company's move from rear-wheel-drive saloons to front-wheel-drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector.\n\n\nThe fourth-generation Escort was produced from 1990 until 2000, although its successor—the Focus—had been on sale since 1998. On its launch, the Focus was arguably the most dramatic-looking and fine-handling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next-generation Focus at the end of 2004.\n\n\nThe 1982 Ford Sierra—replacement for the long-running and massively popular Cortina and Taunus models—was a style-setter at the time of its launch. Its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy, sharp-edged Cortina, and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold. A series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel-drive Mondeo at the start of 1993.\n\n\nThe rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw Ford enter the mini-car market in 1976 with its Fiesta hatchback. Most of its production was concentrated at Valencia in Spain, and the Fiesta sold in huge figures from the very start. An update in 1983 and the launch of an all-new model in 1989 strengthened its position in the small car market.\n\n\nOn October 24, 2012, Ford announced that it would close its Genk assembly plant in eastern Belgium by the end of 2014.[100]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ford announced that it took control of Ford Sollers, Ford's joint venture with Russian company Sollers.[101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2018, at the IAA Commercial Vehicles show in Hannover, Germany, Ford introduced an electric tractor-trailer concept vehicle dubbed the F-Vision, which would have Level 4 autonomous driving capability.[103]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Ford announced that it was suspending its Sollers joint venture operation in Russia, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[104][105] On October 26, 2022, Ford sold its 49 percent share in the joint venture, and exited the Russian market,[106] adding that it retains the option to buy them back within a 5-year period “should the global situation change.[107]\n\n\n\n### East and Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord formed its first passenger-vehicle joint venture in China in 2001, six years behind GM and more than a decade after VW. It has spent as of 2013[update] $4.9 billion to expand its lineup and double production capacity in China to 600,000 vehicles. This includes Ford's largest-ever factory complex in the southwestern city of Chongqing. Ford had 2.5% of the Chinese market in 2013, while VW controlled 14.5% and GM had 15.6%, according to consultant LMC Automotive. GM outsells Ford in China by more than six-to-one.[108] Ford's presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller, confined to Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan, where Ford has had a joint venture with Lio Ho since the 1970s. Ford began assembly of cars in Thailand in 1960, but withdrew from the country in 1976, and did not return until 1995 when it formed a joint venture with Mazda called Auto Alliance.[109] Now based in the Bo-win Sub District of the Sriracha District in Chonburi, the factory still produces passenger automobiles. The factory, built in 1941 in Singapore, was soon taken over by the Japanese during the war and was the site of a surrender of the British to the Japanese, at the factory site which is now a national monument in Singapore.\nOn April 30, 2013, Ford Motor Co. launched their car and truck line in Myanmar. Previously, heavy importation taxes had stifled imported car purchases in Myanmar, but due to currency reform, lifting of previous import restrictions, and the abolishment of shadow currency, Myanmar's car market had grown in demand.[110]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea[edit]\n\n\nIn 1967, Ford partnered with the South Korean company Hyundai, and at the new factory in Ulsan, South Korea, built the European Ford Cortina until 1974 when Hyundai introduced their all-new Hyundai Pony in 1975. Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer Kia which built vehicles co-engineered with Mazda, later selling the Ford Festiva from 1988 to 1993, and the Ford Aspire from 1994 to 1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer Mazda in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's Familia and Capella as the Ford Laser and Telstar throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. From 1989 to 1996, Kia imported the Mercury Sable from Ford in the U.S. and sold them in South Korea as the Kia Sable. Though the Sable was branded and marketed as a Kia, it retained the Mercury badges and emblem. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; in 1998, Hyundai Motor Company acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986.[111] After subsequent divestments,[112] Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], Ford sells the Explorer, Mondeo, and Mustang,[113] as well as the Lincoln Aviator, Continental, Corsair, MKZ, and Nautilus in South Korea.[114]\n\n\n\n### South and West Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord India began production in 1998 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, with its Ford Escort model, which was later replaced by the locally produced Ford Ikon in 2001. It has since added the Fusion, Fiesta, Mondeo and Endeavour models to its product line.\n\n\nOn March 9, 2010, Ford launched its first made-for-India compact car. Starting at ₹349,900, the Figo was Ford's first car designed and priced for the mass Indian market.[115] On July 28, 2011, Ford India signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the State of Gujarat for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in Sanand and planned to invest approximately US$1 billion on a 460-acre site.[116] In 2019, the company and Mahindra & Mahindra formed a joint venture to develop, market and distribute Ford-branded vehicles in India.[117] In September 2021 Ford India announced plans to shut down both its assembly plants. The company said that it intends to maintain its parts and service network.[118]\n\n\nFord's market presence in the Middle East has traditionally been small, partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region.[119] Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest markets. Ford also established itself in Egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment.[120] Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were Ford Crown Victorias.[121] In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of General Motors' 88,852 units and Nissan Motors' 75,000 units.\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford assembly plant in General Pacheco, Argentina, as seen in the 1960s\nIn South America, Ford's primary operations are in Brazil, Argentina, and Ford Andina[122] (Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela). Ford employs over 18,000 people and operates seven assembly or other plants in the region.[123] In 1987, Ford Brasil and Ford Motor Argentina merged their operations with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group, forming a new joint-venture company called Autolatina with a shared model range.[124] Autolatina was dissolved in 1995.[124]\n\n\nIn early 2021, Ford's Brazil branch announced it would completely cease production in the country over the course of a few months.[125]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn Africa, Ford's market presence has traditionally been strongest in South Africa and neighbouring countries, with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent. Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its facility in Port Elizabeth; the company later sourced its models from the UK and Australia, with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6, with a 3.0 V6 engine, and a Cortina-based 'bakkie' or pick-up, which was exported to the UK. In the mid-1980s Ford merged with a rival company, owned by Anglo American, to form the South African Motor Corporation (Samcor).[126]\n\n\nFollowing international condemnation of apartheid, Ford divested from South Africa in 1988, and sold its stake in Samcor, although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company.[127] Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well, which affected its product line-up and saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the Mazda-based Laser[128] and Telstar.[129] Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in Samcor following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and this later became, once again, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta (also built in India and Mexico), and the Focus. The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa, but was dropped in 2003; the Mondeo, after briefly being assembled locally, was dropped in 2005. The Mondeo was later reintroduced in 2015, badged as the Fusion, but was dropped in 2017.[130]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nFord Research and Innovation Center is the name of the technology research facilities of Ford Motor Company in\n\n\n\n* Dearborn, Michigan\n* Palo Alto, California\n* Aachen, Germany\n* Nanjing, China\n\n\nThe Ford Research and Innovation Center in Palo Alto was first opened in 2012, and in January 2015, announced plans to significantly expand its operations.[131][132][133][134]\n\n\n\n## Former operations[edit]\n\n\n### East and Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord decided to shut down their entire operations in Indonesia, including their dealer network by second half of 2016.[135][136]\n\n\n\n#### Ford of Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Motor Company of Japan\n\nFord established a manufacturing facility in the port city of Yokohama in February 1925, where Model T vehicles were assembled using imported knock-down kits.[137] The factory subsequently produced 10,000 Model A's up to 1936. Production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between Japan and the United States.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Ford did not have a presence in Japan, as the Ford facility was appropriated by the Japanese Government until 1958 when property was returned as a possession of the Ford Motor Company and became a research and development location for Ford partner Mazda. In 1979, Ford acquired a 24.5% ownership stake in Mazda, and in 1982, Ford and Mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell Ford products in Japan, including vehicles manufactured in North America, at a dealership called *Autorama (Japanese)*. The Autorama sales channel was renamed Ford Sales of Japan in 1997.[138]\n\n\nVehicles sold at *Autorama* locations were the North American assembled Ford Explorer, Probe (1989–1998), Mustang, Taurus (1989–1997), Thunderbird (1990–1993), Lincoln Continental, and Lincoln LS. Ford products manufactured in Europe that were sold in Japan were the Ford Mondeo, Ka, Focus, Focus C-MAX, Fiesta, and the Galaxy. Mazda manufactured Ford vehicles in Japan and sold them as Fords at the Autorama locations. They were the Ford Telstar (Mazda Capella), Laser, Festiva, Festiva Mini Wagon, Ixion (Mazda Premacy), Freda (Mazda Bongo Friendee), Spectron (Mazda Bongo), and commercial trucks J80 and the J100 (Mazda Bongo truck).\n\n\nFord increased its shareholding in Mazda to 33.4% in 1996, but as of July 2016[update], it is listed at 11%.[139] Ford did sell a small range of vehicles in Japan; as of October 2010[update], the Ford Mustang, Escape, Explorer (and Explorer truck), Ford Kuga, Lincoln Navigator, Lincoln MKX, and more recently, the Ford Ecosport were available in Japan. As of February 2016[update], Ford no longer maintains a regional office in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, and sales of new cars in Japan have ended.[140][141]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford FG X Falcon (Australia) (2014–2016; 2014 model shown)\n![](image)The Ford stamping plant in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. It closed in 2016.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the popular Ford Falcon (1960–2016) had long been considered the average family car and is considerably larger than the Mondeo, Ford's largest car sold in Europe. Between 1960 and 1972, the Falcon was based on a U.S. model of the same name, but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured in Australia until 2016, occasionally being manufactured in New Zealand. Like its General Motors rival, the Holden Commodore, the Falcon used a rear-wheel-drive layout. High-performance variants of the Falcon running locally built engines produce up to 362 hp (270 kW). A ute (short for \"utility\", known in the U.S. as pickup truck) version is also available with the same range of drivetrains. In addition, Ford Australia sold highly tuned limited-production Falcon sedans and utes through its performance car division, Ford Performance Vehicles until it closed in 2014.\n\n\nIn Australia, the Commodore and Falcon had traditionally outsold all other cars and constituted over 20% of the new car market. In New Zealand, Ford was second in market share in the first eight months of 2006 with 14.4%.[142] More recently, Ford has axed its Falcon-based LWB variant of its lineup– the Fairlane and LTD ranges. Ford discontinued the Fairlane in 2007 and LTD in 2008. Ford had announced that their Geelong engine manufacturing plant would be shut down between 2013 and 2016. They had earlier announced local manufacturing of the Focus small car starting from 2011, but instead decided to import the model from Ford's plant in Thailand.[143]\n\n\nIn Australia, the Laser was one of Ford Australia's most successful models and was manufactured in Ford's Homebush West plant from 1981 until the plant's closure in September 1994. It outsold the Mazda 323, despite being almost identical to it because the Laser was manufactured in Australia and Ford was perceived as a local brand.[144] According to research carried out by Ford Australia in 1984, a third of Laser buyers were unaware that the Ford model was based on the Mazda 323.[145]\n\n\nIn New Zealand, the Ford Laser and Telstar were assembled alongside the Mazda 323 and 626 until 1997, at the Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in Wiri, Auckland.[146] The Sierra wagon was also assembled in New Zealand, owing to the popularity of station wagons in that market.[147]\n\n\nThe scheduled closure of Ford's Australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed on May 23, 2013. Headquartered in the Victorian suburb of Broadmeadows, the company had registered losses worth AU$600 million over the five years prior to the announcement. It was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that account for two-thirds of large, local car sales in Australia are insufficient to keep Ford's products profitable and viable in Australia. The decision will affect 1200 Ford workers—over 600 employees in Geelong and more than 500 in Broadmeadows—who will lose their jobs by October 2016. The closure of Ford's plants in Norlane Geelong and Broadmeadows Melbourne occurred on October 7, 2016.[148]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n### Automobiles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Ford vehicles, List of Lincoln vehicles, and List of Mercury vehicles\n\n![](image)The 2017 model year F-150\nFord Motor Company sells a broad range of automobiles under the Ford marque worldwide, and an additional range of luxury automobiles under the Lincoln marque in the United States. The company has sold vehicles under a number of other marques during its history. The Mercury brand was introduced by Ford in 1939, continuing in production until 2011 when poor sales led to its discontinuation.[149] In 1958, Ford introduced the Edsel brand, but poor sales led to its discontinuation in 1960. In 1985, the Merkur brand was introduced in the United States to market products produced by Ford of Europe; it was discontinued in 1989.\n\n\nFord acquired the British sports car maker Aston Martin in 1989, later selling it on March 12, 2007,[150] although retaining an 8% stake.[151][152] Ford purchased Volvo Cars of Sweden in 1999,[153] selling it to Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in 2010.\n\n\nIn November 2008, it reduced its 33.4% controlling interest in Mazda of Japan to a 13.4% non-controlling interest.[154] On November 18, 2010, Ford reduced their stake further to just 3%, citing the reduction of ownership would allow greater flexibility to pursue growth in emerging markets. Ford and Mazda remain strategic partners through exchanges of technological information and joint ventures, including an American joint venture plant in Flat Rock, Michigan called Auto Alliance.[155] In 2015, Ford sold its remaining 3% stake in Mazda.[156]\n\n\nFord sold the United Kingdom-based Jaguar and Land Rover companies and brands to Tata Motors of India in March 2008.\n\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it planned to phase out all but one of its North American automobile models (the Mustang will be the sole surviving model) to focus primarily on trucks and SUVs. Ford had also planned to introduce an \"Active\" crossover version of the next-generation Focus, but canceled those plans due to tariff issues between the United States and China.[157]\n\n\n\n### Trucks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1939 Ford V-8 pick-up truck\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1961 Ford H-Series truck\nFord has produced trucks since 1908, beginning with the Ford Model TT, followed by the Model AA, and the Model BB. Countries where Ford commercial vehicles are or were formerly produced include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada (also badged as Mercury), France, Germany, India, Netherlands, Philippines, Spain (badged Ebro too), Turkey, UK (badged also Fordson and Thames), and the United States.\n\n\nFrom the 1940s to the late 1970s, Ford's Ford F-Series was used as the base for light trucks for the North American market.\n\n\nMost of these ventures are now extinct. The European one that lasted longest was the lorries arm of Ford of Britain, which became part of the Iveco group in 1986. Ford had a minority share in the new company and Iveco took over sales and production of the Ford Cargo range.[158] Ford's last significant European truck models were the Transcontinental and the Cargo. At the end of 1996, Ford sold the rights to its heavy trucks division to the Freightliner Trucks division of Daimler AG, with Ford producing the Cargo, Louisville, and Aeromax, through the 1998 model year. During the 1998 model year, Freightliner began production of its own versions of Ford-developed trucks in St. Thomas, Ontario, launching the Sterling truck brand.[159][160] Slotted between Freightliner and Western Star, Sterling trucks were produced through 2009.\n\n\nLine of heavy trucks made by Ford for the North American market:\n\n\n\n* Ford F-Series\n\t+ \"Big Job\" (1951-1957)\n\t+ \"Super Duty/Extra Heavy Duty (1958-1962)\n* Ford N-Series (1963-1969)\n* Ford L-Series trucks (1970-1998)\n\t+ aka Ford \"Louisville Line\"\n\t+ Ford Aeromax (1988-1998)\n\t+ Ford Louisville (1996-1998)\n\t+ Sterling (1998-2009)\n* Ford C-Series (1957-1990)\n* Ford Cargo/CF-Series (1986-1997)\n* Ford H-Series (1961-1966)\n\t+ aka \"Two-story Falcon\"\n* Ford W-Series (1966-1977)\n* Ford CL-Series (1978-1995)\n\n\nFor 1999, Ford briefly withdrew from production of medium-duty trucks. For the 2001 model year, the company entered into a joint venture with Navistar International (the supplier of diesel engines for 1-ton F-Series trucks), named *Blue Diamond Truck Company LLC*.[161] As part of the joint venture, sharing a common truck chassis, the two companies would produce medium-duty (Class 6–7) trucks in a Navistar facility in Mexico, with each manufacturer supplying its own powertrain and bodywork, with the Ford F-650/F-750 Super Duty and International 4000/DuraStar sharing an assembly line. In 2006, the joint venture debuted the Ford LCF/International CityStar.[162] Using a modified F-Series chassis adopted to fit a Mazda Titan cab, the LCF was a low-cab forward truck that was sold through 2009.[163]\n\n\nIn Europe, Ford manufactures the Ford Transit jumbo van, which is classed as a Large Goods Vehicle and has a payload of up to 2,265 kg; there are options of a panel van, pickup or chassis cab. The Ford Transit is also available as a light van called the Ford Transit Connect and the Ford Ranger pickup is available.[164]\n\n\n\n### Buses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford B700 bus chassis, with a body by Thomas Built\nFord manufactured complete buses in the company's early history, but today the role of the company has changed to that of a second stage manufacturer. In North America, the E-Series is still used as a chassis for small school buses and the F-650 is used in commercial bus markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, the medium-duty B700 was a popular chassis used by school bus body manufacturers including Thomas Built, Ward, and Blue Bird, but Ford lost its market share due to industry contraction and agreements between body manufacturers.

Originally a front-engine design, it was modified to a rear-engine design in 1939. About 1,000 to 1,200 of the original design were built, and around 12,500 of the rear-engine design, which was in production until 1947[165] (rebranded as the Universal Bus in 1946).\n\n\nRear-engine Transit Bus chassis model numbers:[166]\n\n\n\n* 09-B/19-B City transit bus – 1939–1941\n* 19-B/29-B City transit bus – 1941–1942\n* 49-B/79-B City transit bus – 1944–1947\n* 69-B City transit bus – 1946–1947\n* 29-B City transit bus – 1946–1947\n* 72-T transit bus – 1944–1945\n\n\nAfter 1946 the Transit City bus was sold as the *Universal Bus* with the roof changed from fabric/wood to all-metal:\n\n\n\n* 79-B Universal transit bus – 1946–1947\n\n\nSucceeding the Ford Transit Bus was the Ford 8M buses:\n\n\n\n* 8MB transit bus – with Wayne Works 1948–?\n\n\nFollowing World War II and from the 1950s onwards, Ford lost out to General Motors.[166] This led to the end of transit buses for Ford in North America.\n\n\n\n* B500 or B-series – 1950–1990s based on Ford F-series truck chassis used by school bus body manufacturers\n\n\nIn Europe, Ford manufactures the Ford Transit Minibus which is classed in Europe as a Passenger Carrying Vehicle and there are options of 12-, 15-, or 17-seaters.[167] In the past, European models included:\n\n\n\n* EM\n* N-138\n* D series buses (Australia)\n\n\n### Tractors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford N series tractor\nThe \"Henry Ford and Son Company\" began making Fordson tractors in Henry's hometown of Springwells (later part of Dearborn), Michigan, from 1907 to 1928, from 1919 to 1932, at Cork, Ireland, and between 1933 and 1964 at Dagenham, England, later transferred to Basildon. They were also produced in Leningrad beginning in 1924.\n\n\nFord reentered the tractor market in 1939 with the Ford N-series tractors. The Ford 8N, introduced in 1947, became the most popular tractor of all time in North America. Production of the N line of models ended in 1952.\n\n\nThe Ford NAA tractor was introduced as an entirely new model in 1953. It was a replacement for the Ford N-Series tractors. Larger than the 8N, with a four-cylinder engine, and streamlined styling.\n\n\nIn 1986, Ford expanded its tractor business when it purchased the Sperry-New Holland skid-steer loader and hay baler, hay tools and implement company from Sperry Corporation and formed Ford-New Holland which bought out Versatile tractors in 1988. This company was bought by Fiat in 1993 and the name changed from Ford New Holland to New Holland. New Holland is now part of CNH Global.\n\n\n\n### Financial services[edit]\n\n\nFord offers automotive finance through Ford Motor Credit Company.\n\n\n\n### Automotive components[edit]\n\n\nFord's *FoMoCo* parts division sells aftermarket parts under the Motorcraft brand name. It has spun off its parts division under the name Visteon.\n\n\n\n## FordWorks Program[edit]\n\n\nFord Motor Company created the FordWorks program in 2016[168][169] with the aim to bring people with disabilities back into the workforce.[170] It was the first automotive program to focus on bringing people with autism in the workforce in the US. They targeted people with autism[168][169] but have expanded their criteria to people with other disabilities.[170] Ford has partnered with Upbound to broaden their hiring under the FordWorks program.[170]\n\n\n\n## Marques[edit]\n\n\n### Current marques[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Marque\n | Estab.\n | Added | Markets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) US | Ford | 1903 | 1903 | Global\n |\n| ![](image) US | Lincoln | 1917 | 1922 | North America, Middle East, China, South Korea\n |\n\n\n### Former marques[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Marque\n | Years | Markets\n | Fate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) US | Continental[171][172] | 1956–1986 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) US | Edsel | 1957–1960 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) US | Fordson | 1917–1964 | North America, Ireland, U.K. | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) US | Mercury | 1939–2011 | North America, Middle East | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) US | Merkur | 1985–1989 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) AUS | FPV | 2002–2014 | Australia | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) BRA | Troller | 2007–2021 | Brazil | Defunct company, plant closed by Ford Brasil |\n| ![](image) JPN | Mazda | 1974–2015 | Global | Sold shares\n |\n| ![](image) SWE | Volvo | 1999–2010 | Global | Sold to Geely |\n| ![](image) UK | Aston Martin | 1989–2007 | Global | Sold to a private consortium\n |\n| ![](image) UK | Jaguar | 1989–2008 | Global | Sold to Tata Motors |\n| ![](image) UK | Land Rover | 2000–2008 | Global | Sold to Tata Motors |\n| ![](image) ITA | De Tomaso | 1971–1974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image) ITA | Moto Guzzi | 1973–1974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image) ITA | Benelli | 1972–1974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image) CAN | Meteor | 1949–1976 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) CAN | Monarch | 1946–1961 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image) CAN | Frontenac | 1960 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n\n\n## Motorsport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Performance\n\n### FIA World Championships[edit]\n\n\nAlong with Shelby and Chevrolet, Ford is one of only three American constructors to win titles on the international scene at the FIA World Championships. As a constructor, Ford won the World Sportscar Championship three times in 1966 (both sports prototype category and Grand Touring (GT) category), 1967 (GT category), and 1968 (sports prototype category), and at the World Rally Championship Ford won 4 World Drivers' Championships (in 1979, 1981, 2017 and 2018) as well as 4 World Manufacturers' Championships (in 1979, 2006, 2007 and 2017). As an engine supplier, Ford also won 13 Formula One World Drivers' Championships and 10 Formula One World Constructors' Championships.\n\n\n\n### Open-wheel racing[edit]\n\n\n#### IndyCar[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arie Luyendyk's record-setting Ford Cosworth-powered IndyCar from 1996\nIndyCars with Ford engines first competed in 1935 using a production-based Ford V8 in the Miller-Ford racer.[173][174] A pushrod Ford V8 raced with Lotus in 1963, and Ford's first Indy win was in 1965 with a DOHC V8.[175][176] Ford motors, including the Ford-sponsored DFX engine developed by Cosworth, have won the Indianapolis 500 eighteen times.[177] On May 12, 1996, Arie Luyendyk, while driving an IndyCar powered by a Ford Cosworth XB engine, broke the Indianapolis 500 records for fastest qualification lap (237.498 mph; 382.216 km/h) and fastest qualification four-lap average (236.986 mph; 381.392 km/h).[178][179] These speed records still stand as of 2022[update].[180]\n\n\n\n#### Formula Ford[edit]\n\n\nFormula Ford, conceived in the UK in 1966, is an entry-level type of formula racing with wingless single-seater cars. Many of today's formula racing drivers started their car racing careers in this category.\n\n\n\n#### Formula One[edit]\n\n\nFord was heavily involved in Formula One for many years and supplied engines to a large number of teams from 1967 until 2004. These engines were designed and manufactured by Cosworth, the racing division that was owned by Ford from 1998 to 2004. Ford-badged engines won 176 Grands Prix between 1967 and 2003 for teams such as Team Lotus and McLaren. Ford entered Formula One as a constructor in 2000 under the Jaguar Racing name, after buying the Stewart Grand Prix team which had been its primary 'works' team in the series since 1997. Jaguar achieved little success in Formula One, and after a turbulent five seasons, Ford withdrew from the category after the 2004 season, selling both Jaguar Racing (which became Red Bull Racing) and Cosworth (to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven).[181]\n\n\nFord has announced that it will return to Formula One in 2026 following a partnership with Red Bull Powertrains, supplying power units to Red Bull Racing and Scuderia AlphaTauri.[182]\n\n\n\n### Stock car racing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ryan Blaney driving the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford in 2016 at Michigan International Speedway\nFord is one of three manufacturers in NASCAR's three major series: the Cup Series, Xfinity Series, and Truck Series. Major teams include RFK Racing, Team Penske, Stewart-Haas Racing, and Wood Brothers Racing. Ford is represented by the Mustang GT in the Cup Series, and the Xfinity Series and by the F-150 in the Truck Series. Some of the most successful NASCAR Fords were the aerodynamic fastback Ford Torino, Ford Torino Talladega, Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II, and Mercury Montegos, and the aero-era Ford Thunderbirds. The Ford nameplate has won eight manufacturer's championships in Sprint Cup while Mercury has won one. In the Sprint Cup Series, Ford earned its 1,000th victory in the 2013 Quicken Loans 400.[183] The Ford Fusion is also used in the ARCA Racing Series. Ford had last won a drivers' championship in the Cup Series with Joey Logano in 2022.\n\n\n\n### Rally[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford World Rally Team\n\n![](image)Jari-Matti Latvala driving the Ford Focus RS WRC 09 in 2010\nFord has a long history in rallying and has been active in the World Rally Championship since the beginning of the world championship, the 1973 season. Ford took the 1979 manufacturers' title with Hannu Mikkola, Björn Waldegård, and Ari Vatanen driving the Ford Escort RS1800. In the Group B era, Ford achieved success with Ford RS200. Since the 1999 season, Ford has used various versions of the Ford Focus WRC to much success. In the 2006 season, BP-Ford World Rally Team secured Ford its second manufacturers' title, with the Focus RS WRC 06 built by M-Sport and driven by \"Flying Finns\" Marcus Grönholm and Mikko Hirvonen.[184] Continuing with Grönholm and Hirvonen, Ford successfully defended the manufacturers' world championship in the 2007 season. Ford is the only manufacturer to score in the points for 92 consecutive races; since the 2002 season opener Monte Carlo Rally.[185]\n\n\n\n### Rallycross[edit]\n\n\nFord has competed in rallycross with its Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus. Tanner Foust won the Global RallyCross Championship in 2011 and 2012 and was runner-up in the FIA European Rallycross Championship in 2011 and 2012. Toomas Heikkinen won the Global RallyCross Championship title in 2013 and Joni Wiman won it in 2014. Other notable Ford drivers include Marcus Grönholm, Ken Block, and Brian Deegan.\n\n\n\n### Sports cars[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford GT § Racing\n\nFord sports cars have been visible in the world of sports car racing since 1964. Most notably the Ford GT40 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times (in 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969) and is the only American car to ever win overall at this prestigious event. Ford also won four titles at the World Sportscar Championship with the GT40. Swiss team Matech GT Racing, in collaboration with Ford Racing, opened a new chapter with the Ford GT, winning the Teams title in the 2008 FIA GT3 European Championship.\n\n\n\n#### Ford Mustang[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Mustang § Racing\n\n![](image)A GT racing version of the Ford Mustang, competing in the Koni Challenge in 2005\nThe Ford Mustang has arguably been Ford's most successful sports car. Jerry Titus won the 1965 SCCA Pro B National Championship with a Mustang and the model went on to earn Ford the SCCA Trans-Am Championship title in both 1966 and 1967. Ford won the Trans-Am Championship again in 1970 with Parnelli Jones and George Follmer driving Boss 302 Mustangs for Bud Moore Engineering. Ford took the 1985 and 1986 IMSA GTO Championship with Mustangs driven by John Jones and Scott Pruett before returning to Trans-Am glory with a championship in 1989 with Dorsey Schroeder. Ford dominated Trans-Am in the 1990s with Tommy Kendall winning championships in 1993, 1995, 1996, and 1997 with Paul Gentilozzi adding yet another title in 1999. In 2005 the Ford Mustang FR500C took the championship in the Rolex Koni Challenge Series in its first year on the circuit. In 2007, Ford added a victory in the GT4 European Championship. 2008 was the first year of the Mustang Challenge for the Miller Cup, a series that pits a full field of identical factory-built Ford Mustang race cars against each other. Also, in 2008, Ford won the manufacturers championship in the Koni Challenge Series and HyperSport drivers Joe Foster and Steve Maxwell won the drivers title in a Mustang GT.\n\n\nFord and Michelin teamed up to provide custom-engineered tires for the Ford Performance vehicle lineup. Ford Performance director Dave Pericak said: \"That confidence extends from our upcoming racing effort at Le Mans in 2016 with the all-new Ford GT, to the Ford Performance vehicle lineup, including the Shelby GT350 and F-150 Raptor\".[186]\n\n\n\n### Touring cars[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford Performance Racing Ford Falcon V8 Supercar at Eastern Creek in Australia in 2008\nFord has campaigned touring cars such as the Focus, Falcon, and Contour/Mondeo and the Sierra Cosworth in many different series throughout the years. Notably, Mondeo drivers finished 1, 2, and 3 in the 2000 British Touring Car Championship and Falcon drivers placed 1, 2, and 3 in the 2005 V8 Supercar Championship Series.\n\n\n\n### Drag racing[edit]\n\n\nIn drag racing, John Force Racing drivers John Force, Tony Pedregon, and Robert Hight have piloted Ford Mustang Funny Cars to several NHRA titles in recent seasons. Teammates Tim Wilkerson and Bob Tasca III also drive Mustangs in Funny Car.\n\n\n\n### Drifting[edit]\n\n\nFord has branched out into drifting with the introduction of the new model Mustang. Most noticeable is the Turquoise and Blue Falken Tires Mustang driven by Vaughn Gittin, Jr., (A.K.A. \"JR\") that produces 750 RWHP (Rear Wheel Horsepower).\n\n\n\n## Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\n### Compressed natural gas[edit]\n\n\nThe alternative fossil fuel vehicles, such as some versions of the Crown Victoria especially in fleet and taxi service, operate on compressed natural gas—or CNG. Some CNG vehicles have dual fuel tanks—one for gasoline, the other for CNG—the same engine can operate on either fuel via a selector switch.\n\n\n\n### Flexible fuel vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Ford Focus Flexifuel was the first E85 flexible fuel vehicle commercially available in the European market.\nFlexible fuel vehicles are designed to operate smoothly using a wide range of available ethanol fuel mixtures—from pure gasoline to bioethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) or E100 (neat hydrous ethanol) in Brazil. Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles in the U.S. is the general lack of establishment of sufficient fueling stations, which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive to a wide range of consumers. Significant efforts to ramp up production and distribution of E85 fuels are underway and expanding.[187] Current Ford E100 Flex sold in the Brazilian market are the Courier, Ford EcoSport, Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus, and Ford Ka.\n\n\n\n### Electric drive vehicles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Bush at the Kansas City Assembly plant in Claycomo, Missouri, on March 20, 2007, touting Ford's new hybrid cars\nIn 2004, Ford and Toyota agreed a patent-sharing accord that granted Ford access to certain hybrid technology patented by Toyota; in exchange, Ford licensed some of its own patents to Toyota.[188][189][190] In 2004, Ford introduced the Escape Hybrid. With this vehicle, Ford was third to the automotive market with a hybrid electric vehicle and the first hybrid electric SUV to market. This was also the first hybrid electric vehicle with a flexible fuel capability to run on E85.[191] The Escape's platform mate Mercury Mariner was also available with the hybrid-electric system in the 2006 model year—a full year ahead of schedule. The similar Mazda Tribute will also receive a hybrid-electric powertrain option, along with many other vehicles in the Ford vehicle line.\n\n\nIn 2005, Ford announced a goal to make 250,000 hybrids a year by 2010, but by mid-2006 announced that it would not meet that goal, due to excessively high costs and the lack of sufficient supplies of the hybrid-electric batteries and drivetrain system components.[192] Instead, Ford has committed to accelerating development of next-generation hybrid-electric power plants in Britain, in collaboration with Volvo. This engineering study is expected to yield more than 100 new hybrid-electric vehicle models and derivatives.\n\n\nIn September 2007, Ford announced a partnership with Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine how plug-in hybrids will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles will be evaluated \"in typical customer settings\", according to Ford.[35][36]\n\n\nOn June 12, 2008, USDOE expanded its own fleet of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with the addition of a Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid Flex-Fuel Vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a 10-kilowatt (13 hp) lithium-ion battery supplied by Johnson Controls-Saft that stores enough electric energy to drive up to 30 miles (48 km) at speeds of up to 40 mph (64 km/h).[193] In March 2009, Ford launched hybrid versions of the Ford Fusion Hybrid and the Mercury Milan Hybrid in the United States, both as 2010 models.[194]\n\n\nAs of November 2014[update], Ford has produced for retail sales the following hybrid electric vehicles: Ford Escape Hybrid (2004–2012), Mercury Mariner Hybrid (2005–2010), Mercury Milan Hybrid (2009–2010), Ford Fusion Hybrid (2009–present), Lincoln MKZ Hybrid (2010–present), Ford C-Max Hybrid (2012–present), and Ford Mondeo Hybrid (2014–present). By June 2012, Ford had sold 200,000 full hybrids in the U.S. since 2004,[195] and, as of September 2014[update], the carmaker has sold over 344,000 hybrids in the United States.[195][196][197][198] The top selling hybrids in the U.S. market are the Fusion Hybrid with 127,572 units, followed by Escape Hybrid with 117,997 units, and the C-Max Hybrid with 54,236.[196][197][198][199][200] As of November 2014[update], Ford is the world's second-largest manufacturer of hybrids after Toyota Motor Corporation, with 400,000 hybrid electric vehicles produced since their introduction in 2004.[201]\n\n\n\n#### Plug-in electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Plug-in electric vehicle\n\nAs of October 2014[update], Ford has produced the following plug-in electric vehicles: the all-electric Ford Ranger EV (1997–2002), Ford TH!NK (1999–2003), Transit Connect (2010–2012), and Ford Focus Electric (2011–2018); and the plug-in hybrids C-MAX Energi (2012–2017) and the Fusion Energi (2013–2020), sold under the Mondeo nameplate in Europe.[202][203] Since the launch of the Focus Electric in 2011, combined sales of all Ford plug-in electric models amounted to just over 56,000 through October 2015.[204]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Azure Transit Connect Electric was produced between 2010 and 2012 as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company.\nBill Ford was one of the first top industry executives to make regular use of a battery electric vehicle, a Ford Ranger EV, while the company contracted with the United States Postal Service to deliver electric postal vans based on the Ranger EV platform. Ford discontinued a line of electric Ranger pickup trucks and ordered them destroyed, though it reversed in January 2005, after environmentalist protest.[205] The all-electric pickup truck leased 205 units to individuals and 1,500 units to fleets in the U.S. from 1998 to 2002.[206][207]\n\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Ford offered the Ford TH!NK car. Ford ended production and ordered all the cars repossessed and destroyed, even as many of the people leasing them begged to be able to buy the cars from Ford. After an outcry from the lessees and activists in the U.S. and Norway, Ford returned the cars to Norway for sale.[208] Four hundred and forty units were leased in the U.S. from 1999 until 2003.[207]\n\n\nIn 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that the company would invest $4.5 billion in further development of plug-in electric vehicles by 2020.[209]\n\n\nThe Azure Transit Connect Electric was an all-electric van developed as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company, but Azure was the official manufacturer of record.[210] The Transit Connect Electric had an official U.S. Environmental Protection Agency all-electric range of 56 mi (90 km).[211] The EPA rated the combined city/highway fuel economy at 62 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (3.8 L/100 km equivalent).[211] Deliveries for fleet customers in the U.S. and Canada began in December 2010.[212] Production of the electric van was stopped in March 2012 as a result of Azure's bankruptcy protection filing. Ford continues to provide servicing.[213] Around 500 units were sold before Azure stopped production.[214]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid shares its powertrain with the Ford C-Max Energi.\nThe Ford Focus Electric is based on the next generation Focus internal combustion vehicle, converted to an all-electric propulsion system as a production electric car by Magna International, and retail sales began in the U.S. in December 2011.[215][216] The Focus Electric has an EPA rated range of 76 mi (122 km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy of 105 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.2 L/100 km).[217] Available also in Canada and several European countries, 3,965 units have been sold in the U.S. through September 2014.[196][197][198][218]\n\n\nThe Ford C-Max Energi is a plug-in hybrid released in the U.S. in October 2012. The C-Max Energi has an EPA rated all-electric range of 20 mi (32 km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode at 88 MPG-e (2.7 L/100 km).[219] U.S. sales totaled 33,509 units through December 2016.[196][197][220][221][222] Deliveries of the Ford Fusion Energi began in the United States in February 2013.[223][224] The Fusion Energi has an all-electric range of 20 mi (32 km) and an equivalent fuel economy EPA rating of 88 MPG-e (2.7 L/100 km).[219] As of December 2016[update], a total of 43,327 units have been delivered in the U.S. since its inception.[197][220][221][222]\n\n\nBoth Energi models share the same powertrain technology and have the same EPA combined city/highway fuel economy in hybrid operation of 38 mpg‑US (6.2 L/100 km; 46 mpg‑imp).[219]\nWhen asked about a battery-electric vehicle with a 200-mile (320 km) range, Fields said in April 2016 \"Clearly that's something we're developing for\". Ford has a pending trademark application on the \"Model E\" name,[225] preventing the Tesla Model 3 in using the name.[226]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Ford announced its Team Edison battery-electric vehicle group to lead the company's renewed efforts into the EV market, in which it currently offers only the Focus subcompact and has plans for a small 300-mile SUV by 2020.[227] The new team will be headquartered in Detroit and have offices in Europe and Asia.[228]\n\n\nIn 2022, Ford began manufacturing its E-Transit electric cargo vans at its plant in Kansas City, Missouri.[229]\n\n\n\n![a photograph showing the front-left quarter of a grey automobile](image)Ford Mustang Mach-E\n### Hydrogen[edit]\n\n\nFord also continues to study fuel cell-powered electric powertrains and has demonstrated hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. Compared with conventional vehicles, hybrid vehicles and/or fuel cell vehicles decrease air pollution emissions as well as sound levels, with favorable impacts upon respiratory health and decrease of noise health effects.\n\n\nFord has launched the production of hydrogen-powered shuttle buses, using hydrogen instead of gasoline in a standard internal combustion engine, for use at airports and convention centers.[230] At the 2006 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, Ford showcased a hydrogen fuel cell version of its Explorer SUV. The Fuel cell Explorer has a combined output of 174 hp (130 kW). It has a large hydrogen storage tank which is situated in the center of the car taking the original place of the conventional model's automatic transmission. The centered position of the tank assists the vehicle reach a notable range of 350 miles (563 km), the farthest for a fuel cell vehicle so far. The fuel cell Explorer the first in a series of prototypes partly funded by the United States Department of Energy to expand efforts to determine the feasibility of hydrogen-powered vehicles. The fuel cell Explorer is one of several vehicles with green technology being featured at the L.A. show, including the 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid, PZEV emissions compliant Fusion and Focus models and a 2008 Ford F-Series Super Duty outfitted with Ford's clean diesel technology.\n\n\n\n### Increased fuel efficiency[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Ford Motor Company announced that it would accelerate its plans to produce more fuel-efficient cars, changing both its North American manufacturing plans and its lineup of vehicles available in the United States. In terms of North American manufacturing, the company planned to convert three existing truck and sport utility vehicle (SUV) plants for small car production, with the first conversion at its Michigan Truck Plant. In addition, Ford's assembly plants near Mexico City, Mexico, and in Louisville, Kentucky, were to be converted from pickups and SUVs to small cars, including the Ford Fiesta, by 2011. Ford then also planned to introduce to North America six of its European small vehicles, including two versions of the Ford Fiesta, by the end of 2012.[231]\n\n\nFord of Europe developed the ECOnetic programme to address the market and legislative need for higher fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions. As opposed to the hybrid engine technology used in competitor products such as the Toyota Prius, ECOnetic improves existing technology. Using lower-consuming Duratorq TDCi diesel engines, and based on a combination of improved aerodynamics, lower resistance, and improved efficiency, the Ford Fiesta was the lowest-emitting mass-produced car in Europe[232] while the 2012 Ford Focus ECOnetic will have better fuel consumption than the Prius or the Volkswagen Golf BlueMotion.[233] ECOnetic is not presently planned to be sold in North American due to current perceived lower consumer demand.[234]\n\n\nFord has challenged University teams to create a vehicle that is simple, durable, lightweight, and comes equipped with a base target price of only $7,000. The students from Aachen University created the \"2015 Ford Model T\".[235][236]\n\n\nIn 2000, under the leadership of the current Ford chairman, William Clay Ford, the company announced[237] a planned 25 percent improvement in the average mileage of its SUVs—to be completed by the 2005 calendar year. In 2003, Ford announced that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent the company from achieving this goal.[238]\n\n\nFor the 2007 model year, Ford had thirteen U.S. models that achieve 30 miles per gallon or better (based on the highway fuel economy estimates of the EPA) and several of Ford's vehicles were recognized in the EPA and Department of Energy Fuel Economy Guide for best-in-class fuel economy. Ford claimed to have eliminated nearly three million pounds of smog-forming emissions from their U.S. cars and light trucks over the 2004 to 2006 model years.[239] However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has linked Ford to 54 Superfund toxic waste sites, twelve of which have been cleaned up and deleted from the list.[240]\n\n\n\n### Efficient buildings[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a renovation of the Ford River Rouge Complex, in 2010 Ford unveiled a 10.4-acre (42,000 m2) living roof covering part of the Dearborn Truck plant, consisting of sedum, a low-growing groundcover. The sedum retains and cleanses rainwater and moderates the internal temperature of the building, saving energy.[241]\n\n\nIn 2016, Ford announced a ten-year renovation plan for its Dearborn campus.[242] The plan features consolidation of office and lab spaces in to fewer and much larger buildings, which will be built to LEED standards, and will feature extensive use of wetlands and park spaces.[243][244] The new campus features new multi-story parking decks with solar power-generating roofs,[245] and a new natural gas power plant. The DTE Ford Central Energy Plant is a 34MW combined heat-and-power plant which features a high efficiency design and LEED Gold buildings.[246]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nFord sponsors numerous events and sports facilities around the U.S., most notably the Ford Center in downtown Evansville, Indiana, and Ford Field in downtown Detroit.[247]\n\n\nThe company has also been a major sponsor of the UEFA Champions League for over two decades, and is also a longtime sponsor of the Sky media channel's coverage of Premier League football.\n\n\nBetween 1994 and 1999, Ford was the main kit sponsor of German Bundesliga club 1. FC Köln.\n\n\n\n## Sales numbers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Calendar Year\n | US sales\n | Market share\nof US sales[248]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997\n | 3,877,458[249] | 25.0%\n |\n| 1998\n | 3,922,604[250] | 24.5%\n |\n| 1999\n | 4,163,369[251] | 23.9%\n |\n| 2000\n | 4,202,820\n | 23.6%\n |\n| 2001\n | 3,971,364\n | 22.7%\n |\n| 2002\n | 3,623,709[252] | 21.2%\n |\n| 2003\n | 3,483,719\n | 20.5%\n |\n| 2004\n | 3,331,676[253] | 19.3%\n |\n| 2005\n | 3,153,875\n | 18.1%\n |\n| 2006\n | 2,901,090[254] | 17.0%\n |\n| 2007\n | 2,507,366\n | 15.2%\n |\n| 2008\n | 1,988,376[255] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2009\n | 1,620,888[256] | 15.3%\n |\n| 2010\n | 1,935,462[257] | 16.4%\n |\n| 2011\n | 2,143,101[258] | 16.4%\n |\n| 2012\n | 2,250,165[259] | 15.2%\n |\n| 2013\n | 2,493,918[260] | 15.7%\n |\n| 2014\n | 2,480,942[261] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2015\n | 2,613,162[262] | 14.6%\n |\n| 2016\n | 2,614,697[263][264] | 14.6%\n |\n| 2017\n | 2,586,715[265] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,497,318[265] | 14.1%\n |\n| 2019\n | 2,422,698[266] | 13.8%\n |\n| 2020\n | 2,044,744[267] | 13.7%\n |\n| 2021\n | 1,905,955[268] | 12.4%\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cars portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![flag](image)Michigan portal\n\n\n* Ford's Garage\n* Bridj\n* Chariot (company)\n* Detroit Automobile Company\n* Dodge v.
