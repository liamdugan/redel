You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\n![](image)\nIndian record label T-Series is the most-subscribed channel, with over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023.[update]\n![](image)\nAmerican YouTube personality MrBeast is the most-subscribed individual and second most-subscribed channel overall, with 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[update]\n\nA subscriber to a channel on the American video-sharing platform YouTube is a user who has chosen to receive the channel's content by clicking on that channel's \"Subscribe\" button, and each user's subscription feed consists of videos published by channels to which the user is subscribed.[1] The ability to subscribe to users was introduced in October 2005.[2] YouTube began publishing a list of its most-subscribed channels in April 2006.[3] An early archive of the list dates to May 2006.[4]\n\n\nSince mid-2006, when Smosh occupied the top position with less than 3,000 subscribers,[4] at least 10 other YouTube channels have held the top spot; these include American fictional character Bree Avery, American comedian Brooke \"Brookers\" Brodack, American fictional character Fred Figglehorn, Swedish gamer Felix \"PewDiePie\" Kjellberg, American comedian Ryan Higa, American media personality Ray William Johnson, American public speaker Judson Laipply, and English geriatric Peter Oakley.\n\n\nThe most-subscribed channel is the Indian record label T-Series, which hosts its music videos on its channel. With over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023, the channel has held the top position since April 14, 2019.[5][6] The most-subscribed channel which is not 'branded' (i.e., does not belong to an organization or company) is that of American YouTuber MrBeast, who is the second most-subscribed channel overall, with over 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## 50 most-subscribed channels[edit]\n\n\nThe following table lists the 50 most-subscribed YouTube channels,[A][6] as well as the primary language and content category of each channel. The channels are ordered by number of subscribers. Those whose displayed subscriber counts are identical, are listed so that the channel whose current growth rate indicates that its displayed subscriber count will exceed that of the other channel is listed first. Automatically generated channels that lack their own videos, such as Music and News, and channels that have been made effectively obsolete as a result of the transferral of their content, such as JustinBieberVEVO and TaylorSwiftVEVO[B] are excluded. \n\n\nAs of November 2023, 20 of the 50 channels listed primarily produce content in English while 17 primarily produce content in Hindi. All 50 channels have surpassed 45 million subscribers, 41 of them have surpassed 50 million subscribers, 27 of them have surpassed 60 million subscribers, 19 of them have surpassed 70 million subscribers, 14 of them have surpassed 80 million subscribers, 12 of them have surpassed 90 million and 9 of them have surpassed 100 million subscribers.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Link\n | Brand

During the competition, both channels gained a large number of subscribers at a rapid rate, and surpassed each other's subscriber count on multiple occasions in February, March, and April 2019.[52][53][54][56] T-Series eventually permanently surpassed PewDiePie, and on May 29, 2019 it became the first channel to reach 100 million subscribers.[72]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Lists portal\n\n\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n* List of most-liked YouTube videos\n* List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-viewed Indian YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Pakistani YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Arabic music videos on YouTube\n* List of most-viewed French music videos on YouTube\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The total number of channels listed may exceed 50 if a tie exists for the 50th-highest subscriber count.\n2. **^** These are not to be mistaken for the channels Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, both of which are included.\n3. **^** Although now called simply \"YouTube\", YouTube's official channel was named \"YouTube Spotlight\" in 2013.\n4. **^** T-Series surpassed PewDiePie in subscriber count on numerous occasions, each lasting fewer than 24 hours, from February to late March 2019.[52][53][54] The first incident to last at least 24 hours began on March 27 and ended on April 1.[55][56]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Quickstart Guide to YouTube – Lesson 2: YouTube Basics\". *YouTube Creator Academy*.

You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\n![](image)\nIndian record label T-Series is the most-subscribed channel, with over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023.[update]\n![](image)\nAmerican YouTube personality MrBeast is the most-subscribed individual and second most-subscribed channel overall, with 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[update]\n\nA subscriber to a channel on the American video-sharing platform YouTube is a user who has chosen to receive the channel's content by clicking on that channel's \"Subscribe\" button, and each user's subscription feed consists of videos published by channels to which the user is subscribed.[1] The ability to subscribe to users was introduced in October 2005.[2] YouTube began publishing a list of its most-subscribed channels in April 2006.[3] An early archive of the list dates to May 2006.[4]\n\n\nSince mid-2006, when Smosh occupied the top position with less than 3,000 subscribers,[4] at least 10 other YouTube channels have held the top spot; these include American fictional character Bree Avery, American comedian Brooke \"Brookers\" Brodack, American fictional character Fred Figglehorn, Swedish gamer Felix \"PewDiePie\" Kjellberg, American comedian Ryan Higa, American media personality Ray William Johnson, American public speaker Judson Laipply, and English geriatric Peter Oakley.\n\n\nThe most-subscribed channel is the Indian record label T-Series, which hosts its music videos on its channel. With over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023, the channel has held the top position since April 14, 2019.[5][6] The most-subscribed channel which is not 'branded' (i.e., does not belong to an organization or company) is that of American YouTuber MrBeast, who is the second most-subscribed channel overall, with over 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## 50 most-subscribed channels[edit]\n\n\nThe following table lists the 50 most-subscribed YouTube channels,[A][6] as well as the primary language and content category of each channel. The channels are ordered by number of subscribers. Those whose displayed subscriber counts are identical, are listed so that the channel whose current growth rate indicates that its displayed subscriber count will exceed that of the other channel is listed first. Automatically generated channels that lack their own videos, such as Music and News, and channels that have been made effectively obsolete as a result of the transferral of their content, such as JustinBieberVEVO and TaylorSwiftVEVO[B] are excluded. \n\n\nAs of November 2023, 20 of the 50 channels listed primarily produce content in English while 17 primarily produce content in Hindi. All 50 channels have surpassed 45 million subscribers, 41 of them have surpassed 50 million subscribers, 27 of them have surpassed 60 million subscribers, 19 of them have surpassed 70 million subscribers, 14 of them have surpassed 80 million subscribers, 12 of them have surpassed 90 million and 9 of them have surpassed 100 million subscribers.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Link\n | Brand

During the competition, both channels gained a large number of subscribers at a rapid rate, and surpassed each other's subscriber count on multiple occasions in February, March, and April 2019.[52][53][54][56] T-Series eventually permanently surpassed PewDiePie, and on May 29, 2019 it became the first channel to reach 100 million subscribers.[72]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Lists portal\n\n\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n* List of most-liked YouTube videos\n* List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-viewed Indian YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Pakistani YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Arabic music videos on YouTube\n* List of most-viewed French music videos on YouTube\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The total number of channels listed may exceed 50 if a tie exists for the 50th-highest subscriber count.\n2. **^** These are not to be mistaken for the channels Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, both of which are included.\n3. **^** Although now called simply \"YouTube\", YouTube's official channel was named \"YouTube Spotlight\" in 2013.\n4. **^** T-Series surpassed PewDiePie in subscriber count on numerous occasions, each lasting fewer than 24 hours, from February to late March 2019.[52][53][54] The first incident to last at least 24 hours began on March 27 and ended on April 1.[55][56]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Quickstart Guide to YouTube – Lesson 2: YouTube Basics\". *YouTube Creator Academy*.

Accessible worldwide,[7] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website in the world, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users,[8] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos every day.[9] As of May 2019[update], videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[10][11]\n\n\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[12] Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a greater audience.\n\n\nYouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite its growth and success, it has been widely criticized for allegedly facilitating the spread of misinformation and the sharing of copyrighted content, routinely violating its users' privacy, enabling censorship, endangering child safety and wellbeing, and for its inconsistent or incorrect implementation of platform guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of YouTube\n\n### Founding and initial growth (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, the founders of YouTube.\nYouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay.[14] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[15]\n\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[16]\n\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[17] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[16][18] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[19] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)The YouTube logo used from its launch until 2007;[*citation needed*] it returned in 2008 before being removed again in 2010.[*citation needed*] Another version of this logo without the \"Broadcast Yourself\" slogan was used until 2011.\nYouTube began as a venture capital–funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two.[14][21] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[22] In February 2005, the company activated `www.youtube.com`.[23] The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\nYouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was launched in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor.[31] The week of YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's *Saturday Night Live* ran a skit \"Lazy Sunday\" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for *Saturday Night Live*, \"Lazy Sunday\"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website.[32] Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns.[33] Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content.[34][35] The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[36]\n\n\nThe choice of the name `www.youtube.com` led to problems for a similarly named website, `www.utube.com`. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to `www.utubeonline.com`.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast Yourself era (2006–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California\nOn October 9, 2006, Google announced that it had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock.[39][40] The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[41][42] Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube.[31] It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself\".\nThe company experienced rapid growth. *The Daily Telegraph* wrote that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000.[43] By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos, according to comScore.[44] That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site.[45] In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every minute.[46][47][48] However, most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[49] That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red.[50][51] A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013.[52] By that point, more than 100 hours were being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014.[53][54]\n\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo from 2015 until 2017\nDuring this time, the company also went through some organizational changes. In October 2006, YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno, California.[55] Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as a chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company in October 2010.[56]\n\n\nIn December 2009, YouTube partnered with Vevo.[57] In April 2010, Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" became the most viewed video, becoming the first video to reach 200 million views on May 9, 2010.[58]\n\n\n\n### Susan Wojcicki and going mainstream (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo since 2017\nSusan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014.[59] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million. The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees.[60] YouTube officially launched the \"polymer\" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017.[61]\n\n\nThrough this period, YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond advertisements. In 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium, subscription-based channels.[62][63] This effort was discontinued in January 2018 and relaunched in June, with US$4.99 channel subscriptions.[64][65] These channel subscriptions complemented the existing Super Chat ability, launched in 2017, which allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment highlighted.[66] In 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as \"Music Key,\" which bundled ad-free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[67] The service continued to evolve in 2015 when YouTube announced YouTube Red, a new premium service that would offer ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year), premium original series, and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform.[68][69][70]\n\n\nThe company also attempted to create products appealing to specific viewers. YouTube released a mobile app known as YouTube Kids in 2015, designed to provide an experience optimized for children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control features.[71] Also in 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[72]\n\n\nThe company was attacked on April 3, 2018, when a shooting occurred at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California, which wounded four and resulted in the death of the shooter.[73]\n\n\n\n### Recent history (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\nBy February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute.[9][74] Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than 500 hours per minute.[10] During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-at-home orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased. One data firm[*which?*] estimated that YouTube was accounting for 15% of all internet traffic, twice its pre-pandemic level.[75] In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix stated they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's request.[76] YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.\"[77]\n\n\nFollowing a 2018 complaint alleging violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),[78] the company was fined $170 million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of 13.[79] YouTube was also ordered to create systems to increase children's privacy.[80][81] Following criticisms of its implementation of those systems, YouTube started treating all videos designated as \"made for kids\" as liable under COPPA on January 6, 2020.[82][83] Joining the YouTube Kids app, the company created a supervised mode, designed more for tweens, in 2021.[84] Additionally, to compete with TikTok, YouTube released YouTube Shorts, a short-form video platform.\n\n\nDuring this period, YouTube entered disputes with other tech companies. For over a year, in 2018 and 2019, no YouTube app was available for Amazon Fire products.[85] In 2020, Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement.[86]\n\n\nAfter testing earlier in 2021, YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November 2021, claiming the reason for the removal was, based on its internal research, that users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading.[87] While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls, others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as \"a stupid idea\", and that the real reason behind the change was \"not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed.\" He felt that users' ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential, saying, \"The process works, and there's a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines.\"[88][89][90] Shortly after the announcement, software developer Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike, an open-source, third-party browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video's number of dislikes.[91] In a letter published on January 25, 2022, by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, acknowledged that removing public dislike counts was a controversial decision, but reiterated that she stands by this decision, claiming that \"it reduced dislike attacks.\"[92]\n\n\nIn 2022, YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts, intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video. Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads, YouTube \"ended\" the experiment on September 19 of that year.[93] In October, YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles (e.g. @MrBeast6000) in addition to channel names, which would also become channel URLs.[94]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor. Wojcicki will take on an advisory role for Google and parent company Alphabet.[95]\n\n\nIn late October 2023, YouTube began cracking down on the use of ad blockers on the platform. Users of ad blockers may be given a pop-up warning saying \"Video player will be blocked after 3 videos\". Users of ad blockers are shown a message inviting them to subscribe to YouTube Premium. YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service.[96][97]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and held the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023.[95] The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023.[95]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Video technology[edit]\n\n\nYouTube primarily uses the VP9 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video codecs, and the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP protocol.[98] MPEG-4 Part 2 streams contained within 3GP containers are also provided for low bandwidth connections.[99] By January 2019, YouTube had begun rolling out videos in AV1 format.[100] In 2021 it was reported that the company was considering requiring AV1 in streaming hardware in order to decrease bandwidth and increase quality.[101] Video is usually streamed alongside the Opus and AAC audio codecs.[99]\n\n\nAt launch in 2005, viewing YouTube videos on a personal computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to be installed in the browser.[102] In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of Web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard.[103] This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed.[104] On January 27, 2015, YouTube announced that HTML5 would be the default playback method on supported browsers.[103] HTML5 video streams use Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), an HTTP-based adaptive bit-rate streaming solution optimizes the bitrate and quality for the available network.[105]\n\n\nThe platform can serve videos at optionally lower resolution levels starting at 144p for smoothening playback in areas and countries with limited Internet speeds, improving compatibility, as well as for the preservation of limited cellular data plans. The resolution can be adjusted automatically based on detected connection speed or set manually.[106][107]\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2017, users could add \"annotations\" to their videos, such as pop-up text messages and hyperlinks, which allowed for interactive videos. By 2019 all annotations had been removed from videos, breaking some videos that depended on the feature. YouTube introduced standardized widgets intended to replace annotations in a cross-platform manner, including \"end screens\" (a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video).[108][109][110]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube became an International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) registry, and announced its intention to begin creating ISNI identifiers to uniquely identify the musicians whose videos it features.[111]\n\n\nUsers can verify their account, normally through a mobile phone, to gain the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as produce live streams.[112][113] Users who have built sufficient channel history and have a good track record of complying with the site's Community Guidelines will also gain access to these aforementioned features as well.[114] When YouTube was launched in 2005, it was possible to upload longer videos, but a 10-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films.[115] The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010.[116] Videos can be at most 256 GB in size or 12 hours, whichever is less.[112] As of 2021[update], automatic closed captions using speech recognition technology when a video is uploaded are available in 13 languages, and can be machine-translated during playback.[117]\n\n\nYouTube also offers manual closed captioning as part of its creator studio.[118] YouTube formerly offered a 'Community Captions' feature, where viewers could write and submit captions for public display upon approval by the video uploader, but this was deprecated in September 2020.[119]\n\n\nYouTube accepts the most common container formats, including MP4, Matroska, FLV, AVI, WebM, 3GP, MPEG-PS, and the QuickTime File Format. Some intermediate video formats (i.e., primarily used for professional video editing, not for final delivery or storage) are also accepted, such as ProRes.[120] YouTube provides recommended encoding settings.[121]\n\n\nEach video is identified by an eleven-character case-sensitive alphanumerical Base64 string in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which can contain letters, digits, an underscore (`_`), and a dash (`-`).[122]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube added a feature called *Premiere* which displays a notification to the user mentioning when the video will be available for the first time, like for a live stream but with a prerecorded video. When the scheduled time arrives, the video is aired as a live broadcast with a two-minute countdown. Optionally, a premiere can be initiated immediately.[123]\n\n\n\n#### Quality and formats[edit]\n\n\nYouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320×240 pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec (a variant of H.263),[124][125] with mono MP3 audio.[126] In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3GP format on mobile phones.[127] In March 2008, a high-quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480×360 pixels.[128] In December 2008, 720p HD support was added. At the time of the 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9.[129] With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format. In November 2009, 1080p HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels.[130][131] In July 2010, support for 4K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 3840 × 2160 pixels.[132] In June 2015, support for 8K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels.[133] In November 2016, support for HDR video was added which can be encoded with hybrid log–gamma (HLG) or perceptual quantizer (PQ).[134] HDR video can be encoded with the Rec. 2020 color space.[135]\n\n\nIn June 2014, YouTube began to deploy support for high frame rate videos up to 60 frames per second (as opposed to 30 before), becoming available for user uploads in October. YouTube stated that this would enhance \"motion-intensive\" videos, such as video game footage.[136][137][138][139]\n\n\nYouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. Viewers only indirectly influence the video quality. In the mobile apps, users choose between \"Auto\", which adjusts resolution based on the internet connection, \"High Picture Quality\" which will prioritize playing high-quality video, \"Data saver\" which will sacrifice video quality in favor of low data usage and \"Advanced\" which lets the user choose a stream resolution.[140] On desktop, users choose between \"Auto\" and a specific resolution.[141] It is not possible for the viewer to directly choose a higher bitrate (quality) for any selected resolution.\n\n\nSince 2009, viewers have had the ability to watch 3D videos.[142] In 2015, YouTube began natively supporting 360-degree video. Since April 2016, it allowed live streaming 360° video, and both normal and 360° video at up to 1440p, and since November 2016 both at up to 4K (2160p) resolution.[143][144][145] Citing the limited number of users who watched more than 90-degrees, it began supporting an alternative stereoscopic video format known as VR180 which it said was easier to produce,[146] which allows users to watch any video using virtual reality headsets.[147]\n\n\nIn response to increased viewership during the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube temporarily downgraded the quality of its videos.[148][149] YouTube developed its own chip, called Argos, to help with encoding higher resolution videos in 2021.[150]\n\n\nIn certain cases, YouTube allows the uploader to upgrade the quality of videos uploaded a long time ago in poor quality. One such partnership with Universal Music Group included remasters of 1,000 music videos.[151]\n\n\n\n#### Live streaming[edit]\n\n\nYouTube carried out early experiments with live streaming, including its YouTube Live event in 2008,[152] a concert by U2 in 2009, and a question-and-answer session with US President Barack Obama in February 2010.[153] These tests had relied on technology from 3rd-party partners, but in September 2010, YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure.[154] In April 2011, YouTube announced the rollout of *YouTube Live*. The creation of live streams was initially limited to select partners.[155] It was used for real-time broadcasting of events such as the 2012 Olympics in London.[156] In October 2012, more than 8 million people watched Felix Baumgartner's jump from the edge of space as a live stream on YouTube.[157]\n\n\nIn May 2013, creation of live streams was opened to verified users with at least 1,000 subscribers; in August of the same year the number was reduced to 100 subscribers,[158] and in December the limit was removed.[159] In February 2017, live streaming was introduced to the official YouTube mobile app. Live streaming via mobile was initially restricted to users with at least 10,000 subscribers,[160] but as of mid-2017 it has been reduced to 100 subscribers.[161] Live streams support HDR, can be up to 4K resolution at 60 fps, and also support 360° video.[144][162]\n\n\n\n### User features[edit]\n\n\n#### Comment system [edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google § YouTube user comments\n\nMost videos enable users to leave comments, which have attracted attention for the negative aspects of their form and content.[*specify*] In 2006, *Time* praised Web 2.0 for enabling \"community and collaboration on a scale never seen before\", and added that YouTube \"harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred\".[163] *The Guardian* in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as:[164]\n\n\n\n\n> Juvenile, aggressive, misspelt, sexist, homophobic, swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL, YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance—with the occasional burst of wit shining through.\n> \n> \n\n\n*The Daily Telegraph* commented in September 2008, that YouTube was \"notorious\" for \"some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet\", and reported on YouTube Comment Snob, \"a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts\".[165] *The Huffington Post* noted in April 2012 that finding comments on YouTube that appear \"offensive, stupid and crass\" to the \"vast majority\" of the people is hardly difficult.[166]\n\n\nGoogle subsequently implemented a comment system oriented on Google+ on November 6, 2013, that required all YouTube users to use a Google+ account to comment on videos. The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone.[167] The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse.[168][169] In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change.[170] The official YouTube announcement[171] received 20,097 \"thumbs down\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.[172] Writing in the *Newsday* blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network like Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\" and added that \"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with the outcry against the new comment system\". In the same article Melvin goes on to say:[173]\n\n\n\n\n> Perhaps user complaints are justified, but the idea of revamping the old system isn't so bad.\n> Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation. Isn't any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot? The system is far from perfect, but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity.\n> \n> \n\n\nLater, on July 27, 2015, Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google+ account to post comments to YouTube.[174] On November 3, 2016, YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve, hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments.[175] Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam. They can also allow other users to moderate their comments.[176]\n\n\nIn December 2020, it was reported that YouTube would launch a new feature that will warn users who post a comment that \"may be offensive to others.\"[177][178]\n\n\n\n#### Community[edit]\n\n\nOn September 13, 2016, YouTube launched a public beta of Community, a social media-based feature that allows users to post text, images (including GIFs), live videos and others in a separate \"Community\" tab on their channel.[179] Prior to the release, several creators had been consulted to suggest tools Community could incorporate that they would find useful; these YouTubers included Vlogbrothers, AsapScience, Lilly Singh, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons, Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger and Vsauce3.[180][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nAfter the feature has been officially released, the *community post* feature gets activated automatically for every channel that passes a specific threshold of subscriber counts or already has more subscribers. This threshold was lowered over time,[*when?*] from 10,000 subscribers to 1500 subscribers, to 1000 subscribers,[181][*non-primary source needed*] to 500 subscribers.[182]\n\n\nChannels that the community tab becomes enabled for, get their channel discussions (previously known as channel comments) permanently erased, instead of co-existing or migrating.[183][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n#### TestTube[edit]\n\n\nExperimental features of YouTube can be accessed in an area of the site named *TestTube*.[184][185]\n\n\nFor example, in October 2009, a *comment search* feature accessible under `/comment_search` was implemented as part of this program. The feature was removed later.[186]\n\n\nLater the same year, *YouTube Feather* was introduced as a \"lightweight\" alternative website for countries with limited internet speeds.[187]\n\n\n\n### Content accessibility[edit]\n\n\nYouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web.[188] This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by, or related to another user's video can make a \"video response\". The eleven character YouTube video identifier (64 possible characters used in each position), allows for a theoretical maximum of 6411 or around 73.8 quintillion (73.8 billion billion) unique ids.\n\n\nYouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature on August 27, 2013.[189] Embedding, rating, commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner.[190] YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos, and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface.[191] A small number of videos can be downloaded as MP4 files.[192] Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos.[193]\n\n\nIn February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout.[194] In June 2012, Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos.[195] In response, Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site.[196] Users retain copyright of their own work under the default Standard YouTube License,[197] but have the option to grant certain usage rights under any public copyright license they choose.\n\n\nSince July 2012, it has been possible to select a Creative Commons attribution license as the default, allowing other users to reuse and remix the material.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Platforms[edit]\n\n\nMost modern smartphones are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video.[199] Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.[200]\n\n\nSince June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone.[201]\n\n\nThe mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 in July 2010, avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls.[202] The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform.[203][204]\n\n\nIn September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system.[205] According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third-most used app.[206]\n\n\nA TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos.[207]\n\n\nIn January 2009, YouTube launched \"YouTube for TV\", a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers, initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles.[208][209]\n\n\nDuring the month of June that same year, YouTube XL was introduced, which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen.[210] YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live.[211]\n\n\nOn November 15, 2012, Google launched an official app for the Wii, allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel.[212] An app was available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, but was discontinued in August 2019.[213] Videos can also be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5.[214][*non-primary source needed*] Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17, 2013,[215] and, in October 2014, the Sony PlayStation 4.[216]\n\n\nYouTube launched as a downloadable app for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018.[217]\n\n\n\n### International and localization[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt appeared in Paris to launch the new localization system.[218] The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 104 countries, one territory (Hong Kong) and a worldwide version.[219]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

chosen based on the IP address of the user. In some cases, the message \"This video is not available in your country\" may appear because of copyright restrictions or inappropriate content.[268] The interface of the YouTube website is available in 76 language versions, including Amharic, Albanian, Armenian, Burmese, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Persian and Uzbek, which do not have local channel versions. Access to YouTube was blocked in Turkey between 2008 and 2010, following controversy over the posting of videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and some material offensive to Muslims.[269][270] In October 2012, a local version of YouTube was launched in Turkey, with the domain `youtube.com.tr`. The local version is subject to the content regulations found in Turkish law.[271] In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British royalty collection agency PRS for Music led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach an agreement on a licensing deal. The dispute was resolved in September 2009.[272] In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany.[273]\n\n\n\n## Videos[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television.[274] In 2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by *The Daily Dot* that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. This was disputed by *Billboard*, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.[276][277] On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behaviour which caused a video's view count to freeze at \"301\" (later \"301+\") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.[278] YouTube view counts once again updated in real time.[279]\n\n\nSince September 2019, subscriber counts are abbreviated. Only three leading digits of channels' subscriber counts are indicated publicly, compromising the function of third-party real-time indicators such as that of Social Blade. Exact counts remain available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio.[280]\n\n\nOn November 11, 2021, after testing out this change in March of the same year, YouTube announced it would start hiding dislike counts on videos, making them invisible to viewers. The company stated the decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment. Creators will still be able to see the number of likes and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool, according to YouTube.[281][282][283]\n\n\n\n### Copyright issues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube copyright issues\n\nFurther information: § Revenue to copyright holders\n\nYouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns.[32] At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws.[284] Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted.[285][286] From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.[287][288][289]\n\n\nIn August 2008, a US court ruled in *Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.* that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material.[290] YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply.[291]\n\n\nIn the 2011 case of *Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC*, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube.[292] He asserted seven causes of action, and four were ruled in Smith's favor.[293] In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users.[294] On November 1, 2016, the dispute with GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA.[295]\n\n\nIn April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice.[296][297] As part of YouTube Music, Universal and YouTube signed an agreement in 2017, which was followed by separate agreements other major labels, which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube.[298] By 2019, creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video, with different levels of enforcement depending on the record label.[299] Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use.[299]\n\n\n\n#### Content ID[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Content ID (system)\n\nIn June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute.[300] The system, which was initially called \"Video Identification\"[301][302] and later became known as Content ID,[303] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[304] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.\n\n\nAn independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was \"surprisingly resilient\" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.[305] The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.[306] If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.[307]\n\n\nBefore 2016, videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved. Since April 2016, videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute.[308] Should the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the \"Video Manager\".[309] YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.[310]\n\n\n\n### Moderation and offensive content[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google § YouTube, and Censorship by Google § YouTube\n\nYouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site's features. The uploading of videos containing defamation, pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube's \"Community Guidelines\".[311][*better source needed*] Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content, videos of animal abuse, shock videos, content uploaded without the copyright holder's consent, hate speech, spam, and predatory behavior.[311] YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's guidelines.[311] Despite the guidelines, YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations,[312] its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods,[313] hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters,[314] videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections,[315] and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising.[312]\n\n\nYouTube contracts companies to hire content moderators, who view content flagged as potentially violating YouTube's content policies and determines if they should be removed. In September 2020, a class-action suit was filed by a former content moderator who reported developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after an 18-month period on the job. The former content moderator said that she was regularly made to exceed YouTube's stated limit of four hours per day of viewing graphic content. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube's contractors gave little to no training or support for its moderators' mental health, made prospective employees sign NDAs before showing them any examples of content they would see while reviewing, and censored all mention of trauma from its internal forums. It also purports that requests for extremely graphic content to be blurred, reduced in size or made monochrome, per recommendations from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, were rejected by YouTube as not a high priority for the company.[316][317][318]\n\n\nTo limit the spread of misinformation and fake news via YouTube, it has rolled out a comprehensive policy regarding how it plans to deal with technically manipulated videos.[319]\n\n\nControversial content has included material relating to Holocaust denial and the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in 1989.[320][321] In July 2008, the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was \"unimpressed\" with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that \"proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content\". YouTube responded by stating:\n\n\n\n\n> We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly.[322] (July 2008)\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2010, U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner urged YouTube to remove from its website videos of imam Anwar al-Awlaki.[323] YouTube pulled some of the videos in November 2010, stating they violated the site's guidelines.[324] In December 2010, YouTube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content.[325]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube introduced a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other fake news, filling the infobox with content from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech.[326][327] In the wake of the Notre-Dame fire on April 15, 2019, several user-uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by YouTube' system automatically with an Encyclopædia Britannica article on the false conspiracy theories around the September 11 attacks. Several users complained to YouTube about this inappropriate connection. YouTube officials apologized for this, stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically, and were taking steps to remedy this.[328]\n\n\nOn April 18, 2023, YouTube revealed its changes in handling content associated with eating disorders. This social media platform's Community Guidelines now prohibit content that could encourage emulation from at-risk users. This content includes behavior that shows severe calorie tracking and purging after eating. However, videos featuring positive behavior such as in the context of recovery will be permitted on the platform under two conditions—the user must have a registered (logged-in) account and must be older than 18.\nThis policy was created in collaboration with nonprofit organizations as well as the National Eating Disorder Association. Garth Graham, YouTube's Global Head of Healthcare revealed in an interview with CNN that this policy change was geared at ensuring that this video-sharing platform provides an avenue for \"community recovery and resources\" while ensuring continued viewer protection.[329]\n\n\n\n#### Homophobia and transphobia[edit]\n\n\nFive leading content creators whose channels were based on LGBTQ+ materials filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube in August 2019, alleging that YouTube's algorithms divert discovery away from their channels, impacting their revenue. The plaintiffs claimed that the algorithms discourage content with words like \"lesbian\" or \"gay\", which would be predominant in their channels' content, and because of YouTube's near-monopolization of online video services, they are abusing that position.[330]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Media Matters, a media watchdog group, reported that homophobic and transphobic content calling LGBT people \"predators\" and \"groomers\" was becoming more common on YouTube.[331] The report also referred to common accusations in YouTube videos that LGBT people are mentally ill.[331] The report stated the content appeared to be in violation of YouTube's hate speech policy.[331]\n\n\n\n#### Animal torture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(July 2023)*\n |\n\n\nYouTube said animal abuse \"has no place on their platforms, and they are working to remove content\".[332][333][334][335][336][337]\n\n\n\n#### YouTube as a tool to promote conspiracy theories and far-right content[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been criticized for using an algorithm that gives great prominence to videos that promote conspiracy theories, falsehoods and incendiary fringe discourse.[338][339][340] According to an investigation by *The Wall Street Journal*, \"YouTube's recommendations often lead users to channels that feature conspiracy theories, partisan viewpoints and misleading videos, even when those users haven't shown interest in such content. When users show a political bias in what they choose to view, YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases, often with more-extreme viewpoints.\"[338][341] When users search for political or scientific terms, YouTube's search algorithms often give prominence to hoaxes and conspiracy theories.[340][342] After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking-news queries during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources.[338][343][344][345] In 2018, it was reported that YouTube was again promoting fringe content about breaking news, giving great prominence to conspiracy videos about Anthony Bourdain's death.[346]\n\n\nIn 2017, it was revealed that advertisements were being placed on extremist videos, including videos by rape apologists, anti-Semites, and hate preachers who received ad payouts.[347] After firms started to stop advertising on YouTube in the wake of this reporting, YouTube apologized and said that it would give firms greater control over where ads got placed.[347]\n\n\nAlex Jones, known for right-wing conspiracy theories, had built a massive audience on YouTube.[348] YouTube drew criticism in 2018 when it removed a video from Media Matters compiling offensive statements made by Jones, stating that it violated its policies on \"harassment and bullying\".[349] On August 6, 2018, however, YouTube removed Alex Jones' YouTube page following a content violation.[350]\n\n\nUniversity of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has referred to YouTube as \"The Great Radicalizer\", saying \"YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.\"[351] Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University described YouTube as a \"conspiracy ecosystem\".[340][352]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube said that it had introduced a new policy starting in the United States intended to stop recommending videos containing \"content that could misinform users in harmful ways.\" YouTube gave flat earth theories, miracle cures, and 9/11 trutherism as examples.[353] Efforts within YouTube engineering to stop recommending borderline extremist videos falling just short of forbidden hate speech, and track their popularity were originally rejected because they could interfere with viewer engagement.[354] In late 2019, the site began implementing measures directed towards \"raising authoritative content and reducing borderline content and harmful misinformation.\"[355]\n\n\nMultiple research studies have investigated cases of misinformation in YouTube. In a July 2019 study based on ten YouTube searches using the Tor Browser related to climate and climate change, the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change.[356] A May 2023 study found that YouTube was monetizing and profiting from videos that included misinformation about climate change.[357] A 2019 BBC investigation of YouTube searches in ten different languages found that YouTube's algorithm promoted health misinformation, including fake cancer cures.[358] In Brazil, YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters, as well as elevated far-right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories.[359] In the Philippines, numerous channels disseminated misinformation related to the 2022 Philippine elections.[360] Additionally, research on the dissemination of Flat Earth beliefs in social media, has shown that networks of YouTube channels form an echo chamber that polarizes audiences by appearing to confirm preexisting beliefs.[361]\n\n\n\n#### Use among white supremacists[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2019, YouTube took steps to remove specific videos or channels related to supremacist content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site-wide policies against hate speech.[362]\n\n\nIn the wake of the March 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks, YouTube and other sites like Facebook and Twitter that allowed user-submitted content drew criticism for doing little to moderate and control the spread of hate speech, which was considered to be a factor in the rationale for the attacks.[363][364] These platforms were pressured to remove such content, but in an interview with *The New York Times*, YouTube's chief product officer Neal Mohan said that unlike content such as ISIS videos which take a particular format and thus easy to detect through computer-aided algorithms, general hate speech was more difficult to recognize and handle, and thus could not readily take action to remove without human interaction.[365]\n\n\nYouTube joined an initiative led by France and New Zealand with other countries and tech companies in May 2019 to develop tools to be used to block online hate speech and to develop regulations, to be implemented at the national level, to be levied against technology firms that failed to take steps to remove such speech, though the United States declined to participate.[366][367] Subsequently, on June 5, 2019, YouTube announced a major change to its terms of service, \"specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.\" YouTube identified specific examples of such videos as those that \"promote or glorify Nazi ideology, which is inherently discriminatory\". YouTube further stated it would \"remove content denying that well-documented violent events, like the Holocaust or the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, took place.\"[362][368]\n\n\nIn October 2019, YouTube banned the main channel of Red Ice, a white supremacist multimedia company, for hate speech violations. The channel had about 330,000 subscribers. Lana Lokteff and Red Ice promoted a backup channel in an attempt to circumvent the ban.[369][370] A week later, the backup channel was also removed by YouTube.[371][372]\n\n\nIn June 2020, YouTube banned several channels associated with white supremacy, including those of Stefan Molyneux, David Duke, and Richard B. Spencer, asserting these channels violated their policies on hate speech. The ban occurred the same day that Reddit announced the ban on several hate speech sub-forums including r/The Donald.[373]\n\n\n\n#### Handling of COVID-19 pandemic and other misinformation[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the dissemination via YouTube of misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic that 5G communications technology was responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 which led to multiple 5G towers in the United Kingdom being attacked by arsonists, YouTube removed all such videos linking 5G and the coronavirus in this manner.[374]\n\n\nYouTube extended this policy in September 2021 to cover videos disseminating misinformation related to any vaccine, including those long approved against measles or Hepatitis B, that had received approval from local health authorities or the World Health Organization.[375][376] The platform removed the accounts of anti-vaccine campaigners such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Joseph Mercola at this time.[376] Two accounts linked to RT Deutsch, the German channel of the Russian RT network were removed as well for breaching YouTube's policies.[375]\n\n\nYouTube had extended this moderation to non-medical areas. In the weeks following the 2020 United States presidential election, the site added policies to remove or label videos promoting disproving election fraud claims;[377] however, it reversed this policy in June 2023, citing that the removal was necessary to \"openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial or based on disproven assumptions\".[378] Google and YouTube implemented policies in October 2021 to deny monetization or revenue to advertisers or content creators that promoted climate change denial, which \"includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.\"[379]\n\n\nIn July 2022 YouTube announced policies to combat misinformation surrounding abortion, such as videos with instructions to perform abortion methods that are considered unsafe and videos that contain misinformation about the safety of abortion.[380]\n\n\n\n#### Child safety and wellbeing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FamilyOFive, Fantastic Adventures scandal, and Elsagate\n\nLeading into 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children, coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family's activities, and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family-friendly material. In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90%.[381][382] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety. During Q2 2017, the owners of popular channel FamilyOFive, which featured themselves playing \"pranks\" on their children, were accused of child abuse. Their videos were eventually deleted, and two of their children were removed from their custody.[383][384][385][386] A similar case happened in 2019 when the owner of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children. Her videos would later be deleted.[387]\n\n\nLater that year, YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent, sexual or otherwise disturbing situations, many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views. The term \"Elsagate\" was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy.[388][389][390][391] On November 11, 2017, YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content. Later that month, the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family-friendly characters. As part of a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube, the wave of deletions also targeted channels that showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults. Most notably, the company removed *Toy Freaks*, a channel with over 8.5 million subscribers, that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations.[392][393][394][395][396] According to analytics specialist SocialBlade, it earned up to £8.7 million annually prior to its deletion.[397]\n\n\nEven for content that appears to be aimed at children and appears to contain only child-friendly content, YouTube's system allows for anonymity of who uploads these videos. These questions have been raised in the past, as YouTube has had to remove channels with children's content which, after becoming popular, then suddenly include inappropriate content masked as children's content.[398] Alternative, some of the most-watched children's programming on YouTube comes from channels that have no identifiable owners, raising concerns of intent and purpose. One channel that had been of concern was \"Cocomelon\" which provided numerous mass-produced animated videos aimed at children. Up through 2019, it had drawn up to US$10 million a month in ad revenue and was one of the largest kid-friendly channels on YouTube before 2020. Ownership of Cocomelon was unclear outside of its ties to \"Treasure Studio\", itself an unknown entity, raising questions as to the channel's purpose,[398][399][400] but *Bloomberg News* had been able to confirm and interview the small team of American owners in February 2020 regarding \"Cocomelon\", who stated their goal for the channel was to simply entertain children, wanting to keep to themselves to avoid attention from outside investors.[401] The anonymity of such channel raise concerns because of the lack of knowledge of what purpose they are trying to serve.[402] The difficulty to identify who operates these channels \"adds to the lack of accountability\", according to Josh Golin of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, and educational consultant Renée Chernow-O'Leary found the videos were designed to entertain with no intent to educate, all leading to critics and parents to be concerned for their children becoming too enraptured by the content from these channels.[398] Content creators that earnestly make child-friendly videos have found it difficult to compete with larger channels, unable to produce content at the same rate as them, and lacking the same means of being promoted through YouTube's recommendation algorithms that the larger animated channel networks have shared.[402]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube officially banned videos containing \"challenges that encourage acts that have an inherent risk of severe physical harm\" (such as the Tide Pod Challenge) and videos featuring pranks that \"make victims believe they're in physical danger\" or cause emotional distress in children.[403]\n\n\n\n##### Sexualization of children and pedophilia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Elsagate\n\nAlso in November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children—often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics—were attracting comments from pedophiles[404][405] with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian.[405] Other child-centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web, and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles.[406]\n\n\nAs a result of the controversy, which added to the concern about \"Elsagate\", several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube.[391][407] In December 2018, *The Times* found more than 100 grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior (such as taking off clothes, adopting overtly sexual poses and touching other children inappropriately) by strangers.[408] After a reporter flagged the videos in question, half of them were removed, and the rest were removed after *The Times* contacted YouTube's PR department.[408]\n\n\nIn February 2019, YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a \"wormhole\" that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content, and make all of that user's recommended content feature only these types of videos.[409] Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions or otherwise making indecent remarks. In some cases, other users had re-uploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos, and then monetized these, propagating this network.[410] In the wake of the controversy, the service reported that they had deleted over 400 channels and tens of millions of comments, and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A spokesperson explained that \"any content—including comments—that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.\"[411][412] Despite these measures, AT&T, Disney, Dr. Oetker, Epic Games, and Nestlé all pulled their advertising from YouTube.[410][413]\n\n\nSubsequently, YouTube began to demonetize and block advertising on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments. The service explained that this was a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem.[414] YouTube also began to flag channels that predominantly feature children, and preemptively disable their comments sections. \"Trusted partners\" can request that comments be re-enabled, but the channel will then become responsible for moderating comments. These actions mainly target videos of toddlers, but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual, such as gymnastics. YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators.[415][416]\n\n\nA related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string \"CP\" (an abbreviation of child pornography) resulted in some prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation, including videos related to the mobile video game *Pokémon Go* (which uses \"CP\" as an abbreviation of the statistic \"Combat Power\"), and *Club Penguin*. YouTube apologized for the errors and reinstated the affected videos.[417] Separately, online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said; this activity became an issue during the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in early 2019. YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity.[418]\n\n\nIn June 2019, *The New York Times* cited researchers who found that users who watched erotic videos could be recommended seemingly innocuous videos of children.[419] As a result, Senator Josh Hawley stated plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban YouTube and other video sharing sites from including videos that predominantly feature minors as \"recommended\" videos, excluding those that were \"professionally produced\", such as videos of televised talent shows.[420] YouTube has suggested potential plans to remove all videos featuring children from the main YouTube site and transferring them to the YouTube Kids site where they would have stronger controls over the recommendation system, as well as other major changes on the main YouTube site to the recommended feature and autoplay system.[421]\n\n\n\n#### Misogyny[edit]\n\n\nA January 2022 report by the social media analytics firm Bot Sentinel said that several online influencers were using YouTube to exclusively post negative content about Prince Harry and Meghan, including conspiracy theories about the couple, in what it called \"a lucrative hate-for-profit enterprise\" where \"racism and YouTube ad revenue are the primary motivators.\" Bot Sentinel also found that one of the most prominent accounts promoting a conspiracy theory that Meghan was never pregnant had accumulated nearly 19 million views and was earning around $44,000 a year. YouTube banned the account in March.[422]\n\n\nAn August 2022 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a British think tank, found that harassment against women was flourishing on YouTube. It noted that channels espousing a similar ideology to that of men's rights influencer Andrew Tate were using YouTube to grow their audience, despite Tate being banned from the platform.[423] In his 2022 book *Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise to World Domination*, Bloomberg reporter Mark Bergen said that many female content creators were dealing with harassment, bullying and stalking.[423]\n\n\n\n### April Fools gags[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Google April Fools' Day jokes\n\nYouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016. In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a prank known as \"rickrolling\".[424][425] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a \"new layout\".[426] In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a \"TEXTp\" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters \"in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.\"[427]\n\n\nThe next year, the site celebrated its \"100th anniversary\" with a range of sepia-toned silent, early 1900s-style films, including a parody of Keyboard Cat.[428] In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on DVD.[429]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company *The Onion* to claim in an uploaded video that the video-sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.[430][431]\n\n\nIn 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as \"Clocking\", \"Kissing Dad\", and \"Glub Glub Water Dance\".[432] The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from \"Sandstorm\" by Darude.[433] In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.[434]\n\n\n\n## Services[edit]\n\n\n### YouTube Premium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Premium\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Premium\nYouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers advertising-free streaming, access to original programming, and background and offline video playback on mobile devices.[435] YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as \"Music Key\", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music \"All Access\" service.[436][437][438] On October 28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos and access to exclusive original content.[439][440][441] As of November 2016[update], the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis.[442] As of June 2017[update], the first season of YouTube Originals had gotten 250 million views in total.[443]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Kids[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Kids\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Kids\nYouTube Kids is an American children's video app developed by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google. The app was developed in response to parental and government scrutiny on the content available to children. The app provides a version of the service-oriented towards children, with curated selections of content, parental control features, and filtering of videos deemed inappropriate viewing for children aged under 13, 8 or 5 depending on the age grouping chosen. First released on February 15, 2015, as an Android and iOS mobile app, the app has since been released for LG, Samsung, and Sony smart TVs, as well as for Android TV. On May 27, 2020, it became available on Apple TV. As of September 2019, the app is available in 69 countries, including Hong Kong and Macau, and one province. YouTube launched a web-based version of YouTube Kids on August 30, 2019.\n\n\n\n### YouTube Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Music\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Music\nOn September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the co-founder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music Group executive, the Global Head of Music.[444]\n\n\nIn early 2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a platform that would compete with other services such as Spotify and Apple Music.[445] On May 22, 2018, the music streaming platform named \"YouTube Music\" was launched.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Movies[edit]\n\n\nYouTube Movies is a service by YouTube that shows movies via its website. Around 100–500 movies are free to view, with ads. Some new movies get added and some get removed, unannounced at a new month.[448]\n\n\n\n### YouTube TV[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube TV\n\n![](image)YouTube TV logo\nOn February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$65 per month. Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017,[449][450] the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC), as well as approximately 40 cable channels owned by the corporate parents of those networks, The Walt Disney Company, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal and Turner Broadcasting System (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN). Subscribers can also receive Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Premium original content.[451][452]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Go[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Go\nIn September 2016, *YouTube Go* was announced,[453] as an Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets. It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users. It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution.[454]\n\n\nIn February 2017, *YouTube Go* was launched in India, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South Africa.[455][456] On February 1, 2018, it was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq. Before it shut down, the app was available to around 60% of the world's population.[457][458] In May 2022, Google announced that they would be shutting down *YouTube Go* in August 2022.[459]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Shorts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Shorts\n\nAn example video that is suitable for YouTube Shorts, showing Crew Dragon *Endeavour* docking at the International Space Station\nIn September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts.[460][461] The platform was first tested in India but as of March 2021 has expanded to other countries including the United States with videos now able to be up to 1 minute long.[462] The platform is not a standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app. Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools, including the possibility of adding licensed music to their videos.[463] The platform had its global beta launch in July 2021.[464]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Stories[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube started testing a new feature initially called \"YouTube Reels\".[465] The feature is nearly identical to Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories. YouTube later renamed the feature \"YouTube Stories\". It is only available to creators who have more than 10,000 subscribers and can only be posted/seen in the YouTube mobile app.[466] On May 25, 2023, YouTube announced that it would be shutting down this feature on June 26, 2023.[467][468]\n\n\n\n## Social impact[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social impact of YouTube\n\nPrivate individuals[469] and large production corporations[470] have used YouTube to grow their audiences. Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic.[469] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television.[470] While YouTube's revenue-sharing \"Partner Program\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually[471] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million[472]—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \"a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels.\"[473] In 2013 *Forbes*' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.[474] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \"mega\", \"mainstream\" and \"mid-sized\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year.[475] By early 2013, *Billboard* had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the *Billboard* Hot 100 and related genre charts.[476]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan Hoffner at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards accepting for YouTube\nObserving that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been \"fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution\", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that \"what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication.\"[477] Anderson asserted that it is not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch \"the biggest learning cycle in human history.\"[477] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what *Forbes'* Michael Noer called \"the largest school in the world,\" with technology poised to disrupt how people learn.[478] YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award,[479] the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that \"both embodies and promotes democracy.\"[480] *The Washington Post* reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white.[481] A Pew Research Center study reported the development of \"visual journalism\", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation.[482] The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.[483]\n\n\nYouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape.[484] Describing the Arab Spring (2010–2012), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using \"Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.\"[485] In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the \"Kony 2012\" video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video \"will do more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined.\"[486]\n\n\n\n![](image)Leading YouTube content creators met at the White House with U.S. President Obama to discuss how government could better connect with the \"YouTube generation.\"[487][488]\nConversely, YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012[489] and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance.[490] In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare[491] but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the \"YouTube Generation.\"[487] Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.[487]\n\n\nSome YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as *Innocence of Muslims* (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.[492] TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.[477] Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in *The New York Times* that such videos have \"surprising implications\" for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.[493]\n\n\nA 2017 article in *The New York Times Magazine* posited that YouTube had become \"the new talk radio\" for the far right.[494] Almost a year before YouTube's January 2019 announcement that it would begin a \"gradual change\" of \"reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways\",[495] Zeynep Tufekci had written in *The New York Times* that, \"(g)iven its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century\".[496] Under YouTube's changes to its recommendation engine, the most recommended channel evolved from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (2016) to Fox News (2019).[497] According to a 2020 study, \"An emerging journalistic consensus theorizes the central role played by the video 'recommendation engine,' but we believe that this is premature. Instead, we propose the 'Supply and Demand' framework for analyzing politics on YouTube.\"[498] A 2022 study found that \"despite widespread concerns that YouTube's algorithms send people down 'rabbit holes' with recommendations to extremist videos, little systematic evidence exists to support this conjecture\", \"exposure to alternative and extremist channel videos on YouTube is heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment.\", and \"contrary to the 'rabbit holes' narrative, non-subscribers are rarely recommended videos from alternative and extremist channels and seldom follow such recommendations when offered.\"[499]\n\n\n*The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers*[500] and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra[501] selected their membership based on individual video performances.[477][501] Further, the cybercollaboration charity video \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)\" was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work,[502] with *The Tokyo Times* noting the \"We Pray for You\" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.[503]\nThe anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens,[504] that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet secretaries.[505] Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video \"My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm,\" legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy.[506] In May 2018, after London Metropolitan Police claimed that drill music videos glamorizing violence gave rise to gang violence, YouTube deleted 30 videos.[507]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nPrior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as \"not material\" in a regulatory filing.[508] In June 2008, a *Forbes* magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.[509] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion.[510] In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to eMarketer,[510][511] while others estimated $4.7 billion.[510] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising.[62] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month.[512] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.[62]\n\n\nGoogle first published exact revenue numbers for YouTube in February 2020 as part of Alphabet's 2019 financial report. According to Google, YouTube had made US$15.1 billion in ad revenue in 2019, in contrast to US$8.1 billion in 2017 and US$11.1 billion in 2018. YouTube's revenues made up nearly 10% of the total Alphabet revenue in 2019.[513][514] These revenues accounted for approximately 20 million subscribers combined between YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions, and 2 million subscribers to YouTube TV.[515]\n\n\nYouTube had $19.8 billion in revenue in 2020.[516]\n\n\n\n### Partnership with corporations[edit]\n\n\nYouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[517] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment.[518] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called \"Shows\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[519][520] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[521] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service,[522] which is only available to users in the United States, Canada, and the UK as of 2010.[523][524][*needs update*] The service offers over 6,000 films.[525]\n\n\n\n#### 2017 advertiser boycott[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would \"be delivered safely and appropriately\". *The Guardian* newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had \"begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear\".[526][527] In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a *Wall Street Journal* article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.[528][529]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2017, YouTube announced that to \"ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules\", it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000-lifetime views, before they may join the Partner Program.[530]\n\n\n\n### YouTuber earnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Total annual earnings of the top ten YouTuber accounts, and the income of the single highest-earning account.\nIn May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site.[531] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.[532][533]\n\n\nThere are over two million members of the YouTube Partner Program.[534] According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually, no more than half of the eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.[535]\n\n\nYouTube's policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising, including videos containing violence, strong language, sexual content, \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\" (unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\"),[536] and videos whose user comments contain \"inappropriate\" content.[537]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos.[538][539] In April 2017, YouTube set an eligibility requirement of 10,000 lifetime views for a paid subscription.[540] On January 16, 2018, the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to 4,000 hours of watch-time within the past 12 months and 1,000 subscribers.[540] The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to controversy, but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels.[541]\n\n\nYouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.[542] The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal, ruby, and red tinted crystal glass are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million, fifty million subscribers, and one hundred million subscribers, respectively.[543][544]\n\n\nYouTube's policies on \"advertiser-friendly content\" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized; this includes strong violence, language,[545] sexual content, and \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\", unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\".[546] In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent users, including Phillip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was \"censorship by a different name\". A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new, the service had \"improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators\".[547][548][549] *Boing Boing* reported in 2019 that LGBT keywords resulted in demonetization.[550]\n\n\nAs of November 2020 in the United States and June 2021 worldwide,[551] YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform, even if their uploader is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program. This will occur on channels whose content is deemed \"advertiser-friendly\", and all revenue will go directly to Google without any share given to the uploader.[552]\n\n\n\n### Revenue to copyright holders[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: § Copyrighted material\n\nThe majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue.[553] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders. YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue.[554] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games.[555] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program.[556][557][558] On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program. Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019.[559][560]\n\n\n\n## Censorship and bans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Censorship of YouTube\n\n![](image)Availability of YouTube as of January 2021:  \n Has local YouTube version\n Accessible (Worldwide version)\n Currently blocked\n Previously blocked\n\nYouTube has been censored, filtered, or banned for a variety of reasons, including:[561]\n\n\n\n* Limiting public access and exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest.\n* Preventing criticism of a ruler (e.g. in North Korea), government (e.g. in China) or its actions (e.g. in Morocco), government officials (e.g. in Turkey and Libya), or religion (e.g. in Pakistan).\n* Morality-based laws, e.g. in Iran.\n\n\nAccess to specific videos is sometimes prevented due to copyright and intellectual property protection laws (e.g. in Germany), violations of hate speech, and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate for youth,[562] which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with \"restricted mode\".[563] Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to its bandwidth limitations[564][565] and the site's potential for distraction.[561][566]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], public access to YouTube is blocked in many countries, including China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan,[567] Uzbekistan,[568][569] Tajikistan, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. In some countries, YouTube is blocked for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.[561]\n\n\nReports emerged that since October 2019, comments posted with Chinese characters insulting the Chinese Communist Party (共匪 or \"communist bandit\") or (五毛 or \"50 Cent Party\", referring to state-sponsored commentators) were being automatically deleted within 15 seconds.[570]\n\n\nSpecific incidents where YouTube has been blocked include:\n\n\n\n* Thailand blocked access in April 2007 over a video said to be insulting the Thai king.[571]\n* Morocco blocked access in May 2007, possibly as a result of videos critical of Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara.[572] YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007, after *Maroc Telecom* unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere \"technical glitch\".[573]\n* Turkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.[574][575][576] In November 2010, a video of the Turkish politician Deniz Baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly, and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video.[577] During the two and a half-year block of YouTube, the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed site in Turkey.[578][579] In 2014, Turkey blocked the access for the second time, after \"a high-level intelligence leak.\"[580][581][582]\n* Pakistan blocked access on February 23, 2008, because of \"offensive material\" towards the Islamic faith, including display of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.[583] This led to a near global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours, as the Pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries. On February 26, 2008, the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government.[584][585] Many Pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private network software.[586] In May 2010, following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube, citing \"growing sacrilegious content\".[587] The ban was lifted on May 27, 2010, after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government. However, individual videos deemed offensive to Muslims posted on YouTube will continue to be blocked.[588][589] Pakistan again placed a ban on YouTube in September 2012, after the site refused to remove the film *Innocence of Muslims*. The ban was lifted in January 2016 after YouTube launched a Pakistan-specific version.[590]\n* Libya blocked access on January 24, 2010, because of videos that featured demonstrations in the city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch.[591] In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.[592]\n* Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sudan blocked access in September 2012 following controversy over a 14-minute trailer for the film *Innocence of Muslims* which had been posted on the site.[593][594][595][596][597] A court in the southern Russian Republic of Chechnya ruled that *Innocence of Muslims* should be banned.[598] In Libya and Egypt, it was blamed for violent protests. YouTube stated: \"This video—which is widely available on the Web—is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries.\"[599][600]\n* Russia threatened to ban YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021.[601] Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube announced on March 1 the immediate removal of RT (and other Russian-government funded outlets) from its platform in Europe.[602]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Invidious, a free and open-source alternative frontend to YouTube\n* Alternative media\n* BookTube\n* BreadTube\n* CNN/YouTube presidential debates\n* Lists\n\t+ Comparison of video hosting services\n\t+ List of Google Easter eggs#YouTube\n\t+ List of Internet phenomena\n\t+ List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-liked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n\t+ List of online video platforms\n\t+ List of YouTubers\n* Lawsuits\n\t+ *Viacom International Inc. v.

Accessible worldwide,[7] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website in the world, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users,[8] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos every day.[9] As of May 2019[update], videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[10][11]\n\n\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[12] Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a greater audience.\n\n\nYouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite its growth and success, it has been widely criticized for allegedly facilitating the spread of misinformation and the sharing of copyrighted content, routinely violating its users' privacy, enabling censorship, endangering child safety and wellbeing, and for its inconsistent or incorrect implementation of platform guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of YouTube\n\n### Founding and initial growth (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, the founders of YouTube.\nYouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay.[14] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[15]\n\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[16]\n\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[17] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[16][18] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[19] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)The YouTube logo used from its launch until 2007;[*citation needed*] it returned in 2008 before being removed again in 2010.[*citation needed*] Another version of this logo without the \"Broadcast Yourself\" slogan was used until 2011.\nYouTube began as a venture capital–funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two.[14][21] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[22] In February 2005, the company activated `www.youtube.com`.[23] The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\nYouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was launched in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor.[31] The week of YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's *Saturday Night Live* ran a skit \"Lazy Sunday\" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for *Saturday Night Live*, \"Lazy Sunday\"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website.[32] Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns.[33] Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content.[34][35] The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[36]\n\n\nThe choice of the name `www.youtube.com` led to problems for a similarly named website, `www.utube.com`. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to `www.utubeonline.com`.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast Yourself era (2006–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California\nOn October 9, 2006, Google announced that it had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock.[39][40] The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[41][42] Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube.[31] It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself\".\nThe company experienced rapid growth. *The Daily Telegraph* wrote that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000.[43] By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos, according to comScore.[44] That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site.[45] In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every minute.[46][47][48] However, most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[49] That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red.[50][51] A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013.[52] By that point, more than 100 hours were being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014.[53][54]\n\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo from 2015 until 2017\nDuring this time, the company also went through some organizational changes. In October 2006, YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno, California.[55] Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as a chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company in October 2010.[56]\n\n\nIn December 2009, YouTube partnered with Vevo.[57] In April 2010, Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" became the most viewed video, becoming the first video to reach 200 million views on May 9, 2010.[58]\n\n\n\n### Susan Wojcicki and going mainstream (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo since 2017\nSusan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014.[59] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million. The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees.[60] YouTube officially launched the \"polymer\" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017.[61]\n\n\nThrough this period, YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond advertisements. In 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium, subscription-based channels.[62][63] This effort was discontinued in January 2018 and relaunched in June, with US$4.99 channel subscriptions.[64][65] These channel subscriptions complemented the existing Super Chat ability, launched in 2017, which allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment highlighted.[66] In 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as \"Music Key,\" which bundled ad-free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[67] The service continued to evolve in 2015 when YouTube announced YouTube Red, a new premium service that would offer ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year), premium original series, and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform.[68][69][70]\n\n\nThe company also attempted to create products appealing to specific viewers. YouTube released a mobile app known as YouTube Kids in 2015, designed to provide an experience optimized for children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control features.[71] Also in 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[72]\n\n\nThe company was attacked on April 3, 2018, when a shooting occurred at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California, which wounded four and resulted in the death of the shooter.[73]\n\n\n\n### Recent history (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\nBy February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute.[9][74] Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than 500 hours per minute.[10] During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-at-home orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased. One data firm[*which?*] estimated that YouTube was accounting for 15% of all internet traffic, twice its pre-pandemic level.[75] In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix stated they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's request.[76] YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.\"[77]\n\n\nFollowing a 2018 complaint alleging violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),[78] the company was fined $170 million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of 13.[79] YouTube was also ordered to create systems to increase children's privacy.[80][81] Following criticisms of its implementation of those systems, YouTube started treating all videos designated as \"made for kids\" as liable under COPPA on January 6, 2020.[82][83] Joining the YouTube Kids app, the company created a supervised mode, designed more for tweens, in 2021.[84] Additionally, to compete with TikTok, YouTube released YouTube Shorts, a short-form video platform.\n\n\nDuring this period, YouTube entered disputes with other tech companies. For over a year, in 2018 and 2019, no YouTube app was available for Amazon Fire products.[85] In 2020, Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement.[86]\n\n\nAfter testing earlier in 2021, YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November 2021, claiming the reason for the removal was, based on its internal research, that users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading.[87] While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls, others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as \"a stupid idea\", and that the real reason behind the change was \"not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed.\" He felt that users' ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential, saying, \"The process works, and there's a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines.\"[88][89][90] Shortly after the announcement, software developer Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike, an open-source, third-party browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video's number of dislikes.[91] In a letter published on January 25, 2022, by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, acknowledged that removing public dislike counts was a controversial decision, but reiterated that she stands by this decision, claiming that \"it reduced dislike attacks.\"[92]\n\n\nIn 2022, YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts, intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video. Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads, YouTube \"ended\" the experiment on September 19 of that year.[93] In October, YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles (e.g. @MrBeast6000) in addition to channel names, which would also become channel URLs.[94]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor. Wojcicki will take on an advisory role for Google and parent company Alphabet.[95]\n\n\nIn late October 2023, YouTube began cracking down on the use of ad blockers on the platform. Users of ad blockers may be given a pop-up warning saying \"Video player will be blocked after 3 videos\". Users of ad blockers are shown a message inviting them to subscribe to YouTube Premium. YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service.[96][97]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and held the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023.[95] The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023.[95]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Video technology[edit]\n\n\nYouTube primarily uses the VP9 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video codecs, and the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP protocol.[98] MPEG-4 Part 2 streams contained within 3GP containers are also provided for low bandwidth connections.[99] By January 2019, YouTube had begun rolling out videos in AV1 format.[100] In 2021 it was reported that the company was considering requiring AV1 in streaming hardware in order to decrease bandwidth and increase quality.[101] Video is usually streamed alongside the Opus and AAC audio codecs.[99]\n\n\nAt launch in 2005, viewing YouTube videos on a personal computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to be installed in the browser.[102] In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of Web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard.[103] This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed.[104] On January 27, 2015, YouTube announced that HTML5 would be the default playback method on supported browsers.[103] HTML5 video streams use Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), an HTTP-based adaptive bit-rate streaming solution optimizes the bitrate and quality for the available network.[105]\n\n\nThe platform can serve videos at optionally lower resolution levels starting at 144p for smoothening playback in areas and countries with limited Internet speeds, improving compatibility, as well as for the preservation of limited cellular data plans. The resolution can be adjusted automatically based on detected connection speed or set manually.[106][107]\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2017, users could add \"annotations\" to their videos, such as pop-up text messages and hyperlinks, which allowed for interactive videos. By 2019 all annotations had been removed from videos, breaking some videos that depended on the feature. YouTube introduced standardized widgets intended to replace annotations in a cross-platform manner, including \"end screens\" (a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video).[108][109][110]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube became an International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) registry, and announced its intention to begin creating ISNI identifiers to uniquely identify the musicians whose videos it features.[111]\n\n\nUsers can verify their account, normally through a mobile phone, to gain the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as produce live streams.[112][113] Users who have built sufficient channel history and have a good track record of complying with the site's Community Guidelines will also gain access to these aforementioned features as well.[114] When YouTube was launched in 2005, it was possible to upload longer videos, but a 10-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films.[115] The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010.[116] Videos can be at most 256 GB in size or 12 hours, whichever is less.[112] As of 2021[update], automatic closed captions using speech recognition technology when a video is uploaded are available in 13 languages, and can be machine-translated during playback.[117]\n\n\nYouTube also offers manual closed captioning as part of its creator studio.[118] YouTube formerly offered a 'Community Captions' feature, where viewers could write and submit captions for public display upon approval by the video uploader, but this was deprecated in September 2020.[119]\n\n\nYouTube accepts the most common container formats, including MP4, Matroska, FLV, AVI, WebM, 3GP, MPEG-PS, and the QuickTime File Format. Some intermediate video formats (i.e., primarily used for professional video editing, not for final delivery or storage) are also accepted, such as ProRes.[120] YouTube provides recommended encoding settings.[121]\n\n\nEach video is identified by an eleven-character case-sensitive alphanumerical Base64 string in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which can contain letters, digits, an underscore (`_`), and a dash (`-`).[122]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube added a feature called *Premiere* which displays a notification to the user mentioning when the video will be available for the first time, like for a live stream but with a prerecorded video. When the scheduled time arrives, the video is aired as a live broadcast with a two-minute countdown. Optionally, a premiere can be initiated immediately.[123]\n\n\n\n#### Quality and formats[edit]\n\n\nYouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320×240 pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec (a variant of H.263),[124][125] with mono MP3 audio.[126] In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3GP format on mobile phones.[127] In March 2008, a high-quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480×360 pixels.[128] In December 2008, 720p HD support was added. At the time of the 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9.[129] With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format. In November 2009, 1080p HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels.[130][131] In July 2010, support for 4K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 3840 × 2160 pixels.[132] In June 2015, support for 8K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels.[133] In November 2016, support for HDR video was added which can be encoded with hybrid log–gamma (HLG) or perceptual quantizer (PQ).[134] HDR video can be encoded with the Rec. 2020 color space.[135]\n\n\nIn June 2014, YouTube began to deploy support for high frame rate videos up to 60 frames per second (as opposed to 30 before), becoming available for user uploads in October. YouTube stated that this would enhance \"motion-intensive\" videos, such as video game footage.[136][137][138][139]\n\n\nYouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. Viewers only indirectly influence the video quality. In the mobile apps, users choose between \"Auto\", which adjusts resolution based on the internet connection, \"High Picture Quality\" which will prioritize playing high-quality video, \"Data saver\" which will sacrifice video quality in favor of low data usage and \"Advanced\" which lets the user choose a stream resolution.[140] On desktop, users choose between \"Auto\" and a specific resolution.[141] It is not possible for the viewer to directly choose a higher bitrate (quality) for any selected resolution.\n\n\nSince 2009, viewers have had the ability to watch 3D videos.[142] In 2015, YouTube began natively supporting 360-degree video. Since April 2016, it allowed live streaming 360° video, and both normal and 360° video at up to 1440p, and since November 2016 both at up to 4K (2160p) resolution.[143][144][145] Citing the limited number of users who watched more than 90-degrees, it began supporting an alternative stereoscopic video format known as VR180 which it said was easier to produce,[146] which allows users to watch any video using virtual reality headsets.[147]\n\n\nIn response to increased viewership during the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube temporarily downgraded the quality of its videos.[148][149] YouTube developed its own chip, called Argos, to help with encoding higher resolution videos in 2021.[150]\n\n\nIn certain cases, YouTube allows the uploader to upgrade the quality of videos uploaded a long time ago in poor quality. One such partnership with Universal Music Group included remasters of 1,000 music videos.[151]\n\n\n\n#### Live streaming[edit]\n\n\nYouTube carried out early experiments with live streaming, including its YouTube Live event in 2008,[152] a concert by U2 in 2009, and a question-and-answer session with US President Barack Obama in February 2010.[153] These tests had relied on technology from 3rd-party partners, but in September 2010, YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure.[154] In April 2011, YouTube announced the rollout of *YouTube Live*. The creation of live streams was initially limited to select partners.[155] It was used for real-time broadcasting of events such as the 2012 Olympics in London.[156] In October 2012, more than 8 million people watched Felix Baumgartner's jump from the edge of space as a live stream on YouTube.[157]\n\n\nIn May 2013, creation of live streams was opened to verified users with at least 1,000 subscribers; in August of the same year the number was reduced to 100 subscribers,[158] and in December the limit was removed.[159] In February 2017, live streaming was introduced to the official YouTube mobile app. Live streaming via mobile was initially restricted to users with at least 10,000 subscribers,[160] but as of mid-2017 it has been reduced to 100 subscribers.[161] Live streams support HDR, can be up to 4K resolution at 60 fps, and also support 360° video.[144][162]\n\n\n\n### User features[edit]\n\n\n#### Comment system [edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google § YouTube user comments\n\nMost videos enable users to leave comments, which have attracted attention for the negative aspects of their form and content.[*specify*] In 2006, *Time* praised Web 2.0 for enabling \"community and collaboration on a scale never seen before\", and added that YouTube \"harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred\".[163] *The Guardian* in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as:[164]\n\n\n\n\n> Juvenile, aggressive, misspelt, sexist, homophobic, swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL, YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance—with the occasional burst of wit shining through.\n> \n> \n\n\n*The Daily Telegraph* commented in September 2008, that YouTube was \"notorious\" for \"some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet\", and reported on YouTube Comment Snob, \"a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts\".[165] *The Huffington Post* noted in April 2012 that finding comments on YouTube that appear \"offensive, stupid and crass\" to the \"vast majority\" of the people is hardly difficult.[166]\n\n\nGoogle subsequently implemented a comment system oriented on Google+ on November 6, 2013, that required all YouTube users to use a Google+ account to comment on videos. The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone.[167] The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse.[168][169] In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change.[170] The official YouTube announcement[171] received 20,097 \"thumbs down\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.[172] Writing in the *Newsday* blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network like Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\" and added that \"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with the outcry against the new comment system\". In the same article Melvin goes on to say:[173]\n\n\n\n\n> Perhaps user complaints are justified, but the idea of revamping the old system isn't so bad.\n> Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation. Isn't any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot? The system is far from perfect, but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity.\n> \n> \n\n\nLater, on July 27, 2015, Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google+ account to post comments to YouTube.[174] On November 3, 2016, YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve, hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments.[175] Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam. They can also allow other users to moderate their comments.[176]\n\n\nIn December 2020, it was reported that YouTube would launch a new feature that will warn users who post a comment that \"may be offensive to others.\"[177][178]\n\n\n\n#### Community[edit]\n\n\nOn September 13, 2016, YouTube launched a public beta of Community, a social media-based feature that allows users to post text, images (including GIFs), live videos and others in a separate \"Community\" tab on their channel.[179] Prior to the release, several creators had been consulted to suggest tools Community could incorporate that they would find useful; these YouTubers included Vlogbrothers, AsapScience, Lilly Singh, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons, Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger and Vsauce3.[180][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nAfter the feature has been officially released, the *community post* feature gets activated automatically for every channel that passes a specific threshold of subscriber counts or already has more subscribers. This threshold was lowered over time,[*when?*] from 10,000 subscribers to 1500 subscribers, to 1000 subscribers,[181][*non-primary source needed*] to 500 subscribers.[182]\n\n\nChannels that the community tab becomes enabled for, get their channel discussions (previously known as channel comments) permanently erased, instead of co-existing or migrating.[183][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n#### TestTube[edit]\n\n\nExperimental features of YouTube can be accessed in an area of the site named *TestTube*.[184][185]\n\n\nFor example, in October 2009, a *comment search* feature accessible under `/comment_search` was implemented as part of this program. The feature was removed later.[186]\n\n\nLater the same year, *YouTube Feather* was introduced as a \"lightweight\" alternative website for countries with limited internet speeds.[187]\n\n\n\n### Content accessibility[edit]\n\n\nYouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web.[188] This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by, or related to another user's video can make a \"video response\". The eleven character YouTube video identifier (64 possible characters used in each position), allows for a theoretical maximum of 6411 or around 73.8 quintillion (73.8 billion billion) unique ids.\n\n\nYouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature on August 27, 2013.[189] Embedding, rating, commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner.[190] YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos, and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface.[191] A small number of videos can be downloaded as MP4 files.[192] Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos.[193]\n\n\nIn February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout.[194] In June 2012, Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos.[195] In response, Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site.[196] Users retain copyright of their own work under the default Standard YouTube License,[197] but have the option to grant certain usage rights under any public copyright license they choose.\n\n\nSince July 2012, it has been possible to select a Creative Commons attribution license as the default, allowing other users to reuse and remix the material.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Platforms[edit]\n\n\nMost modern smartphones are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video.[199] Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.[200]\n\n\nSince June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone.[201]\n\n\nThe mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 in July 2010, avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls.[202] The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform.[203][204]\n\n\nIn September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system.[205] According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third-most used app.[206]\n\n\nA TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos.[207]\n\n\nIn January 2009, YouTube launched \"YouTube for TV\", a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers, initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles.[208][209]\n\n\nDuring the month of June that same year, YouTube XL was introduced, which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen.[210] YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live.[211]\n\n\nOn November 15, 2012, Google launched an official app for the Wii, allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel.[212] An app was available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, but was discontinued in August 2019.[213] Videos can also be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5.[214][*non-primary source needed*] Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17, 2013,[215] and, in October 2014, the Sony PlayStation 4.[216]\n\n\nYouTube launched as a downloadable app for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018.[217]\n\n\n\n### International and localization[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt appeared in Paris to launch the new localization system.[218] The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 104 countries, one territory (Hong Kong) and a worldwide version.[219]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

chosen based on the IP address of the user. In some cases, the message \"This video is not available in your country\" may appear because of copyright restrictions or inappropriate content.[268] The interface of the YouTube website is available in 76 language versions, including Amharic, Albanian, Armenian, Burmese, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Persian and Uzbek, which do not have local channel versions. Access to YouTube was blocked in Turkey between 2008 and 2010, following controversy over the posting of videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and some material offensive to Muslims.[269][270] In October 2012, a local version of YouTube was launched in Turkey, with the domain `youtube.com.tr`. The local version is subject to the content regulations found in Turkish law.[271] In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British royalty collection agency PRS for Music led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach an agreement on a licensing deal. The dispute was resolved in September 2009.[272] In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany.[273]\n\n\n\n## Videos[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television.[274] In 2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by *The Daily Dot* that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. This was disputed by *Billboard*, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.[276][277] On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behaviour which caused a video's view count to freeze at \"301\" (later \"301+\") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.[278] YouTube view counts once again updated in real time.[279]\n\n\nSince September 2019, subscriber counts are abbreviated. Only three leading digits of channels' subscriber counts are indicated publicly, compromising the function of third-party real-time indicators such as that of Social Blade. Exact counts remain available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio.[280]\n\n\nOn November 11, 2021, after testing out this change in March of the same year, YouTube announced it would start hiding dislike counts on videos, making them invisible to viewers. The company stated the decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment. Creators will still be able to see the number of likes and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool, according to YouTube.[281][282][283]\n\n\n\n### Copyright issues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube copyright issues\n\nFurther information: § Revenue to copyright holders\n\nYouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns.[32] At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws.[284] Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted.[285][286] From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.[287][288][289]\n\n\nIn August 2008, a US court ruled in *Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.* that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material.[290] YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply.[291]\n\n\nIn the 2011 case of *Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC*, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube.[292] He asserted seven causes of action, and four were ruled in Smith's favor.[293] In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users.[294] On November 1, 2016, the dispute with GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA.[295]\n\n\nIn April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice.[296][297] As part of YouTube Music, Universal and YouTube signed an agreement in 2017, which was followed by separate agreements other major labels, which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube.[298] By 2019, creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video, with different levels of enforcement depending on the record label.[299] Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use.[299]\n\n\n\n#### Content ID[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Content ID (system)\n\nIn June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute.[300] The system, which was initially called \"Video Identification\"[301][302] and later became known as Content ID,[303] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[304] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.\n\n\nAn independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was \"surprisingly resilient\" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.[305] The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.[306] If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.[307]\n\n\nBefore 2016, videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved. Since April 2016, videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute.[308] Should the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the \"Video Manager\".[309] YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.[310]\n\n\n\n### Moderation and offensive content[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google § YouTube, and Censorship by Google § YouTube\n\nYouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site's features. The uploading of videos containing defamation, pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube's \"Community Guidelines\".[311][*better source needed*] Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content, videos of animal abuse, shock videos, content uploaded without the copyright holder's consent, hate speech, spam, and predatory behavior.[311] YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's guidelines.[311] Despite the guidelines, YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations,[312] its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods,[313] hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters,[314] videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections,[315] and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising.[312]\n\n\nYouTube contracts companies to hire content moderators, who view content flagged as potentially violating YouTube's content policies and determines if they should be removed. In September 2020, a class-action suit was filed by a former content moderator who reported developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after an 18-month period on the job. The former content moderator said that she was regularly made to exceed YouTube's stated limit of four hours per day of viewing graphic content. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube's contractors gave little to no training or support for its moderators' mental health, made prospective employees sign NDAs before showing them any examples of content they would see while reviewing, and censored all mention of trauma from its internal forums. It also purports that requests for extremely graphic content to be blurred, reduced in size or made monochrome, per recommendations from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, were rejected by YouTube as not a high priority for the company.[316][317][318]\n\n\nTo limit the spread of misinformation and fake news via YouTube, it has rolled out a comprehensive policy regarding how it plans to deal with technically manipulated videos.[319]\n\n\nControversial content has included material relating to Holocaust denial and the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in 1989.[320][321] In July 2008, the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was \"unimpressed\" with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that \"proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content\". YouTube responded by stating:\n\n\n\n\n> We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly.[322] (July 2008)\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2010, U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner urged YouTube to remove from its website videos of imam Anwar al-Awlaki.[323] YouTube pulled some of the videos in November 2010, stating they violated the site's guidelines.[324] In December 2010, YouTube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content.[325]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube introduced a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other fake news, filling the infobox with content from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech.[326][327] In the wake of the Notre-Dame fire on April 15, 2019, several user-uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by YouTube' system automatically with an Encyclopædia Britannica article on the false conspiracy theories around the September 11 attacks. Several users complained to YouTube about this inappropriate connection. YouTube officials apologized for this, stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically, and were taking steps to remedy this.[328]\n\n\nOn April 18, 2023, YouTube revealed its changes in handling content associated with eating disorders. This social media platform's Community Guidelines now prohibit content that could encourage emulation from at-risk users. This content includes behavior that shows severe calorie tracking and purging after eating. However, videos featuring positive behavior such as in the context of recovery will be permitted on the platform under two conditions—the user must have a registered (logged-in) account and must be older than 18.\nThis policy was created in collaboration with nonprofit organizations as well as the National Eating Disorder Association. Garth Graham, YouTube's Global Head of Healthcare revealed in an interview with CNN that this policy change was geared at ensuring that this video-sharing platform provides an avenue for \"community recovery and resources\" while ensuring continued viewer protection.[329]\n\n\n\n#### Homophobia and transphobia[edit]\n\n\nFive leading content creators whose channels were based on LGBTQ+ materials filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube in August 2019, alleging that YouTube's algorithms divert discovery away from their channels, impacting their revenue. The plaintiffs claimed that the algorithms discourage content with words like \"lesbian\" or \"gay\", which would be predominant in their channels' content, and because of YouTube's near-monopolization of online video services, they are abusing that position.[330]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Media Matters, a media watchdog group, reported that homophobic and transphobic content calling LGBT people \"predators\" and \"groomers\" was becoming more common on YouTube.[331] The report also referred to common accusations in YouTube videos that LGBT people are mentally ill.[331] The report stated the content appeared to be in violation of YouTube's hate speech policy.[331]\n\n\n\n#### Animal torture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(July 2023)*\n |\n\n\nYouTube said animal abuse \"has no place on their platforms, and they are working to remove content\".[332][333][334][335][336][337]\n\n\n\n#### YouTube as a tool to promote conspiracy theories and far-right content[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been criticized for using an algorithm that gives great prominence to videos that promote conspiracy theories, falsehoods and incendiary fringe discourse.[338][339][340] According to an investigation by *The Wall Street Journal*, \"YouTube's recommendations often lead users to channels that feature conspiracy theories, partisan viewpoints and misleading videos, even when those users haven't shown interest in such content. When users show a political bias in what they choose to view, YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases, often with more-extreme viewpoints.\"[338][341] When users search for political or scientific terms, YouTube's search algorithms often give prominence to hoaxes and conspiracy theories.[340][342] After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking-news queries during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources.[338][343][344][345] In 2018, it was reported that YouTube was again promoting fringe content about breaking news, giving great prominence to conspiracy videos about Anthony Bourdain's death.[346]\n\n\nIn 2017, it was revealed that advertisements were being placed on extremist videos, including videos by rape apologists, anti-Semites, and hate preachers who received ad payouts.[347] After firms started to stop advertising on YouTube in the wake of this reporting, YouTube apologized and said that it would give firms greater control over where ads got placed.[347]\n\n\nAlex Jones, known for right-wing conspiracy theories, had built a massive audience on YouTube.[348] YouTube drew criticism in 2018 when it removed a video from Media Matters compiling offensive statements made by Jones, stating that it violated its policies on \"harassment and bullying\".[349] On August 6, 2018, however, YouTube removed Alex Jones' YouTube page following a content violation.[350]\n\n\nUniversity of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has referred to YouTube as \"The Great Radicalizer\", saying \"YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.\"[351] Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University described YouTube as a \"conspiracy ecosystem\".[340][352]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube said that it had introduced a new policy starting in the United States intended to stop recommending videos containing \"content that could misinform users in harmful ways.\" YouTube gave flat earth theories, miracle cures, and 9/11 trutherism as examples.[353] Efforts within YouTube engineering to stop recommending borderline extremist videos falling just short of forbidden hate speech, and track their popularity were originally rejected because they could interfere with viewer engagement.[354] In late 2019, the site began implementing measures directed towards \"raising authoritative content and reducing borderline content and harmful misinformation.\"[355]\n\n\nMultiple research studies have investigated cases of misinformation in YouTube. In a July 2019 study based on ten YouTube searches using the Tor Browser related to climate and climate change, the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change.[356] A May 2023 study found that YouTube was monetizing and profiting from videos that included misinformation about climate change.[357] A 2019 BBC investigation of YouTube searches in ten different languages found that YouTube's algorithm promoted health misinformation, including fake cancer cures.[358] In Brazil, YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters, as well as elevated far-right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories.[359] In the Philippines, numerous channels disseminated misinformation related to the 2022 Philippine elections.[360] Additionally, research on the dissemination of Flat Earth beliefs in social media, has shown that networks of YouTube channels form an echo chamber that polarizes audiences by appearing to confirm preexisting beliefs.[361]\n\n\n\n#### Use among white supremacists[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2019, YouTube took steps to remove specific videos or channels related to supremacist content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site-wide policies against hate speech.[362]\n\n\nIn the wake of the March 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks, YouTube and other sites like Facebook and Twitter that allowed user-submitted content drew criticism for doing little to moderate and control the spread of hate speech, which was considered to be a factor in the rationale for the attacks.[363][364] These platforms were pressured to remove such content, but in an interview with *The New York Times*, YouTube's chief product officer Neal Mohan said that unlike content such as ISIS videos which take a particular format and thus easy to detect through computer-aided algorithms, general hate speech was more difficult to recognize and handle, and thus could not readily take action to remove without human interaction.[365]\n\n\nYouTube joined an initiative led by France and New Zealand with other countries and tech companies in May 2019 to develop tools to be used to block online hate speech and to develop regulations, to be implemented at the national level, to be levied against technology firms that failed to take steps to remove such speech, though the United States declined to participate.[366][367] Subsequently, on June 5, 2019, YouTube announced a major change to its terms of service, \"specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.\" YouTube identified specific examples of such videos as those that \"promote or glorify Nazi ideology, which is inherently discriminatory\". YouTube further stated it would \"remove content denying that well-documented violent events, like the Holocaust or the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, took place.\"[362][368]\n\n\nIn October 2019, YouTube banned the main channel of Red Ice, a white supremacist multimedia company, for hate speech violations. The channel had about 330,000 subscribers. Lana Lokteff and Red Ice promoted a backup channel in an attempt to circumvent the ban.[369][370] A week later, the backup channel was also removed by YouTube.[371][372]\n\n\nIn June 2020, YouTube banned several channels associated with white supremacy, including those of Stefan Molyneux, David Duke, and Richard B. Spencer, asserting these channels violated their policies on hate speech. The ban occurred the same day that Reddit announced the ban on several hate speech sub-forums including r/The Donald.[373]\n\n\n\n#### Handling of COVID-19 pandemic and other misinformation[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the dissemination via YouTube of misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic that 5G communications technology was responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 which led to multiple 5G towers in the United Kingdom being attacked by arsonists, YouTube removed all such videos linking 5G and the coronavirus in this manner.[374]\n\n\nYouTube extended this policy in September 2021 to cover videos disseminating misinformation related to any vaccine, including those long approved against measles or Hepatitis B, that had received approval from local health authorities or the World Health Organization.[375][376] The platform removed the accounts of anti-vaccine campaigners such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Joseph Mercola at this time.[376] Two accounts linked to RT Deutsch, the German channel of the Russian RT network were removed as well for breaching YouTube's policies.[375]\n\n\nYouTube had extended this moderation to non-medical areas. In the weeks following the 2020 United States presidential election, the site added policies to remove or label videos promoting disproving election fraud claims;[377] however, it reversed this policy in June 2023, citing that the removal was necessary to \"openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial or based on disproven assumptions\".[378] Google and YouTube implemented policies in October 2021 to deny monetization or revenue to advertisers or content creators that promoted climate change denial, which \"includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.\"[379]\n\n\nIn July 2022 YouTube announced policies to combat misinformation surrounding abortion, such as videos with instructions to perform abortion methods that are considered unsafe and videos that contain misinformation about the safety of abortion.[380]\n\n\n\n#### Child safety and wellbeing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FamilyOFive, Fantastic Adventures scandal, and Elsagate\n\nLeading into 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children, coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family's activities, and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family-friendly material. In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90%.[381][382] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety. During Q2 2017, the owners of popular channel FamilyOFive, which featured themselves playing \"pranks\" on their children, were accused of child abuse. Their videos were eventually deleted, and two of their children were removed from their custody.[383][384][385][386] A similar case happened in 2019 when the owner of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children. Her videos would later be deleted.[387]\n\n\nLater that year, YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent, sexual or otherwise disturbing situations, many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views. The term \"Elsagate\" was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy.[388][389][390][391] On November 11, 2017, YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content. Later that month, the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family-friendly characters. As part of a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube, the wave of deletions also targeted channels that showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults. Most notably, the company removed *Toy Freaks*, a channel with over 8.5 million subscribers, that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations.[392][393][394][395][396] According to analytics specialist SocialBlade, it earned up to £8.7 million annually prior to its deletion.[397]\n\n\nEven for content that appears to be aimed at children and appears to contain only child-friendly content, YouTube's system allows for anonymity of who uploads these videos. These questions have been raised in the past, as YouTube has had to remove channels with children's content which, after becoming popular, then suddenly include inappropriate content masked as children's content.[398] Alternative, some of the most-watched children's programming on YouTube comes from channels that have no identifiable owners, raising concerns of intent and purpose. One channel that had been of concern was \"Cocomelon\" which provided numerous mass-produced animated videos aimed at children. Up through 2019, it had drawn up to US$10 million a month in ad revenue and was one of the largest kid-friendly channels on YouTube before 2020. Ownership of Cocomelon was unclear outside of its ties to \"Treasure Studio\", itself an unknown entity, raising questions as to the channel's purpose,[398][399][400] but *Bloomberg News* had been able to confirm and interview the small team of American owners in February 2020 regarding \"Cocomelon\", who stated their goal for the channel was to simply entertain children, wanting to keep to themselves to avoid attention from outside investors.[401] The anonymity of such channel raise concerns because of the lack of knowledge of what purpose they are trying to serve.[402] The difficulty to identify who operates these channels \"adds to the lack of accountability\", according to Josh Golin of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, and educational consultant Renée Chernow-O'Leary found the videos were designed to entertain with no intent to educate, all leading to critics and parents to be concerned for their children becoming too enraptured by the content from these channels.[398] Content creators that earnestly make child-friendly videos have found it difficult to compete with larger channels, unable to produce content at the same rate as them, and lacking the same means of being promoted through YouTube's recommendation algorithms that the larger animated channel networks have shared.[402]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube officially banned videos containing \"challenges that encourage acts that have an inherent risk of severe physical harm\" (such as the Tide Pod Challenge) and videos featuring pranks that \"make victims believe they're in physical danger\" or cause emotional distress in children.[403]\n\n\n\n##### Sexualization of children and pedophilia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Elsagate\n\nAlso in November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children—often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics—were attracting comments from pedophiles[404][405] with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian.[405] Other child-centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web, and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles.[406]\n\n\nAs a result of the controversy, which added to the concern about \"Elsagate\", several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube.[391][407] In December 2018, *The Times* found more than 100 grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior (such as taking off clothes, adopting overtly sexual poses and touching other children inappropriately) by strangers.[408] After a reporter flagged the videos in question, half of them were removed, and the rest were removed after *The Times* contacted YouTube's PR department.[408]\n\n\nIn February 2019, YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a \"wormhole\" that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content, and make all of that user's recommended content feature only these types of videos.[409] Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions or otherwise making indecent remarks. In some cases, other users had re-uploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos, and then monetized these, propagating this network.[410] In the wake of the controversy, the service reported that they had deleted over 400 channels and tens of millions of comments, and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A spokesperson explained that \"any content—including comments—that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.\"[411][412] Despite these measures, AT&T, Disney, Dr. Oetker, Epic Games, and Nestlé all pulled their advertising from YouTube.[410][413]\n\n\nSubsequently, YouTube began to demonetize and block advertising on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments. The service explained that this was a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem.[414] YouTube also began to flag channels that predominantly feature children, and preemptively disable their comments sections. \"Trusted partners\" can request that comments be re-enabled, but the channel will then become responsible for moderating comments. These actions mainly target videos of toddlers, but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual, such as gymnastics. YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators.[415][416]\n\n\nA related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string \"CP\" (an abbreviation of child pornography) resulted in some prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation, including videos related to the mobile video game *Pokémon Go* (which uses \"CP\" as an abbreviation of the statistic \"Combat Power\"), and *Club Penguin*. YouTube apologized for the errors and reinstated the affected videos.[417] Separately, online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said; this activity became an issue during the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in early 2019. YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity.[418]\n\n\nIn June 2019, *The New York Times* cited researchers who found that users who watched erotic videos could be recommended seemingly innocuous videos of children.[419] As a result, Senator Josh Hawley stated plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban YouTube and other video sharing sites from including videos that predominantly feature minors as \"recommended\" videos, excluding those that were \"professionally produced\", such as videos of televised talent shows.[420] YouTube has suggested potential plans to remove all videos featuring children from the main YouTube site and transferring them to the YouTube Kids site where they would have stronger controls over the recommendation system, as well as other major changes on the main YouTube site to the recommended feature and autoplay system.[421]\n\n\n\n#### Misogyny[edit]\n\n\nA January 2022 report by the social media analytics firm Bot Sentinel said that several online influencers were using YouTube to exclusively post negative content about Prince Harry and Meghan, including conspiracy theories about the couple, in what it called \"a lucrative hate-for-profit enterprise\" where \"racism and YouTube ad revenue are the primary motivators.\" Bot Sentinel also found that one of the most prominent accounts promoting a conspiracy theory that Meghan was never pregnant had accumulated nearly 19 million views and was earning around $44,000 a year. YouTube banned the account in March.[422]\n\n\nAn August 2022 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a British think tank, found that harassment against women was flourishing on YouTube. It noted that channels espousing a similar ideology to that of men's rights influencer Andrew Tate were using YouTube to grow their audience, despite Tate being banned from the platform.[423] In his 2022 book *Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise to World Domination*, Bloomberg reporter Mark Bergen said that many female content creators were dealing with harassment, bullying and stalking.[423]\n\n\n\n### April Fools gags[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Google April Fools' Day jokes\n\nYouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016. In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a prank known as \"rickrolling\".[424][425] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a \"new layout\".[426] In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a \"TEXTp\" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters \"in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.\"[427]\n\n\nThe next year, the site celebrated its \"100th anniversary\" with a range of sepia-toned silent, early 1900s-style films, including a parody of Keyboard Cat.[428] In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on DVD.[429]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company *The Onion* to claim in an uploaded video that the video-sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.[430][431]\n\n\nIn 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as \"Clocking\", \"Kissing Dad\", and \"Glub Glub Water Dance\".[432] The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from \"Sandstorm\" by Darude.[433] In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.[434]\n\n\n\n## Services[edit]\n\n\n### YouTube Premium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Premium\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Premium\nYouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers advertising-free streaming, access to original programming, and background and offline video playback on mobile devices.[435] YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as \"Music Key\", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music \"All Access\" service.[436][437][438] On October 28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos and access to exclusive original content.[439][440][441] As of November 2016[update], the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis.[442] As of June 2017[update], the first season of YouTube Originals had gotten 250 million views in total.[443]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Kids[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Kids\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Kids\nYouTube Kids is an American children's video app developed by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google. The app was developed in response to parental and government scrutiny on the content available to children. The app provides a version of the service-oriented towards children, with curated selections of content, parental control features, and filtering of videos deemed inappropriate viewing for children aged under 13, 8 or 5 depending on the age grouping chosen. First released on February 15, 2015, as an Android and iOS mobile app, the app has since been released for LG, Samsung, and Sony smart TVs, as well as for Android TV. On May 27, 2020, it became available on Apple TV. As of September 2019, the app is available in 69 countries, including Hong Kong and Macau, and one province. YouTube launched a web-based version of YouTube Kids on August 30, 2019.\n\n\n\n### YouTube Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Music\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Music\nOn September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the co-founder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music Group executive, the Global Head of Music.[444]\n\n\nIn early 2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a platform that would compete with other services such as Spotify and Apple Music.[445] On May 22, 2018, the music streaming platform named \"YouTube Music\" was launched.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Movies[edit]\n\n\nYouTube Movies is a service by YouTube that shows movies via its website. Around 100–500 movies are free to view, with ads. Some new movies get added and some get removed, unannounced at a new month.[448]\n\n\n\n### YouTube TV[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube TV\n\n![](image)YouTube TV logo\nOn February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$65 per month. Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017,[449][450] the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC), as well as approximately 40 cable channels owned by the corporate parents of those networks, The Walt Disney Company, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal and Turner Broadcasting System (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN). Subscribers can also receive Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Premium original content.[451][452]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Go[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Go\nIn September 2016, *YouTube Go* was announced,[453] as an Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets. It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users. It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution.[454]\n\n\nIn February 2017, *YouTube Go* was launched in India, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South Africa.[455][456] On February 1, 2018, it was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq. Before it shut down, the app was available to around 60% of the world's population.[457][458] In May 2022, Google announced that they would be shutting down *YouTube Go* in August 2022.[459]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Shorts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Shorts\n\nAn example video that is suitable for YouTube Shorts, showing Crew Dragon *Endeavour* docking at the International Space Station\nIn September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts.[460][461] The platform was first tested in India but as of March 2021 has expanded to other countries including the United States with videos now able to be up to 1 minute long.[462] The platform is not a standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app. Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools, including the possibility of adding licensed music to their videos.[463] The platform had its global beta launch in July 2021.[464]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Stories[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube started testing a new feature initially called \"YouTube Reels\".[465] The feature is nearly identical to Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories. YouTube later renamed the feature \"YouTube Stories\". It is only available to creators who have more than 10,000 subscribers and can only be posted/seen in the YouTube mobile app.[466] On May 25, 2023, YouTube announced that it would be shutting down this feature on June 26, 2023.[467][468]\n\n\n\n## Social impact[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social impact of YouTube\n\nPrivate individuals[469] and large production corporations[470] have used YouTube to grow their audiences. Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic.[469] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television.[470] While YouTube's revenue-sharing \"Partner Program\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually[471] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million[472]—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \"a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels.\"[473] In 2013 *Forbes*' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.[474] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \"mega\", \"mainstream\" and \"mid-sized\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year.[475] By early 2013, *Billboard* had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the *Billboard* Hot 100 and related genre charts.[476]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan Hoffner at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards accepting for YouTube\nObserving that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been \"fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution\", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that \"what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication.\"[477] Anderson asserted that it is not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch \"the biggest learning cycle in human history.\"[477] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what *Forbes'* Michael Noer called \"the largest school in the world,\" with technology poised to disrupt how people learn.[478] YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award,[479] the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that \"both embodies and promotes democracy.\"[480] *The Washington Post* reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white.[481] A Pew Research Center study reported the development of \"visual journalism\", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation.[482] The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.[483]\n\n\nYouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape.[484] Describing the Arab Spring (2010–2012), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using \"Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.\"[485] In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the \"Kony 2012\" video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video \"will do more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined.\"[486]\n\n\n\n![](image)Leading YouTube content creators met at the White House with U.S. President Obama to discuss how government could better connect with the \"YouTube generation.\"[487][488]\nConversely, YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012[489] and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance.[490] In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare[491] but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the \"YouTube Generation.\"[487] Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.[487]\n\n\nSome YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as *Innocence of Muslims* (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.[492] TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.[477] Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in *The New York Times* that such videos have \"surprising implications\" for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.[493]\n\n\nA 2017 article in *The New York Times Magazine* posited that YouTube had become \"the new talk radio\" for the far right.[494] Almost a year before YouTube's January 2019 announcement that it would begin a \"gradual change\" of \"reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways\",[495] Zeynep Tufekci had written in *The New York Times* that, \"(g)iven its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century\".[496] Under YouTube's changes to its recommendation engine, the most recommended channel evolved from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (2016) to Fox News (2019).[497] According to a 2020 study, \"An emerging journalistic consensus theorizes the central role played by the video 'recommendation engine,' but we believe that this is premature. Instead, we propose the 'Supply and Demand' framework for analyzing politics on YouTube.\"[498] A 2022 study found that \"despite widespread concerns that YouTube's algorithms send people down 'rabbit holes' with recommendations to extremist videos, little systematic evidence exists to support this conjecture\", \"exposure to alternative and extremist channel videos on YouTube is heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment.\", and \"contrary to the 'rabbit holes' narrative, non-subscribers are rarely recommended videos from alternative and extremist channels and seldom follow such recommendations when offered.\"[499]\n\n\n*The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers*[500] and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra[501] selected their membership based on individual video performances.[477][501] Further, the cybercollaboration charity video \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)\" was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work,[502] with *The Tokyo Times* noting the \"We Pray for You\" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.[503]\nThe anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens,[504] that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet secretaries.[505] Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video \"My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm,\" legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy.[506] In May 2018, after London Metropolitan Police claimed that drill music videos glamorizing violence gave rise to gang violence, YouTube deleted 30 videos.[507]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nPrior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as \"not material\" in a regulatory filing.[508] In June 2008, a *Forbes* magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.[509] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion.[510] In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to eMarketer,[510][511] while others estimated $4.7 billion.[510] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising.[62] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month.[512] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.[62]\n\n\nGoogle first published exact revenue numbers for YouTube in February 2020 as part of Alphabet's 2019 financial report. According to Google, YouTube had made US$15.1 billion in ad revenue in 2019, in contrast to US$8.1 billion in 2017 and US$11.1 billion in 2018. YouTube's revenues made up nearly 10% of the total Alphabet revenue in 2019.[513][514] These revenues accounted for approximately 20 million subscribers combined between YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions, and 2 million subscribers to YouTube TV.[515]\n\n\nYouTube had $19.8 billion in revenue in 2020.[516]\n\n\n\n### Partnership with corporations[edit]\n\n\nYouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[517] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment.[518] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called \"Shows\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[519][520] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[521] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service,[522] which is only available to users in the United States, Canada, and the UK as of 2010.[523][524][*needs update*] The service offers over 6,000 films.[525]\n\n\n\n#### 2017 advertiser boycott[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would \"be delivered safely and appropriately\". *The Guardian* newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had \"begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear\".[526][527] In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a *Wall Street Journal* article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.[528][529]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2017, YouTube announced that to \"ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules\", it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000-lifetime views, before they may join the Partner Program.[530]\n\n\n\n### YouTuber earnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Total annual earnings of the top ten YouTuber accounts, and the income of the single highest-earning account.\nIn May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site.[531] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.[532][533]\n\n\nThere are over two million members of the YouTube Partner Program.[534] According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually, no more than half of the eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.[535]\n\n\nYouTube's policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising, including videos containing violence, strong language, sexual content, \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\" (unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\"),[536] and videos whose user comments contain \"inappropriate\" content.[537]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos.[538][539] In April 2017, YouTube set an eligibility requirement of 10,000 lifetime views for a paid subscription.[540] On January 16, 2018, the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to 4,000 hours of watch-time within the past 12 months and 1,000 subscribers.[540] The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to controversy, but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels.[541]\n\n\nYouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.[542] The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal, ruby, and red tinted crystal glass are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million, fifty million subscribers, and one hundred million subscribers, respectively.[543][544]\n\n\nYouTube's policies on \"advertiser-friendly content\" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized; this includes strong violence, language,[545] sexual content, and \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\", unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\".[546] In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent users, including Phillip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was \"censorship by a different name\". A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new, the service had \"improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators\".[547][548][549] *Boing Boing* reported in 2019 that LGBT keywords resulted in demonetization.[550]\n\n\nAs of November 2020 in the United States and June 2021 worldwide,[551] YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform, even if their uploader is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program. This will occur on channels whose content is deemed \"advertiser-friendly\", and all revenue will go directly to Google without any share given to the uploader.[552]\n\n\n\n### Revenue to copyright holders[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: § Copyrighted material\n\nThe majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue.[553] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders. YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue.[554] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games.[555] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program.[556][557][558] On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program. Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019.[559][560]\n\n\n\n## Censorship and bans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Censorship of YouTube\n\n![](image)Availability of YouTube as of January 2021:  \n Has local YouTube version\n Accessible (Worldwide version)\n Currently blocked\n Previously blocked\n\nYouTube has been censored, filtered, or banned for a variety of reasons, including:[561]\n\n\n\n* Limiting public access and exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest.\n* Preventing criticism of a ruler (e.g. in North Korea), government (e.g. in China) or its actions (e.g. in Morocco), government officials (e.g. in Turkey and Libya), or religion (e.g. in Pakistan).\n* Morality-based laws, e.g. in Iran.\n\n\nAccess to specific videos is sometimes prevented due to copyright and intellectual property protection laws (e.g. in Germany), violations of hate speech, and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate for youth,[562] which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with \"restricted mode\".[563] Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to its bandwidth limitations[564][565] and the site's potential for distraction.[561][566]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], public access to YouTube is blocked in many countries, including China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan,[567] Uzbekistan,[568][569] Tajikistan, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. In some countries, YouTube is blocked for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.[561]\n\n\nReports emerged that since October 2019, comments posted with Chinese characters insulting the Chinese Communist Party (共匪 or \"communist bandit\") or (五毛 or \"50 Cent Party\", referring to state-sponsored commentators) were being automatically deleted within 15 seconds.[570]\n\n\nSpecific incidents where YouTube has been blocked include:\n\n\n\n* Thailand blocked access in April 2007 over a video said to be insulting the Thai king.[571]\n* Morocco blocked access in May 2007, possibly as a result of videos critical of Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara.[572] YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007, after *Maroc Telecom* unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere \"technical glitch\".[573]\n* Turkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.[574][575][576] In November 2010, a video of the Turkish politician Deniz Baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly, and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video.[577] During the two and a half-year block of YouTube, the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed site in Turkey.[578][579] In 2014, Turkey blocked the access for the second time, after \"a high-level intelligence leak.\"[580][581][582]\n* Pakistan blocked access on February 23, 2008, because of \"offensive material\" towards the Islamic faith, including display of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.[583] This led to a near global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours, as the Pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries. On February 26, 2008, the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government.[584][585] Many Pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private network software.[586] In May 2010, following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube, citing \"growing sacrilegious content\".[587] The ban was lifted on May 27, 2010, after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government. However, individual videos deemed offensive to Muslims posted on YouTube will continue to be blocked.[588][589] Pakistan again placed a ban on YouTube in September 2012, after the site refused to remove the film *Innocence of Muslims*. The ban was lifted in January 2016 after YouTube launched a Pakistan-specific version.[590]\n* Libya blocked access on January 24, 2010, because of videos that featured demonstrations in the city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch.[591] In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.[592]\n* Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sudan blocked access in September 2012 following controversy over a 14-minute trailer for the film *Innocence of Muslims* which had been posted on the site.[593][594][595][596][597] A court in the southern Russian Republic of Chechnya ruled that *Innocence of Muslims* should be banned.[598] In Libya and Egypt, it was blamed for violent protests. YouTube stated: \"This video—which is widely available on the Web—is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries.\"[599][600]\n* Russia threatened to ban YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021.[601] Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube announced on March 1 the immediate removal of RT (and other Russian-government funded outlets) from its platform in Europe.[602]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Invidious, a free and open-source alternative frontend to YouTube\n* Alternative media\n* BookTube\n* BreadTube\n* CNN/YouTube presidential debates\n* Lists\n\t+ Comparison of video hosting services\n\t+ List of Google Easter eggs#YouTube\n\t+ List of Internet phenomena\n\t+ List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-liked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n\t+ List of online video platforms\n\t+ List of YouTubers\n* Lawsuits\n\t+ *Viacom International Inc. v.

Kjellberg's popularity on YouTube and extensive media coverage have made him one of the most noted online personalities and content creators. He has been portrayed in the media as a figurehead for YouTube, especially in the genre of gaming. \n\n\nBorn and raised in Gothenburg, Kjellberg registered his YouTube channel \"PewDiePie\" in 2010, primarily posting Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel gained a substantial following and was one of the fastest growing channels in 2012 and 2013, before becoming the most-subscribed on YouTube on 15 August 2013. From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, Kjellberg's channel was also the most-viewed on the platform. During this period, his content shifted focus from Let's Plays and diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos.\n\n\nKjellberg's content was already noted for its polarizing reception among general audiences online, but in the late 2010s, it became more controversial and attracted increased media scrutiny. In 2019, following a public competition with Indian record label T-Series, Kjellberg was overtaken as the most-subscribed YouTube channel. Kjellberg also became more reserved online, uploading less consistently and taking frequent breaks from Internet use. He eventually semi-retired from YouTube, choosing to upload less frequently for his enjoyment rather than as a career. Meanwhile, in his personal life, he moved to Japan with his wife, Italian Internet personality Marzia.\n\n\nWith over 111 million subscribers and 29 billion views,[c] his channel still ranks as one of the most-subscribed and viewed on YouTube. His popularity online has been noted to boost sales for the video games he plays, and has allowed him to stir support for charity fundraising drives. In 2016, *Time* magazine named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nFelix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg was born on 24 October 1989 in Gothenburg, where he was also raised.[8][9] He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna (née Hellstrand, born 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 1957), and grew up with his older sister, Fanny.[10] His mother, a former chief information officer (CIO), was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden.[10] His father is a corporate executive.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kjellberg studied at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg.\nDuring his childhood, Kjellberg was interested in art and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as play video games on his Super Nintendo Entertainment System, such as *Star Fox* and *Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest*.[12][13][14] During high school, he frequently played video games in his bedroom and would skip classes to join at an Internet café with friends.[12][13] During his last year of high school, he bought a computer with the money he made selling artwork through his grandmother's gallery.[12]\n\n\nKjellberg then went on to pursue a degree in industrial engineering and management at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, but left the university in 2011.[4][15] While it has been reported that he left Chalmers to focus on his YouTube career,[15] Kjellberg clarified in 2017 that he had left due to a lack of interest in his course of study. He further expressed that, in general, leaving university to pursue a YouTube career would be \"fucking stupid\".[‡ 3]\n\n\nKjellberg has also discussed an enjoyment of Adobe Photoshop, wanting to work on photo manipulation art using the program rather than be in school.[‡ 3] Following this passion after he departed from Chalmers, he entered Photoshop contests and almost earned an apprenticeship at a prominent Scandinavian advertising agency.[‡ 3] He was also interested in creating content on YouTube; after not earning the apprenticeship, he sold limited edition prints of his photoshopped images to purchase a computer to work on YouTube videos.[‡ 3]\n\n\n\n##  Internet career[edit]\n\n\n### 2010–2012: early years[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg originally registered a YouTube account under the name \"Pewdie\" in December 2006; he explained that \"pew\" represents the sound of lasers and \"die\" refers to dying.[12][16][17] After initially forgetting the password to this account, he registered the \"PewDiePie\" YouTube channel on 29 April 2010.[16] Following his exit from Chalmers, his parents refused to financially support him,[16] so he funded his early videos by working as a harbor captain, selling prints of his Photoshop art, and working at a hot dog stand.[‡ 3][18] Kjellberg stated that the ability to make videos was more important to him than a prestigious career.[18] Five years later, Kjellberg recalled, \"I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn't know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do.\"[18]\n\n\nIn his early years as a YouTube creator, Kjellberg focused on video game commentaries, most notably of horror and action video games.[19][20][21] Some of his earliest videos featured commentaries of mainstream video games including *Minecraft* and *Call of Duty*, although he was particularly noted for his Let's Plays of *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* and its related mods.[22][23] On these videos, Kjellberg has stated \"I was so shy back then,\" and added, \"It was so weird to me, sitting alone in a room talking into a microphone. That was unheard of back at the time. No one really did it.\"[13] Kjellberg's oldest video available for viewing is titled \"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\".[22] Uploaded on 2 October 2010, the video is noted for containing mainly Swedish commentary from Kjellberg, rather than the English language he would later employ in his videos.[22] The video has amassed over 21 million video views as of August 2022.[‡ 4]\n\n\nStarting on 2 September 2011, he also began posting weekly vlogs under the title of *Fridays with PewDiePie*.[13] The series was a weekly deviation from the Let's Play videos that formed most of his content output at the time, and often featured vlogs, and Kjellberg completing viewer requests.[13][24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fan art of Kjellberg from 2012, depicting him as a character from *Happy Wheels*\nBy December 2011, Kjellberg's channel had around 60,000 subscribers,[16] before rapidly increasing in 2012. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, Kjellberg spoke at Nonick Conference 2012.[25][26] July 2012 saw his channel reaching 1 million subscribers,[8] and it reached 2 million subscribers in September.[19] In October, OpenSlate ranked Kjellberg's channel as the No. 1 YouTube channel.[27] Kjellberg signed with Maker Studios in December, a multi-channel network (MCN) that drives the growth of the channels under it.[16] Prior to his partnership with Maker, he was signed to Machinima, which operates as a rival to Maker.[28] Kjellberg expressed feeling neglected by Machinima, and frustrated with their treatment; he hired a lawyer to free him from his contract with the network.[28]\n\n\nEarly in his YouTube career, Kjellberg used jokes about rape in his videos.[29] A satirical video, created by Let's Play YouTuber Michael \"Slowbeef\" Sawyer, mocking Kjellberg's content highlighted his usage of such jokes.[30] Shortly after, Kjellberg attracted criticism and controversy for the jokes, and in October 2012, he addressed the issue through a Tumblr post, writing, \"I just wanted to make clear that I'm no longer making rape jokes, as I mentioned before I'm not looking to hurt anyone and I apologise if it ever did.\"[‡ 5] *The Globe and Mail* stated \"*unlike* many young gamers, he listened when fans and critics alike pointed out their harmful nature, and resolved to stop making rape jokes.\"[29]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2014: becoming the most-subscribed user and continued growth[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 February 2013, Kjellberg's channel reached 5 million subscribers.[16] In April, he was covered in *The New York Times* after surpassing 6 million subscribers.[31] In May 2013, at the inaugural Starcount Social Stars Awards in Singapore, Kjellberg won the award for \"Swedish Social Star\".[32] Competing against Jenna Marbles, Smosh, and Toby Turner,[33] he won the award for \"Most Popular Social Show\".[34] In July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second most-subscribed YouTube user,[35] and reached 10 million subscribers on 9 July 2013.[16][36] In August, Kjellberg signed with Maker's gaming sub-network, Polaris.[37] Polaris functioned as a relaunching of The Game Station, Maker's gaming network.[38]\n\n\nKjellberg's subscriber count surpassed that of the leading channel, Smosh, on 15 August.[39] Kjellberg received a certificate from Guinness World Records for becoming the most subscribed YouTuber.[40] In November, YouTube's Spotlight channel overtook Kjellberg's as the most-subscribed.[41] Later in the month, Kjellberg proclaimed his dislike of YouTube's new comment system, and disabled the comment section on all of his videos.[42] On 23 December 2013, his channel overtook the YouTube Spotlight channel, to once again become the most-subscribed on YouTube.[43][44] Throughout 2012 and 2013, Kjellberg's channel was one of the fastest-growing on YouTube, in terms of subscribers gained.[45] *Billboard* reported that the channel gained more subscribers than any other channel in 2013.[46]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kjellberg's commentaries, originally best known for featuring horror video games, began to feature games that interested him regardless of genre. *Kotaku* wrote: \"Instead of limiting himself to horror games, Pewdiepie is now actively playing more things that interest him.\"[22]\n\n\n\n> \n> Around 2014, as YouTube began to invest more deeply in creators, the company developed a classification system for its stable of stars. Either they followed the *SNL* model, using YouTube to springboard into TV or film, or they took the Oprah path, building empires of fervent audiences right on YouTube.\n> \n> \n> PewDiePie was one of the best Oprahs. He lived and breathed YouTube.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n –Mark Bengen, *Like, Comment, Subscribe* (2022)[47]\n\nIn March 2014, he updated his video production output, announcing he would be scaling down the frequency of uploads.[48] In August 2014, Maker Studios released an official PewDiePie app for the iPhone, allowing audiences to view his videos, create custom favourite video feeds, and share videos with others.[49] Later in the month, Kjellberg uploaded a video, announcing he would permanently disable comments on his YouTube videos.[50] He cited most comments being spam and self-advertising and was not what he wanted to see.[51] After disabling comments, Kjellberg continued interacting with his audience through Twitter and Reddit.[52]\n\n\nOn 13 October, he decided to allow comments on his videos once more, albeit only after approval.[53] However, he expressed that he toggled his comment settings this way so that he could redirect viewers to instead comment on the forums of his Broarmy.net website.[54] He stated in a later video that disabling comments made him happier.[55] In the same year, Kjellberg began streaming videos of his co-hosted series, *BroKen*, onto MLG.tv.[56] He co-hosted the series with Kenneth Morrison, better known as CinnamonToastKen, who is also a video game commentator.[57]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Kjellberg hinted at the possibility that he would not renew his contract with Maker Studios upon its expiration in December 2014.[58] He had expressed his frustrations with the studio's parent company, Disney.[28] Kjellberg mulled the option of launching his own network.[59][60] However, in light of news outlets reporting his disinterest with Maker, he tweeted, \"I feel like I was misquoted in The *WSJ*, and I'm really happy with the work that Maker has been doing for me.\"[61] Kjellberg ultimately continued creating videos under Maker. His relationship with Maker saw the network launch an official PewDiePie website, app, and online store to sell merchandise, while Kjellberg promoted Maker's media interests, and gave the network a share of his YouTube ad revenue.[13]\n\n\nIn 2014 alone, Kjellberg's account amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers, and over 4.1 billion total views. Both figures were higher than any other user.[62][63] According to Social Blade, Kjellberg's channel became the most-viewed channel on the website on 29 December 2014, having amassed over 7 billion views by that date.[64][65]\n\n\n\n### 2015–2017: YouTube Red, Revelmode, and style change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kjellberg at PAX in 2015\n*The New York Times* retrospectively noted that around 2015, Kjellberg's video content experienced a change in style: \"He began to take more risks. He continued playing video games, but he started experimenting. He did viral challenges, made fun of other YouTubers, and reviewed meme submissions from his fans.\"[66] Kjellberg has attributed his content around this time as a result of immaturity, boredom with playing video games, YouTube's platform incentives, and the belief that his channel's growth had plateaued.[66] One video cited as being representative of this change featured Kjellberg reading erotic fan fiction about characters from the Disney film *Frozen*. Then-CEO of The Walt Disney Company Bob Iger was reportedly angered by the video, putting Kjellberg's deal with Maker Studios, a Disney subsidiary, in jeopardy.[66]\n\n\nOn 6 September 2015, his YouTube account became the first to surpass 10 billion video views.[11][67] Later in the month, Kjellberg teased about having a role in a web television series, stating that he was in Los Angeles for the show's shooting.[68] Although not many details were revealed at the time, it was later announced that the series would be an original YouTube Red series, titled *Scare PewDiePie*.[69] The series premiered the following February.[70]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Kjellberg announced a partnership with Maker Studios to produce Revelmode, a sub-network of Maker, that would showcase Kjellberg and his friends on YouTube in original series.[71] After the deal, the head of Maker Studios, Courtney Holt, stated, \"we're thrilled to be doubling down with Felix.\"[71] Along with Kjellberg, eight other YouTubers signed to the network upon its creation: CinnamonToastKen, Marzia, Dodger, Emma Blackery, Jacksepticeye, Jelly, Kwebbelkop, and Markiplier.[71] Three YouTubers – Cryaotic, KickThePJ, and Slogoman – would later join the sub-network after its launch.[72][73]\n\n\nThroughout 2016, Kjellberg's video style change became more apparent.[74] While producing fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour changed; he commented that he had shifted to drier humour, which was often not understood by younger viewers.[75] He examined his older videos, and while noting the stylistic changes he had undergone, he expressed specific regret for his casual use of words like *gay* or *retarded* in a derogatory sense.[76] In December 2016, *Kotaku*'s Patricia Hernandez wrote about his stylistic changes, explaining that \"over the last year, the PewDiePie channel has also had an underlying friction, as Kjellberg slowly distances himself from many of the things that made him famous. He's doing fewer Let's Plays of horror games like *Amnesia*,[75] and adding, \"the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, as he describes the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand.\"[75]\n\n\nOn 2 December 2016, he uploaded a video discussing his frustration with the issue of YouTube accounts experiencing an unexplained loss of subscribers and views.[‡ 6][77] Kjellberg stated that many people working with YouTube \"have no idea of the struggles that came with being a content creator.\"[75] A Google representative issued a statement to *Ars Technica*, stating that no decreases in subscriber numbers were out of the ordinary.[77] Kjellberg's video was uploaded as his channel approached 50 million subscribers, and he stated he would delete his channel once it reached the milestone.[78] On 8 December, his channel reached 50 million subscribers, becoming the first YouTube channel to do so.[79] He shortly thereafter received a custom Play Button from YouTube as a reward for reaching this milestone.[2] Ultimately, Kjellberg did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead deleted a smaller second channel he had then-recently created.[80] His threat to quit was also reported to be \"in fact, a promotional stunt\" for *Scare PewDiePie*.[47]\n\n\nKjellberg nevertheless continued to express discontent with the platform, aiming further criticism at YouTube's changing algorithm negatively affecting viewership for content creators.[80][81] The site's algorithm began to focus on watch time statistics and \"favor videos that drew daily viewers, higher engagement (more likes and comments) and cleaner 'ad-friendly' fare.\"[47] Kjellberg later recounted to *The New York Times* that the platform's boundaries were widely unknown to creators.[47] He responded to the algorithm changes by uploading vlogs that \"mixed earnest schmaltz [...] with inanity.\" Additionally, he \"enjoyed wading into the meme culture and edgelord humor that accompanied Donald Trump's ascent\".[47]\n\n\nDuring this late 2016 and early 2017 period Kjellberg uploaded a string of videos addressing what Kjellberg saw as negative effects to content creator viewership caused by the new algorithm.[80][82][83] As a satirical knock on the changing algorithms, Kjellberg made several videos asking viewers to help the video reach specific engagement milestones such as one million likes, dislikes, and comments.[82][84][85] The videos were successful, promptly achieving the goal Kjellberg requested from viewers;[82] the dislike video accumulated over 5 million dislikes before YouTube made such figures private in November 2021, becoming one of the most-disliked on the entire platform.[86]\n\n\n\n### 2017–2018: media controversies, streaming, and formatted shows[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I've made some jokes that people don't like. And you know what? If people don't like my jokes, I fully respect that. I fully understand that. I acknowledge that I took things too far, and that's something I definitely will keep in mind moving forward, but the reaction and the outrage have been nothing but insanity.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n –Felix Kjellberg, *My Response* video, February 2017 (relating to Fiverr controversy)[‡ 7]\n\nIn a video posted in January 2017, Kjellberg featured two paid individuals on Fiverr, asked to hold a sign that read \"Death to all Jews\". He alleged his intent was not against Jews, but to showcase how \"crazy\" the modern world and website were.[47][87][88] The video received negative attention and caused a media backlash, with various publications writing critically of Kjellberg's defense of his controversial content as jokes taken out of context, and opining that his content helps normalise ideologies such as fascism, neo-Nazism, and white supremacy.[89][90][91]\n\n\n*The Wall Street Journal* alleged that this was not the first time Kjellberg had used antisemitic language and imagery in his videos.[92][93] Kjellberg and the two individuals later apologised,[87] but the event led Maker Studios to cut their ties with Kjellberg and Google to drop him from the Google Preferred advertising program and cancel the upcoming second season of the *Scare PewDiePie* YouTube Red series.[94][95] Ultimately, Kjellberg apologised, but strongly rebuked media coverage of the event, with particular criticism aimed at *The Wall Street Journal* for how their reporting portrayed references to Nazis in some of his videos.[96] *The Wall Street Journal* response referred to another video with a YouTuber going by the name Jesus Christ, stating \"Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong,\" as well as Kjellberg's response to the Fiverr suspension of the Jesus Christ account.[96]\n\n\nAccording to Social Blade, his channel's total view count was surpassed by the Indian record label T-Series at the top of YouTube's view rankings on 14 February.[97][98]\n\n\nIn April, while still continuing to upload new content onto YouTube, Kjellberg created Netglow, a crowdsourced channel on the livestreaming service Twitch.[99] On Netglow, he started streaming *Best Club*, a weekly live stream show.[99] *Best Club* premiered on 9 April, with its first episode featuring Brad Smith alongside Kjellberg.[99] Kjellberg commented that his decision to create Netglow was in the works prior to the aforementioned allegations of antisemitic themes in his videos.[99] *Business Insider* detailed that Kjellberg's first stream amassed around 60,000 viewers, and that Netglow had accumulated 93,000 subscribers to that point.[100]\n\n\nIn September, while Kjellberg was live-streaming gameplay of *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds* to his YouTube channel, he used the ethnic slur \"nigger\" towards another player in the game.[87] The video clip of the incident quickly went viral despite Kjellberg deleting it, and garnered widespread criticism across the internet.[101] Kjellberg later apologised for the incident in a short video uploaded to his YouTube channel.[102] As a response to the incident, Campo Santo co-founder Sean Vanaman referred to Kjellberg as \"worse than a closeted racist\", announced that Campo Santo would file copyright strikes against Kjellberg's videos featuring the studio's game *Firewatch*, and encouraged other game developers to do the same.[103][104] Amidst the controversy stirred up by the incident, it was brought to light that Kjellberg was following several prominent far-right and white supremacist figures on Twitter, such as Stefan Molyneux, Carl Benjamin and Lauren Southern.[105] He later deactivated his Twitter account and unfollowed everyone he was previously following, stating \"What I don't like is the constant posturing that goes on there. People just can't seem to help themselves from pointing out what is good and what is bad, or how others are bad and you are good.\"[106]\n\n\nIn 2018, Paul MacInnes of *The Guardian* wrote about Kjellberg's YouTube content; he noted that each week Kjellberg posted videos featuring one of three series formats, comparing this uploading pattern to television programming.[107] The three series listed were *You Laugh You Lose*, which features Kjellberg watching humorous video clips while trying to not laugh; *Last Week I Asked You* (*LWIAY*), having begun as a parody and homage to Jack Douglass' *Yesterday I Asked You (YIAY)*, where he challenges his audience to create content and reviews the output; and *Meme Review*, in which he reviews popular Internet memes.[107] Kjellberg began a book club-styled series,[107] with his own enjoyment with the series also being noted.[107] Kjellberg began *Pew News*, a satirical series where he presents and discusses recent news stories while in-character, often as fictional characters named after CNN hosts, such as Gloria Borger, Poppy Harlow, or Mary Katharine Ham and sometimes, an amalgamation of these names.[108] *Pew News* parodies both mainstream news channels, such as CNN, and YouTube news channels, such as DramaAlert.[108] Topics covered by Kjellberg on *Pew News* included culture war topics he previously avoided.[66]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Kjellberg attracted controversy for using the term \"Twitch thots\" in a video that featured him watching a compilation of female Twitch streamers.[109][110] Alinity, a streamer featured in the video, responded by making a copyright claim against his video, which she stated was later removed by CollabDRM, a company that strikes videos on behalf of creators.[110] Alinity stated that her reaction was caused by \"the rampant sexism in online communities\", arguing that Kjellberg's comments degraded women; she refused to accept Kjellberg's apology.[109][111] In July, Kjellberg posted a meme with singer Demi Lovato's face; the meme jokingly referenced Lovato's struggles with addiction. The meme was posted around the same time Lovato was hospitalized after suffering an opioid overdose. As a result, he received criticism from online users.[112] Kjellberg later deleted the meme, and apologized for the incident.[112]\n\n\nIn a video uploaded in early December, Kjellberg promoted several small content creators on YouTube, recommending his viewers to subscribe to them. Among those creators was \"E;R\", whom Kjellberg highlighted for a video essay on Netflix's *Death Note*.[113] Shortly thereafter, *The Verge*'s Julia Alexander said that the video in question used imagery of the Charlottesville car attack, and that the channel made frequent use of racial and homophobic slurs.[113] In December 2018, *Vox* reported that \"E;R\" also contained white supremacist messaging. After online criticism, he described his posting as an \"oopsie\" and asserted that he had posted it \"recommending someone for their anime review\", rather than any intention to promote antisemitism.[114] Kjellberg said he was largely unaware of E;R's content apart from the *Death Note* video essay, revoked his recommendation of the channel, and edited his video to remove the reference.[113][114]\n\n\nOn 27 December 2018, Kjellberg uploaded \"YouTube Rewind 2018 but it's actually good\", in response to the generally negatively-received *YouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind*, which was originally uploaded by YouTube's Spotlight channel.[115]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: subscriber competition with T-Series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: PewDiePie vs T-Series\n\nIn September 2018, Kjellberg uploaded a *LWIAY* video discussing Indian record label T-Series' YouTube channel being projected to surpass his in subscribers.[116] On 5 October, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track against the label titled \"Tseries Diss Track\", stylized in all caps and later renamed \"Bitch Lasagna\"[117] in response to their YouTube channel being projected to surpass his in subscribers.[118] The video went on to replace \"A Funny Montage\" as Kjellberg's most-viewed video.[119] It included some lines mocking the Indian background of T-Series, which were described as racist in media publications.[120] On the prospect of being surpassed by T-Series in terms of subscriber count, he stated he was not concerned about T-Series, but feared the consequences a corporate channel surpassing him would have for YouTube as a video-sharing platform.[121] Online campaigns to \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" greatly assisted Kjellberg's subscriber growth; his channel gained 6.62 million subscribers in December 2018 alone, compared to the 7 million subscribers gained in all of 2017.[122]\n\n\nOn 12 March, Kjellberg uploaded an episode of his show *Pew News* in which he mentioned the 2019 Pulwama terrorist attack, where 40 Indian paramilitary troops were killed by a member of a Pakistan-based jihadist group. Following the attack, T-Series removed several songs by Pakistani artists on its YouTube channel after being pressurised by political party MNS to isolate Pakistani artists, a course of action that Kjellberg disagreed with.[123][124] The outlet Zee News reported that Kjellberg \"faced strong criticism for his comments on the heightened tension between Pakistan and India in [the] March 12 issue of *Pew News*\".[125] Kjellberg issued a clarification on Twitter, expressing that he was not attempting to speak on the broader India–Pakistan relations, but rather on the more specific context of T-Series removing artists' songs from its YouTube channel.[125]\n\n\nOn 15 March, the perpetrator of the live-streamed Christchurch mosque shootings said \"remember lads, subscribe to PewDiePie\" before carrying out the attacks. In response, Kjellberg tweeted his disgust after having his name associated with the attack, and offered condolences to those affected by the tragedy.[126] Various journalists covering the shooting reported that Kjellberg was not complicit with the shootings.[127] *The New York Times* suggested that Kjellberg's mention in the shootings was a ploy for the news media to attribute blame to Kjellberg, and to otherwise inflame political tensions.[128]\n\n\nAfter briefly gaining the title several times in early 2019, on 27 March, T-Series surpassed Kjellberg in subscribers to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube.[129] On 31 March, Kjellberg posted another diss track music video, titled \"Congratulations\", sarcastically congratulating T-Series for obtaining the title.[130][131][132] In the music video, Kjellberg mocked T-Series and its actions, alleging T-Series was founded to sell pirated songs and mocking them for sending him a cease and desist letter after \"Bitch Lasagna\".[130] Following the video's release, Kjellberg temporarily regained the most-subscribed position over T-Series.[133]\n\n\nOn 9 April, Kjellberg announced that he would live-stream exclusively on streaming service DLive, as part of a deal with the company.[134]\n\n\nOn 11 April, T-Series started to seek court orders to remove Kjellberg's \"diss tracks\" from YouTube.[135][136] The alleged court order was ruled in favor of T-Series. It was allegedly stated that the complaint against Kjellberg claimed that his songs were \"defamatory, disparaging, insulting, and offensive\", and noted that comments on the videos were \"abusive, vulgar, and also racist in nature.\"[137][138][139] Access to the music videos on YouTube was later blocked in India.[139] The two parties were reported to have come to a settlement later that July, although Kjellberg's videos remained blocked in India.[139]\n\n\nOn 28 April, Kjellberg uploaded a video entitled \"Ending the Subscribe to Pewdiepie Meme\" in which he asked his followers to refrain from using the phrase \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\", due to incidents such as the phrase being graffitied on a war memorial, and its mention by the Christchurch mosque shooter.[140][141] While live streaming the following day, Kjellberg showed a plane flying over New York City with a banner attached saying \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\", and called it \"a nice little wrap up\" to the meme.[142]\n\n\n\n### 2019: Nimses, *Minecraft* series, and milestones[edit]\n\n\nThe remainder of 2019 saw further controversies for PewDiePie. In early June, Kjellberg uploaded a video on YouTube sponsored by social media application Nimses.[143] The app spiked in popularity after he promoted it on his YouTube channel. Controversy ensued when Nimses' location features and privacy settings led fans of Kjellberg and fellow YouTubers to believe that he was promoting a privacy-invasive app, with some fans suspecting the app of being a pyramid scheme due to a referral program in the app that offered more in-application currency.[143] The Pirate Party Germany criticized his promotion of Nimses, warning that Kjellberg was promoting a potentially harmful app to a large audience.[143] Andrey Boborykin, the head of marketing and communications at Nimses, published a blog post denying the allegations that the app is privacy-invasive.[143] Kjellberg responded to the allegations in a video, dismissing them as \"rumors\", and claimed that Nimses was no more invasive than other social media apps.[143]\n\n\nDespite being surpassed by T-Series and the aforementioned controversy, Kjellberg continued to achieve high viewership on the site, mainly propelled by a return to consistent gaming uploads. On 21 June, Kjellberg launched *Gaming Week*, where he focused on uploading Let's Play videos every day, for the first time in several years. Among the games played was *Minecraft*, which he was openly surprised by how much he enjoyed playing it. Kjellberg largely centered his videos around *Minecraft* in the following months, with the content featured in his series *Meme Review* and *LWIAY* also becoming focused on the game. Although he had played *Minecraft* earlier in his YouTube career, he had very rarely played it in the following years due to his reluctance to join the trend of *Minecraft* YouTubers, who he felt only played the game because of its popularity rather than for their enjoyment.[144][145]\n\n\nThis transition was largely successful for Kjellberg, who received a large increase in views, achieving over 570 million views during the month of July, the most views received by the channel in a month since at least October 2016. His daily number of new subscribers grew from 25,000 to 45,000 during that month.[144] Despite this success, Kjellberg insisted that he played the game for his enjoyment, and did not want to become solely a \"*Minecraft* YouTuber\", stating, \"If *Minecraft* gets boring, I can just move on to other things.\"[145]\n\n\nOn 25 August, Kjellberg became the first individual YouTuber to surpass 100 million subscribers. His channel was the second overall to reach the milestone, after T-Series, who passed the mark earlier in the year.[146] YouTube tweeted a congratulatory post to note the occurrence,[147] and awarded him a Red Diamond Play Button.[3] In December, Kjellberg was acknowledged as the most-viewed creator of the year, with more than 4 billion views in 2019.[148]\n\n\n\n### 2019–2020: China ban, brief breaks, and content deals[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Kjellberg stated in a video that his YouTube content, as well as content related to him on other websites such as Reddit, had been blocked in China.[149] He explained that this was due to his comments about the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, and an image of Chinese president Xi Jinping being compared to Winnie the Pooh shown in a previous video.[149]\n\n\nIn November, *Business Insider* reported Kjellberg as a client of Re6l, a Toronto-based influencer media and ecommerce company.[150] In December, Kjellberg announced that he would take a break from YouTube the following year, and deleted his Twitter account because of his dissatisfaction with the site.[151][152]\n\n\nKjellberg's hiatus ultimately proved to be brief, lasting a little over a month during early 2020.[153] Taking short breaks from creating online content proved to become a behavior he would repeat throughout the following years.[154][155][156]\n\n\nIn his first video uploaded following his 2020 hiatus, Kjellberg made jokes about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spoke in mock-Chinese phrases. After receiving criticism for these jokes, Kjellberg uploaded another video in which he made more jokes about COVID-19, and defended the jokes he made in his previous video.[157]\n\n\nKjellberg signed an exclusive deal to stream on YouTube in May, as the platform was enrolling high-profile streamers to rival competitors like Twitch and Mixer.[158] At the time of signing with YouTube, Kjellberg had amassed over 800,000 followers on DLive, but due to his deal with the former, and not having streamed on the latter in four months, *Tubefilter* noted that it was unclear if Kjellberg was still affiliated with DLive.[159] Kjellberg's DLive channel was eventually deactivated.[160]\n\n\nIn October, Kjellberg's fans began to suspect his channel was shadowbanned, after noticing it and his recent uploads failed to appear in YouTube's search results.[161] YouTube responded to the shadowban allegations on Twitter, claiming that the reason for the problems was due to search results being influenced by YouTube's system somehow flagging his recent uploads, and that due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube was taking longer to review videos, including Kjellberg's.[161] YouTube apologized for the situation and stated they were \"working on fixing the issue.\"[161]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: soft retirement and move to Japan[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"YouTube actually has become fun again for the past two years. And that's when I realized, why should I quit? It's my dream after all to do YouTube. I've worked so hard for this.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n –Felix Kjellberg, September 2022 (relating to his soft retirement from YouTube)[162]\n\nIn November, Kjellberg uploaded a Q&A video, reflecting on his YouTube career. During the video, he expressed that he views himself as \"retired\" from YouTube, having felt so internally since earlier in the year.[‡ 8][162] He continued to upload videos fairly frequently on the platform afterwards, albeit, inconsistently.[162] He also \"committed to posting more unstructured content, like vlogs.\"[163]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Kjellberg signed a distribution deal with Jellysmack, a content creation company.[164] The deal entails Jellysmack optimizing and then distributing Kjellberg's content for a Facebook Watch audience.[164] Although now having his content released onto the Facebook platform, Kjellberg continued to debut his content on YouTube.[164]\n\n\nOn 14 February, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track titled \"Coco\" about Cocomelon, a kids-oriented channel which had been rising in subscribers for several years, and was growing by nearly two million subscribers per month.[165] Kjellberg clarified that the children appearing in the music video were provided with a clean version of the lyrics to mime to while they were being filmed, and that their parents allowed them to participate in the video.[166] The video was later taken down by YouTube who claimed that it violated their policies on harassment and child safety.[166] Kjellberg stated he \"[didn't] actually care about Cocomelon\" and did not want the pretend-rivalry with the channel to \"get out of control\", as his rivalry with T-Series had previously.[166]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Kjellberg and his wife Marzia moved from England to Japan. Much of his content following the move centered around \"vlogs about daily life around Tokyo.\"[167] In September, Kjellberg explained the shift his upload philosophy underwent when he announced his \"retirement\" from the platform: he opted to share videos for fun, as he did when he first began uploading videos.[162]\n\n\nOn 14 November, MrBeast surpassed Kjellberg as the most-subscribed individual creator on YouTube.[168][169] The two have been noted as contemporaries and friends, with MrBeast having previously supported the 'Subscribe to PewDiePie' campaign during Kjellberg's competition with T-Series.[163] Previously, Kjellberg answered a viewer question relating to whether MrBeast would surpass his subscriber count, replying \"He definitely will ... He definitely deserves it, I hope he does it.\"[163][170]\n\n\nAfter years of inactivity, Kjellberg's Twitch account began streaming episodes of the Canadian sitcom *Trailer Park Boys* in March 2023. This was part of a test by the distribution and monetization service CoPilot Media, as they were on the verge of rolling out \"PewDiePie Infinity\", \"essentially an endless loop of [Kjellberg]'s videos.\"[171] On 9 May, Kjellberg's Twitch account received a ban despite only streaming this previously aired content.[171] On 29 June, Kjellberg announced he would be taking an indefinite hiatus from YouTube due to his imminent fatherhood.[172]\n\n\n\n## YouTube content[edit]\n\n\nSee also: PewDiePie videography\n\n### Style[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his career, Kjellberg's content mainly consisted of Let's Play videos.[173] His commentaries of horror games made up his best-known content during this early stage, although he eventually expanded into other genres.[22] Unlike conventional walkthroughs, Kjellberg devoted his Let's Play videos to communicating more personally with his audience.[174] *Variety* detailed that Kjellberg \"acts like he's spending time with a friend. He begins each video introducing himself in a high-pitched, goofy voice, drawing out the vowels of his YouTube moniker, then delves into the videos.\"[173]\n\n\nKnown for his idiosyncratic sense of humor, the nature of his video content has been described by various outlets as goofy, energetic, and obnoxious,[29][175][176][177] yet genuine and unfiltered.[70][175] Lev Grossman of *Time* noted that \"he's totally unpolished, but at the same time his timing is consistently spot-on,\" adding that \"most of the critical literature about PewDiePie focuses on the bad language and crude physical humor–and admittedly there are a lot of both–and the fact that he is, at the end of the day, just a guy playing video games and yelling.\"[177] Rob Walker of Yahoo! wrote Kjellberg's \"chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments, and pretty much nonstop profanity.\"[175] Occasionally, Kjellberg resorts to just gameplay, resulting in silent or emotional commentary;[175] his playthrough of *The Last of Us*, was detailed to leave the usually vocal gamer speechless at its ending.[178]\n\n\nWith his channel's growth, Kjellberg's content has become more diverse; in addition to traditional Let's Play videos, he has uploaded content including vlogs, comedy shorts, and formatted shows.[13] Toward the end of the 2010s, he began uploading much reaction-style content, such as his late 2018 and early 2019 videos reacting to various compilations of TikTok videos.[179][180] Kjellberg has also uploaded music onto his channel, often accompanied by animation, fan art, or live footage. Oftentimes, music videos uploaded onto his channel are collaborative in nature, as has worked with artists such as The Gregory Brothers (also known as Schmoyoho), Boyinaband, Roomie, and Party In Backyard.[181][182][183]\n\n\n\n### Production and output[edit]\n\n\nDuring the early portion of his YouTube career, Kjellberg did not hire any editor or outside assistance to help with his video output, stating he wanted \"YouTube to be YouTube.\"[48] While his early videos would simply feature raw footage, he later began to dedicate time to edit his videos.[74] Swedish magazine *Icon* noted his use of the Adobe Premiere Pro editing software.[59] On separate occasions, he later sought an editor and a production assistant to help with his content creation.[184][185] Although now having an editor for his videos, in a 2017 video, he maintained that \"I'm just a guy. It's literally just me. There's not a producer out there [...] there's no writer, there's no camera guy.\"[‡ 7] In July of that same year, Kjellberg commented that a couple of months prior, he had an office and a limited number of employees assisting him with his content creation.[‡ 9]\n\n\nKjellberg has been noted by both himself and media outlets as prolific on the platform, having uploaded videos with a high frequency.[48] By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 of which have been made private.[‡ 10] As a result, Kjellberg has made videos and statements expressing his feelings of burnout from frequently creating content for the platform and its effect on his mental health.[186][187] In March 2017, Kjellberg commented that his channel was running on a daily output, stating, \"[there's] a lot of challenges in doing daily content, [...] but I still really, really love the daily challenge—the daily grind—of just being like, 'hey, I'm gonna make a video today, no matter what.' And sometimes it really works, and sometimes it doesn't.\"[‡ 11]\n\n\n\n### Subscribers and viewership[edit]\n\n\n> \n> An interesting note about Kjellberg's rise to fame: he never really had a video go viral. He just ground it out, slow and steady, growing subscriber by subscriber.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n –Lev Grossman, *Time* (2016)[177]\n\nMedia writers have noted that Kjellberg's content has been largely built up \"methodically,\"[176] as opposed to him having risen to fame through a viral video.[177][176] At the same time, the growth of Kjellberg's channel has been described as rapid by various sources; Douglas Holt of the *Harvard Business Review* commented that \"the power of crowdculture propelled [Kjellberg] to global fame and influence in record time.\"[188] Many close to Kjellberg have described him as \"steadfastly loyal to his YouTube audience,\" with one calling him \"a little spectrumy\" in this regard.[47]\n\n\nBy December 2011, Kjellberg's channel had around 60,000 subscribers,[16] and on 9 May 2012, it reached 500,000 subscribers.[189] In March 2012, Swedish newspaper *Expressen* reported that Kjellberg had uploaded at least one video per day for the seven months preceding their report. Additionally, the publication noted that Kjellberg's channel accumulated 71 million total video views to that point and 25 million video views in February 2012 alone.[190] The channel reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012,[8] and 2 million subscribers in September.[19]\n\n\nThroughout 2012 and 2013, Kjellberg's channel was one of the fastest-growing on YouTube, in terms of subscribers gained.[45] In 2013, the channel grew from 3.5 million to just under 19 million subscribers,[191] and by the end of 2013, it was gaining a new subscriber every 1.037 seconds.[192] *Billboard* reported that the channel gained more subscribers than any other channel in 2013.[46] In June 2013, *Tubefilter* began a monthly listing of the most viewed YouTube channels. In 2013, Kjellberg was consistently toward the top of this listing, ranking #1 in June, July, August, October, and December of that year.[193] Analyzing *Tubefilter*'s data, *The Guardian* reported that Kjellberg's channel earned 1.3 billion video views in the second half of 2013.[194] The channel had two of the ten most-viewed gaming videos in 2013: the sixth-part of his *Mad Father* Let's Play was the third-most viewed of the year, earning 27 million views, and an entry in his *Funny Gaming Montage* series ranked as the eight-most viewed gaming video of 2013.[195]\n\n\nOn 18 February 2013, Kjellberg's channel reached 5 million subscribers,[16] and in April, he was covered in *The New York Times* after surpassing 6 million subscribers.[31] Many of Kjellberg's most-viewed videos are highlight compilations of his Let's Play videos.[182][196] One of these compilations, \"A Funny Montage\", was uploaded in June 2013, and spent a considerable amount of time as Kjellberg's most-viewed, with publications citing it as such through 2018.[197][198]\n\n\nIn July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second-most-subscribed YouTube user,[35] and reached 10 million subscribers on 9 July.[16][36] Kjellberg's subscriber count surpassed that of the leading channel, Smosh, on 15 August 2013.[39] On 31 October 2013, his channel became the first to reach 15 million subscribers.[199] Shortly after, PewDiePie was surpassed by YouTube's Spotlight channel in subscribers.[41] After jostling for the top position during the next month, PewDiePie's channel took firm hold of the most-subscribed title on 23 December.[200] On 9 January 2014, the channel reached the 20 million subscriber milestone.[201]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kjellberg's channel was the most-viewed in January, and then for seven consecutive months from March to September.[202] In August 2014, *Tubefilter* reported that the channel surpassed the Rihanna VEVO channel on 19 July as the most-viewed on YouTube at around 5.2 billion video views.[203] Data from Social Blade, however, shows that the channel still had less video views than the emimusic channel.[204] According to their data, the channel surpassed emimusic on 29 December 2014, at over 7.2 billion views, to become the most-viewed channel on the website.[205][206] According to *Tubefilter* and *The Guardian*, the channel amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers and around 4.1 billion video views in 2014; both figures were higher than any other user.[62][63] The latter figure was a reported 81% increase from the channel's video views in 2013; the channel was the most viewed in that year, as well.[62]\n\n\nDuring July 2015, his videos were documented to receive over 300 million views per month.[207] It eclipsed the 10 billion video view milestone on 6 September 2015, becoming the first channel to do so.[11][67][208] At that time, \"A Funny Montage\" (then-titled \"Funny Montage #1\") was Kjellberg's most-viewed video, with approximately 68.8 million views; a partial reason it accumulated many views was due to its status as the PewDiePie channel trailer.[67] In 2016, the channel experienced decreased viewership, which was similarly experienced by other content creators across the platform, due to changes in YouTube's algorithm.[83] On 8 December, it reached 50 million subscribers, becoming the first YouTube channel to do so.[79]\n\n\nOnline campaigns to \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" greatly assisted Kjellberg's subscriber growth; his channel gained 6.62 million subscribers in December 2018 alone, compared to the 7 million subscribers gained in all of 2017.[122] Renewed interest in Kjellberg's videos due to his subscriber competition with T-Series resulted in his channel earning over 500 million video views in December 2018, which was then the channel's single-highest monthly view count.[209] After briefly gaining the title several times in early 2019, on 27 March, T-Series surpassed Kjellberg in subscribers to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube.[129] The day after \"Congratulations\" was uploaded, Kjellberg temporarily regained his lead over T-Series as the most subscribed channel.[133]\n\n\nIn July 2019, in large part due to Kjellberg's *Minecraft* gameplay videos, his channel surged in video views. *The Verge* noted that it was Kjellberg's most successful month in years, in terms of viewership.[141] Data from Social Blade[d] shows the channel received 573 million video views, a then-single-month record amount of views for Kjellberg's channel.[210] Kjellberg was the most-viewed creator of 2019, with his channel receiving over 4 billion views during the year.[148]\n\n\nAlong with T-Series, the PewDiePie channel is one of only two on YouTube to receive all five tiers of YouTube Creator Awards: Silver, Gold, Diamond, Custom, and Red Diamond Creator. These awards are earned upon surpassing the 100,000; 1 million; 10 million; 50 million; and 100 million subscriber milestones, respectively.[211] Kjellberg nicknamed his Custom Creator Award the Ruby Play Button, which he received in 2016.[2] In 2019, Kjellberg's channel became the second overall, and the first run by an individual creator, to receive the Red Diamond Creator Award.[212]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's YouTube content has been met with mixed critical reception. Media outlets write that he is one of the most popular creators online, despite being involved in multiple media controversies.[213][214][215] His content has been described by various outlets as goofy, energetic, and filled with profanity,[29][175][177][176] and his on-camera personality has been generally received as genuine, unfiltered, and self-aware by various outlets.[70][175] Kjellberg's content has also been received negatively by the media, with detractors describing it as \"obnoxious\" and often reporting his popularity as an \"inexplicable phenomenon\".[22][176] Rob Walker of *Yahoo!* has commented positively on Kjellberg's intelligence, stating Kjellberg is \"clearly\" smart based on when he speaks directly to his audience.[175] Other outlets, such as *Time* and *The Verge*, have written similar sentiments, describing Kjellberg as \"articulate\" and \"self conscious\", respectively.[70][177] In contrast, Andrew Wallenstein of *Variety* heavily criticised Kjellberg, following his channel becoming the most-subscribed on YouTube, describing his videos as \"aggressive stupidity\" and \"psychobabble.\"[176]\n\n\nLev Grossman of *Time* noted that \"he's totally unpolished, but at the same time his timing is consistently spot-on,\" adding that \"most of the critical literature about PewDiePie focuses on the bad language and crude physical humor–and admittedly there are a lot of both–and the fact that he is, at the end of the day, just a guy playing video games and yelling.\"[177] Walker wrote Kjellberg's \"chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments, and pretty much nonstop profanity.\"[175] Justin Charity of *The Ringer* stated, \"PewDiePie isn't a comedian in any conventional sense,\" but described his \"hosting style [as] loopy and irreverent in the extreme: He's a little bit stand-up, a little bit shock jock, a little bit 4chan bottom-feeder.\"[216]\n\n\nIn regards to his early Let's Play content, Swedish columnist Lars Lindstrom commented positively, stating that \"Felix Kjellberg [having] a comic talent is indisputable. It is both amazingly awful and amazingly funny when a father bikes around with his son in the game *Happy Wheels* and both get crushed and bloody again and again and PewDiePie improvises absurd comments as the game continues. The secret is that he loves to play these games and that he has fun doing it.\"[15] As his content went through changes in style in 2016, Patricia Hernandez of *Kotaku* wrote, \"the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, as he describes the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand.\"[75]\n\n\nFollowing the controversy regarding alleged antisemitic content in his videos, many media publications both in and outside of the gaming and tech industries severely criticised Kjellberg's content. These outlets suggested that Kjellberg's content contained and promoted fascist, white supremacist, and alt-right ideologies.[89][90][217] A *Wired* article covering the controversy referred to him as a \"poster boy for white supremacists\".[217] Charity opined that Kjellberg's \"occasional, reactionary irreverence has become a core component of his appeal. Likewise, for critics and fans who value inclusivity — and among outside observers who view [Kjellberg]'s conduct as inexplicably frequent in the news — [Kjellberg] represents all that is wrong and alienating about games culture.\"[216]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, \"Congratulations\" and \"Bitch Lasagna\" were banned in India when the Delhi High Court granted an injunction in favor of T-Series.[136][137] The complaint against Kjellberg allegedly stated that his songs were \"defamatory, disparaging, insulting, and offensive,\" and noted that comments on the videos were \"abusive, vulgar, and also racist in nature.\"[137][139][218] Although both parties came to a settlement later in the year, Kjellberg's videos remain blocked in India.[139]\n\n\nOn 16 October 2019, Kjellberg uploaded an episode of his *Meme Review* series, in which he reacted to memes about the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests.[219] The video also featured his commentary on the China–NBA issue and the Blitzchung controversy, as well as memes comparing Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping to Winnie-the-Pooh.[219][220] As a result, Kjellberg's channel and content were reportedly censored in China.[219][220] The BBC wrote that instead of a complete ban, only \"some content related to the YouTuber has indeed been made inaccessible online,\" and that \"there is no evidence to suggest this was done on the orders of the government.\"[221] The BBC suggested that Baidu seemingly removed PewDiePie-related messages on a forum out of caution, but that \"a [Baidu] search for his name still returns more than eight million results.\"[221] *Vox* wrote that \"access to reposted PewDiePie videos and music\" appeared to be available to some regional users.[219]\n\n\nAccording to *Business Insider*, \"For years, critics of Pewds have been campaigning for YouTube to bar him from the platform to no avail.\"[157]\n\n\n\n## Public image and influence[edit]\n\n\nSince breaking through on YouTube with his Let's Play-styled videos, Kjellberg has emerged as one of the most noted, influential, and controversial online personalities. He has also been cited by various publications as largely influential for digital content creation and Internet culture, particularly relating to video gaming subcultures. *Eurogamer* noted that Kjellberg was cast by media reports as a \"figurehead\" of YouTubers, and for being nearly synonymous with gaming YouTubers in general.[213] In 2016, Douglas Holt of *Harvard Business Review* wrote of Kjellberg as \"YouTube's greatest success\", and regarded him, about gaming subcultures, \"the star of this digital art world—just as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Patti Smith had done in urban art worlds back in the analog days\".[188] Lev Grossman of *Time* wrote that Kjellberg dominated \"an entire medium single-handed,\" and pioneered \"a new form of fame not controlled or manufactured by a studio or a network.\"[177]\n\n\nKjellberg has stated that he dislikes being called \"famous\".[222] In a 2014 interview with *The Wall Street Journal*, he called the influence he has \"kind of scary\".[47] In a *Rolling Stone* article, Kjellberg admitted to being shocked by his fame; he recalled a gaming event near his hometown, stating \"I remember there were five security guards yelling at a crowd to back up – it was out of control. It was shocking to find myself in that situation, where I was that celebrity person.\"[13] In a 2019 interview with the *New York Times*, Kjellberg commented on his influence stating, \"it's weird for me to be in this position because I don't really want to be in this position.\"[66] He went on to express feelings of nostalgia for his early YouTube career, when he had fewer subscribers, and admitted to periodically thinking about giving up the platform altogether.[66] Colleagues and media have referred to Kjellberg as \"normally press shy\", \"quiet\", and \"much more reserved in real life.\"[47][222] After moving to Japan, Kjellberg expressed enjoying a lack of recognition while in public.[167][‡ 12]\n\n\n\n### As a YouTube personality[edit]\n\n\n#### After becoming the most-subscribed[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Rob Walker of *Yahoo!* called Kjellberg's popularity \"insane\", writing that it \"strikes me as considerably more curious – I mean, you know who Rihanna is, but would you recognize this kid if he was standing in line behind you at the bank?\"[175] Walker, among other reporters, has questioned and analysed reasons for his popularity.[175][176][177] Walker commented on Kjellberg's interaction with his audience, writing, \"While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly more than willing to make fun of himself in the process.\"[175]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ross Miller of *The Verge* wrote, \"Love it or hate it, his success – like so many other YouTube personalities – isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record.\"[223] Writing about and analyzing Kjellberg's career, Kevin Roose of *The New York Times* wrote that during the period in which Kjellberg had the most-subscribed channel but prior to his alleged antisemitism controversy, \"[Kjellberg] was not just the YouTuber with the biggest channel. To many Inner YouTubers, he represented the values of the platform — lo-fi, authentic, defiantly weird.\"[66]\n\n\n\n#### Following media controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn the wake of the *Wall Street Journal* controversy, John Herman of *The New York Times* commented that \"[Kjellberg] bemoaned [YouTube's] structure and the way it had changed; he balked at its limits and took joy in causing offense and flouting rules. Over time, he grew into an unlikely, disorienting, and insistently unserious political identity: He became YouTube's very own populist reactionary.\"[224] YouTube's chief business officer Robert Kyncl stated Kjellberg \"underestimated the responsibility he had as the platform's most popular ambassador, even if he himself is not a hateful person.\"[47]\n\n\nIn 2018, Paul MacInnes of *The Guardian* wrote, \"Given the scale of his audience and his influence, not much is written about PewDiePie. Tech sites like *The Verge* and *Polygon* report on him and often critique him severely. But in the mainstream media, his name has broken through only either as a result of novelty or scandal,\" and noted that his content was rarely written about.[225] Touching on Kjellberg's alleged antisemitic controversy, MacInnes also added that he \"is funny, intelligent, innovative and highly charismatic [...] to call him an alt-right agitator would perhaps be unfair as he has never publicly identified with the proto-fascist movement. But he shares much of their culture and amplifies it across the world. People should pay PewDiePie more attention.\"[225]\n\n\nMax Read of *Intelligencer* retrospectively opined on Kjellberg's alleged antisemitic controversy, commenting that \"Kjellberg, for his part, is seen as a standard-bearer for the oppressed YouTuber subject to the whims of YouTube's corporate masters — a symbol of the ongoing tension between YouTube and the culture that it spawned,\" and added that \"he, through fights over his behavior and his position within the YouTube space, is something like a gateway drug to bigger political battles over free speech, the role of media, and diversity.\"[226]\n\n\nShortly prior to his 2020 hiatus, Erin Nyren of *Variety* commented that Kjellberg's \"popularity continues unabated in spite of—or perhaps because of—the fact that he has been the subject of ongoing controversies.\"[214]\n\n\n\n### Media lists and rankings[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's influence has ranked highly on various lists. Subtitled as the \"King of YouTube\" on *The Verge*'s 2014 \"Verge 50\" list—the outlet's \"definitive list of the most interesting people building the future.\" On his listing's blurb, *The Verge* wrote that \"Kjellberg's real talent is finding the human within games. He's just a normal person, finding the authentic in games for an audience that are desperate for a little more humanity.\"[227] In 2015, Kjellberg was included on *Time*'s list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, with the publication writing that his channel \"broadcasts some of the most-watched programs in pop culture.\"[228] Later in 2015, Kjellberg was featured on the cover of *Variety*'s \"Famechangers\" issue, with the magazine ranking him as the \"#1 Famechanger\", or \"those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest\".[229]\n\n\nThe following year, *Time* included him on their *Time 100* list, with *South Park* co-creator Trey Parker writing in his entry, \"I know it might seem weird, especially to those of us from an older generation, that people would spend so much time watching someone else play video games [...] But I choose to see it as the birth of a new art form. And I don't think anyone should underestimate its most powerful artist.\"[230] *Forbes* wrote that \"[Kjellberg's] overall brand suffered earlier this year [2017] when he included antisemitic content in nine of his videos,\" when citing their reason for not ranking him as the top gaming influence.[231] *Forbes* still included Kjellberg in the gaming category of their June 2017 \"Top Influencers\" list.[232] In September 2019, *The Sunday Times* ranked him first on their list of the UK's 100 most influential people online.[233][234]\n\n\n\n### Channel demographics[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's channel appeals strongly to younger viewers, a group Google refers to as \"Generation C\" for their habits of \"creation, curation, connection and community\".[17][174] This demographic has been more commonly referred to as Generation Z by researchers and popular media. In a 2017 video, Kjellberg shared a screenshot of data provided by YouTube regarding his channel statistics, which suggested his largest demographic was among the 18–24 age group, followed by the 25–34 age group.[225] Surveys conducted throughout the 2010s highlighted that favorable opinions of Kjellberg, as well as his name recognition and online influence within these age ranges, was comparable to that of mainstream figures such as Jennifer Lawrence, Justin Bieber, and LeBron James.[235][236]\n\n\n*The New York Times* published results of an online reader poll the publication held, showing that only 17% of their digital readers correctly identified Kjellberg after seeing an image of him; the outlet wrote that the poll's results \"probably reflect the fact that *Times* readers are older than a representative sample of Americans, citing that \"in 2015, the median digital *Times* subscriber was 54 years old.\"[237] In 2016, Maker Studios' international chief content officer was cited in *The Guardian* as comparing \"the average parent's bafflement at their teenage children's passion for stars like PewDiePie, KSI, and Zoella to past generations' inability to comprehend punk rock or gangsta rap.\"[238]\n\n\nStudies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of video game players engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to being an important reason for Kjellberg's popularity.[239]\n\n\n\n### Fan base[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fans demonstrate in Tallinn during the PewDiePie vs T-Series subscriber competition.\n*ESPN* noted in 2015 that Kjellberg typically performed a \"Brofist\" gesture at the end of his videos,[16] and often referred to his fan base as the \"Bro Army\", addressing his audience as \"bros\".[240] Likewise, media outlets also adopted the name when referring to Kjellberg's fan base.[16][241][242] Later in his YouTube career, Kjellberg stopped using the term \"Bro Army\", and began to refer to his audience as \"Squad Fam\", \"9 year olds\", and later \"19 year olds\", in his videos.[243] The fan base has been subject to criticism; in July 2018, *Wired* published an article, referring to Kjellberg's fan base as \"toxic\", stating that \"it's not just that they've stuck with the Swedish gamer/alleged comedian as he peppered his videos with racial slurs, rape jokes, antisemitism, and homophobia for nearly a decade (though that's bad enough). It's also that they insist that PewDiePie somehow isn't being hateful at all.\"[242]\n\n\nAt the 2013 Social Star Awards in Singapore, Kjellberg greeted his fans personally despite security warning him against doing so.[17][244] Kjellberg also mentioned this event to *Rolling Stone*, stating, \"I didn't even understand they were screaming for me at first.\"[13] Kjellberg has commented on fans from Malaysia and Singapore; during a trip to Kuala Lumpur in 2016, fans entered his hotel to search for him, which he expressed annoyance with.[245] In a 2019 vlog, Kjellberg expressed that fans in Malaysia and Singapore can be \"very hectic and scream-ish and crazy, and they lose their minds when they see you.\"[245] He later apologized to fans from the two countries, stating that seeing the effect he had \"on fans back then [during his 2013 trip to Singapore] was cool\" and that he would \"be lying\" if he claimed to hate this initial experience with fans, although added that he has grown to not enjoy being treated as more than a person.[245] *Business Insider Singapore* reported that some fans took offense to Kjellberg's comments, but that \"most netizens accepted the YouTuber's apology and admitted that fans had gone overboard in invading his privacy.\"[245]\n\n\nRelating to his responsibility to his audience, Kjellberg has stated, \"many people see me as a friend they can chill with for 15 minutes a day,\" adding, \"The loneliness in front of the computer screens brings us together. But I never set out to be a role model; I just want to invite them to come over to my place.\"[59] Correlating with this note, his audience has been reported to provide positive remarks about him; some of his viewers created and contributed to a thread expressing that he has made them happier and feel better about themselves.[22] Conversely, during an informal Twitter poll conducted by one *Kotaku* reporter, respondents described him as \"annoying\" and an \"obnoxious waste of time.\"[22] Additionally, *Rolling Stone* has documented the existence of several Reddit threads dedicated to sharing disparaging views of Kjellberg.[13]\n\n\n\n### Influence on video games[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg has been noted to support video games from indie developers, often having played through such titles in his videos.[19][246] His commentaries have had a positive effect on sales of indie games, with *The Washington Post* writing that \"gamemakers have observed a kind of Oprah effect.\"[11][239][247] The developers of the indie game *McPixel* stated, \"The largest force driving attention to *McPixel* at that time were 'Let's Play' videos. Mostly by Jesse Cox and PewDiePie.\"[248] Kjellberg has also been confirmed to have driven the popularity of *Yandere Simulator* during that game's development,[249][250] and positively influenced the sales of *Slender: The Eight Pages* and *Goat Simulator*.[22][59] Although games being featured on Kjellberg's channel have reportedly contributed to their commercial success, he has stated, \"I just want to play the games, not influence sales.\"[251]\n\n\nIn 2019, Kjellberg's *Minecraft* videos led a surge of interest towards the game, which saw an increase in players. It also registered the largest-trending score on YouTube since January 2017 and surpassed *Fortnite* as the most-searched game on YouTube, with the searches for *Minecraft* on Google almost doubling since previous months.[144][145] Video game media outlets, such as *Polygon* and *The Verge*, largely credited this newfound success to Kjellberg, with *The Verge* suggesting that the surge \"proves that the 'PewDiePie Effect' is still real\" (about the Oprah effect-like success enjoyed by games Kjellberg has played).[144] Several other popular YouTubers followed suit by focusing on *Minecraft* content.[144] *Polygon* also noted that in the wake of Kjellberg's focus on *Minecraft*, YouTubers focused on *Fortnite* began to shift towards making *Minecraft* videos instead.[145]\n\n\nKjellberg, along with characters from *Amnesia: The Dark Descent*, were referred to by a *McPixel* level designed in his honour.[252] Additionally, in the video game *Surgeon Simulator 2013*, the Alien Surgery stage features an organ called \"Pewdsball\" in honour of Kjellberg.[253][254] Kjellberg agreed to allow the developers of *Surgeon Simulator 2013* to use his likeness in *GOTY IDST*, a showering simulation video game.[255][256] Kjellberg was also included as an NPC in the indie game *Party Hard*,[257] and had a voice acting role in *Pinstripe*, a puzzle adventure game.[258]\n\n\n\n### Income[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2014, Kjellberg made an estimated $140,000–$1.4 million from YouTube revenue, according to Social Blade.[259] In June 2014, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Kjellberg earned $4 million in 2013;[260][261] Kjellberg confirmed on Reddit that the figures were somewhat close to what he actually earned.[59] In July 2015, the Swedish newspaper *Expressen* reported that Kjellberg's production company, PewDie Productions AB, reported earnings of 63.7 million SEK ($7.5 million) in 2014.[262][263] In 2015, outlets described Kjellberg's income as sizeable, and even \"remarkable\";[264] Kjellberg appeared at the top of *Forbes*' October 2015 list of the richest YouTube stars with a reported $12 million earned in 2015.[265]\n\n\nIn December 2016, *Forbes* named Kjellberg as the highest-earning YouTuber with his annual income reaching $15 million.[266] This was up 20% from 2015, largely due to his YouTube Red series *Scare PewDiePie* and his book *This Book Loves You*, which sold over 112,000 copies according to Nielsen Bookscan.[267] Kjellberg relies on external revenue sources rather than YouTube's ad model, which he has stated is common for most YouTube content creators; Kjellberg commented that YouTube's ad revenue model is inefficient, unstable, and insecure.[268] According to *Forbes*, Kjellberg's income dropped to $12 million in 2017, which made him the sixth highest-paid YouTuber during that year.[269] *Forbes* commented that Kjellberg's income would have been higher had he avoided the pushback from advertisers resulting from the controversies surrounding his videos in 2017.[270]\n\n\nExtensive media coverage on his earnings has been met with frustration by Kjellberg, who has stated that he is \"tired of talking about how much [he makes]\",[271] and suggested that media outlets should rather report on the money he raised for charity.[272] *The Guardian* commented that the reason the media was so captivated by Kjellberg's earnings is that the topic \"offers a rare insight into the money being made at the top end of YouTube stardom,\" adding \"it's very rare for any YouTube creator to talk about their earnings publicly, not least because YouTube itself does not encourage it.\"[18]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Video games, authorship and fashion design[edit]\n\n\nOn 24 September 2015, Kjellberg released his own video game, *PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist*, on iOS and Android. The game was developed by Canadian game developer Outerminds in collaboration with Kjellberg.[273][274] On 29 September 2016, he released another game developed by Outerminds, *PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator*.[275] It was released as a free app on iOS and Android devices and reached the number one spot on the App Store within a few days of its release.[241][275] On 31 October 2017, former *Goat Simulator* developer and lead designer Armin Ibrisagic announced his partnership with Kjellberg for his video game *Animal Super Squad*.[276] Kjellberg helped Ibrisagic with the core concept of the game and provided him with feedback and creative direction.[276] In 2019, Kjellberg released two more video games: *PewDiePie's Pixelings* on 15 November and *Poopdie* on 12 December.[277][278] The latter game was rejected from the App Store due to its \"crude imagery and sound effects which may disgust users\", but is available on Android.[278]\n\n\nPenguin Group's Razorbill imprint released Kjellberg's *This Book Loves You*, a parody of self-help books, on 20 October 2015.[69] The book is a collection of anti-proverbs paired with visuals.[279] It was number-one on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for two weeks in the Young Adult Paperback category.[280][281] Kjellberg and his wife Marzia launched Tsuki, a unisex clothing brand which they announced in a YouTube video.[282]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in April 2014 and spanning into August, Kjellberg, along with his then-girlfriend Marzia, began a marketing campaign for the Legendary Pictures film *As Above, So Below*.[283][284] Kjellberg's videos for the marketing campaign included a miniseries featuring him participating in the \"Catacombs Challenge\". The challenge involved Kjellberg searching for three keys in the catacombs to open a container holding \"the Philosopher's stone\".[285] The couple's videos were able to earn nearly 20 million views.[286] Maker Studios, which both Kjellberg and Marzia were represented by, brokered the ad deal between the two and Legendary Pictures.[285] In January 2015, Mountain Dew partnered with Kjellberg to launch a fan fiction contest, in which winning fan fiction will be animated into video formats and then uploaded onto his channel.[287]\n\n\nWhile he entered partnerships early in his YouTube career, Kjellberg maintained that he worked with few brands and conducted few promotions.[59][288] He stated he felt he made enough money from YouTube and found endorsing too many brands to be disrespectful to his fans.[289] On this topic, Kjellberg has expressed disappointment when a sizable portion of people misinterpret his intentions; he stated, \"if I mention on Twitter that I find this or that Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it.\"[59] Eventually, Kjellberg began to work with more brands, stating that he wanted to have a genuine relationship with brands and added he was lucky to not be dependent on working with them to support his career.[‡ 13] In January 2019, Kjellberg announced a partnership with energy drink company G Fuel.[‡ 14]\n\n\n\n### Appearances in other media[edit]\n\n\nAside from his own YouTube channel, Kjellberg has made appearances in the videos of other YouTube creators. In April 2013, he made a cameo in an episode of *Epic Rap Battles of History*, portraying Mikhail Baryshnikov.[290] In July 2013, he starred alongside Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox of Smosh, as well as Jenna Marbles, as guest judges on the second season of *Internet Icon*.[291] Kjellberg also appeared in YouTube's annual year-end *Rewind* series each year from 2013 to 2016;[292][293][294][295] he once again appeared in *YouTube Rewind* in 2019.[296]\n\n\nOn 3 June 2014, Sveriges Radio announced that Kjellberg was chosen to host his own episode of the Swedish radio show *Sommar i P1*.[297] Due to his international popularity, the episode was recorded in both Swedish and English. The Swedish version was broadcast on 9 August 2014 on Sveriges Radio P1, and when the broadcast started the English version was published online.[298][299] The link to the Swedish version of the broadcast was shared over 3,500 times, and the link to the English version was shared about 49,000 times.[300]\n\n\nIn December 2014, Kjellberg guest-starred in two episodes of the 18th season of *South Park.* The two episodes served as a two-part season finale. The first part, titled \"#REHASH\" aired on 3 December, while the second part, titled \"#HappyHolograms\", aired on 10 December.[301][302] In the episodes, he parodied himself and other Let's Play commentators, providing commentary over *Call of Duty* gameplay in an overly expressive way.[301]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Kjellberg was announced as a voice actor in the Vimeo fantasy series, *Oscar's Hotel for Fantastical Creatures*.[303] In October of the same year, he appeared as a guest on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,*[304] where Colbert referred to him as \"Emperor of the Internet\".[305] In February 2016, he appeared on *Conan*, playing *Far Cry Primal* as part of the show's Clueless Gamer segment.[306] In 2019, he was a guest on the *Cold Ones* YouTube podcast.[307]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's popularity has allowed him to stir support for fundraising drives.[308] In February 2012, Kjellberg ran for King of the Web, an online contest. He lost the overall title, but still became the \"Gaming King of the Web\" for the 1–15 February 2012 voting period.[309] During the following voting period, Kjellberg won and donated his cash winnings to the World Wildlife Fund.[310] He has raised money for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,[19][310] and began a \"Water Campaign\" charity, where his fans could donate money to Charity: Water, in celebration of reaching ten million subscribers.[311] Kjellberg contributed one dollar to the charity for every 500 views the video announcing the campaign accumulated, up to a maximum of $10,000.[312] Kjellberg had the stated goal of raising US$250,000, but at the end of the drive, the amount raised was $446,612.[310][313][‡ 15] Kjellberg organized another charity drive for Charity: Water in February 2016.[314] The drive raised $152,239, surpassing a $100,000 goal.[315]\n\n\nIn celebration of reaching 25 million subscribers in June 2014, Kjellberg announced another charity drive for Save the Children. It raised over $630,000, surpassing a $250,000 goal.[316] In an interview with the Swedish magazine *Icon*, he has expressed a desire to continue these drives as time goes on, and also credited John and Hank Green as two individuals who gave him the idea of making unique videos for charity.[59] These videos are purchased by game manufacturers and advertisers, for prices ranging up to $50,000.[59]\n\n\nIn December 2016, he hosted *Cringemas*, a livestream held across two days (9 and 10 December, both at around 6 pm–10 pm GMT), with other Revelmode creators.[72] During the livestream, they helped raise money for RED, a charity committed to helping eliminate HIV/AIDS in Africa.[317] After the first day, the fundraiser raised over $200,000, after YouTube doubled their goal of $100,000, and at the end of the livestream, they had raised a total of over $1.3 million with help from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[318]\n\n\nOn 3 December 2018, Kjellberg announced that he had started a fundraiser on GoFundMe for Child Rights and You (CRY) to help Indian children, partially in response to racist comments left on his videos directed toward Indians.[319][320] Kjellberg also hosted a livestream on 4 December, donating all of its proceeds to CRY. He raised over $200,000.[319]\n\n\nOn 21 July 2019, Kjellberg started a fundraiser on GoFundMe with American actor Jack Black for National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), in the wake of the suicide of the internet personality Etika in June 2019. Kjellberg and Jack Black streamed themselves playing *Minecraft* together to raise money for their fundraiser. Kjellberg donated $10,000 to his fundraiser and managed to raise over $30,000 for NAMI.[321] Kjellberg has previously spoken on the topic of mental health, including his struggles with his own, and as part of the UK's Mental Health Awareness Week in 2017, he highlighted various resources to help one's mental health in a video.[322]\n\n\nIn celebration of receiving his 100 million subscribers Play Button in September 2019, Kjellberg announced in a video that he was donating $50,000 to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an international Jewish non-governmental organisation.[323] Part of Kjellberg's fanbase criticized his decision, citing controversial actions and stances of the ADL.[323] *Kotaku* and *Vice* praised Kjellberg's donation and were critical of the portion of Kjellberg's fanbase who opposed the donation.[324][325] Two days after his initial announcement, Kjellberg announced in another video that he had decided to withdraw his donation. He expressed that he was advised to donate to the ADL, and did not hand-pick an organization that he was passionate about, as he had done with previous donations.[326] Additionally, he confirmed that he would still make a $50,000 donation to an organization at some point in the future, but after undergoing his usual process to select a suitable one.[327][328]\n\n\nOn 31 October 2019, Kjellberg donated $69,420 to Team Trees, a fundraising drive taking action against deforestation by pledging to plant one tree for every dollar donated. The donation number is a comedic in-joke combining numbers from internet culture: 69 and 420.[329][‡ 16]\n\n\nIn early June 2020, Kjellberg raised more than $116,000 for the Sentencing Project, victims of police brutality, and for small businesses affected by Black Lives Matter demonstrators looting and rioting after the murder of George Floyd.[330][‡ 17]\n\n\nKjellberg pledged to donate money earned from his YouTube membership to various charities every month. By 2021, Kjellberg raised over $1 million to charities such as Red Nose Day, Movember, Papyrus, Blue Ocean Foundation, Save the Children Lebanon, and Winston's Wish.[154]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Marzia Kjellberg, Felix's wife, has featured in his videos on several occasions.\nKjellberg married his long-time Italian girlfriend Marzia Bisognin on 19 August 2019.[331] The couple have one son, born 11 July 2023.[332][333]\n\n\nKjellberg and Bisognin were introduced to each other through a friend of Bisognin's in 2011, and after establishing an online relationship, Kjellberg flew to Italy to meet her.[59] The pair shuffled between Sweden and Italy, before settling in Brighton, England.[8][59][334] Kjellberg explained that they moved to the UK in July 2013 for preference to live close to the sea and for better Internet connectivity.[59][‡ 18] He said he enjoyed the general anonymity that living in Brighton granted him.[16]\n\n\nA 2018 trip to Japan inspired Kjellberg to move to the country. Announcing their intention to permanently move there, Kjellberg and his wife bought a home in Japan in 2019.[335] The home was robbed in late 2019,[335] and the couple's move was delayed due to Japan restricting relocation regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[‡ 19] In May 2022, Kjellberg and his wife moved to their home in Japan with a 5-year business visa.[336]\n\n\nRegarding his political beliefs, Kjellberg stated in October 2019 that he is \"more apolitical than anything\", and that he was \"somewhere in between\" left-wing and right-wing.[66] In June 2014, Kjellberg stated that he is an agnostic atheist.[337]\n\n\nKjellberg has frequently mentioned in videos that he adheres to a pescetarian diet for various reasons.[‡ 20] To deal with stress stemming from his content creation workload, Kjellberg developed a daily whiskey-drinking habit.[47] During a *Cold Ones* podcast interview in July 2019, Kjellberg shared that a book on Buddhism inspired him to drop the habit.[338]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Film\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *South Park* | Himself\n | Comedy Central | Cameo;

Kjellberg's popularity on YouTube and extensive media coverage have made him one of the most noted online personalities and content creators. He has been portrayed in the media as a figurehead for YouTube, especially in the genre of gaming. \n\n\nBorn and raised in Gothenburg, Kjellberg registered his YouTube channel \"PewDiePie\" in 2010, primarily posting Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel gained a substantial following and was one of the fastest growing channels in 2012 and 2013, before becoming the most-subscribed on YouTube on 15 August 2013. From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, Kjellberg's channel was also the most-viewed on the platform. During this period, his content shifted focus from Let's Plays and diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos.\n\n\nKjellberg's content was already noted for its polarizing reception among general audiences online, but in the late 2010s, it became more controversial and attracted increased media scrutiny. In 2019, following a public competition with Indian record label T-Series, Kjellberg was overtaken as the most-subscribed YouTube channel. Kjellberg also became more reserved online, uploading less consistently and taking frequent breaks from Internet use. He eventually semi-retired from YouTube, choosing to upload less frequently for his enjoyment rather than as a career. Meanwhile, in his personal life, he moved to Japan with his wife, Italian Internet personality Marzia.\n\n\nWith over 111 million subscribers and 29 billion views,[c] his channel still ranks as one of the most-subscribed and viewed on YouTube. His popularity online has been noted to boost sales for the video games he plays, and has allowed him to stir support for charity fundraising drives. In 2016, *Time* magazine named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nFelix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg was born on 24 October 1989 in Gothenburg, where he was also raised.[8][9] He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna (née Hellstrand, born 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 1957), and grew up with his older sister, Fanny.[10] His mother, a former chief information officer (CIO), was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden.[10] His father is a corporate executive.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kjellberg studied at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg.\nDuring his childhood, Kjellberg was interested in art and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as play video games on his Super Nintendo Entertainment System, such as *Star Fox* and *Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest*.[12][13][14] During high school, he frequently played video games in his bedroom and would skip classes to join at an Internet café with friends.[12][13] During his last year of high school, he bought a computer with the money he made selling artwork through his grandmother's gallery.[12]\n\n\nKjellberg then went on to pursue a degree in industrial engineering and management at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, but left the university in 2011.[4][15] While it has been reported that he left Chalmers to focus on his YouTube career,[15] Kjellberg clarified in 2017 that he had left due to a lack of interest in his course of study. He further expressed that, in general, leaving university to pursue a YouTube career would be \"fucking stupid\".[‡ 3]\n\n\nKjellberg has also discussed an enjoyment of Adobe Photoshop, wanting to work on photo manipulation art using the program rather than be in school.[‡ 3] Following this passion after he departed from Chalmers, he entered Photoshop contests and almost earned an apprenticeship at a prominent Scandinavian advertising agency.[‡ 3] He was also interested in creating content on YouTube; after not earning the apprenticeship, he sold limited edition prints of his photoshopped images to purchase a computer to work on YouTube videos.[‡ 3]\n\n\n\n##  Internet career[edit]\n\n\n### 2010–2012: early years[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg originally registered a YouTube account under the name \"Pewdie\" in December 2006; he explained that \"pew\" represents the sound of lasers and \"die\" refers to dying.[12][16][17] After initially forgetting the password to this account, he registered the \"PewDiePie\" YouTube channel on 29 April 2010.[16] Following his exit from Chalmers, his parents refused to financially support him,[16] so he funded his early videos by working as a harbor captain, selling prints of his Photoshop art, and working at a hot dog stand.[‡ 3][18] Kjellberg stated that the ability to make videos was more important to him than a prestigious career.[18] Five years later, Kjellberg recalled, \"I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn't know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do.\"[18]\n\n\nIn his early years as a YouTube creator, Kjellberg focused on video game commentaries, most notably of horror and action video games.[19][20][21] Some of his earliest videos featured commentaries of mainstream video games including *Minecraft* and *Call of Duty*, although he was particularly noted for his Let's Plays of *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* and its related mods.[22][23] On these videos, Kjellberg has stated \"I was so shy back then,\" and added, \"It was so weird to me, sitting alone in a room talking into a microphone. That was unheard of back at the time. No one really did it.\"[13] Kjellberg's oldest video available for viewing is titled \"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\".[22] Uploaded on 2 October 2010, the video is noted for containing mainly Swedish commentary from Kjellberg, rather than the English language he would later employ in his videos.[22] The video has amassed over 21 million video views as of August 2022.[‡ 4]\n\n\nStarting on 2 September 2011, he also began posting weekly vlogs under the title of *Fridays with PewDiePie*.[13] The series was a weekly deviation from the Let's Play videos that formed most of his content output at the time, and often featured vlogs, and Kjellberg completing viewer requests.[13][24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fan art of Kjellberg from 2012, depicting him as a character from *Happy Wheels*\nBy December 2011, Kjellberg's channel had around 60,000 subscribers,[16] before rapidly increasing in 2012. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, Kjellberg spoke at Nonick Conference 2012.[25][26] July 2012 saw his channel reaching 1 million subscribers,[8] and it reached 2 million subscribers in September.[19] In October, OpenSlate ranked Kjellberg's channel as the No. 1 YouTube channel.[27] Kjellberg signed with Maker Studios in December, a multi-channel network (MCN) that drives the growth of the channels under it.[16] Prior to his partnership with Maker, he was signed to Machinima, which operates as a rival to Maker.[28] Kjellberg expressed feeling neglected by Machinima, and frustrated with their treatment; he hired a lawyer to free him from his contract with the network.[28]\n\n\nEarly in his YouTube career, Kjellberg used jokes about rape in his videos.[29] A satirical video, created by Let's Play YouTuber Michael \"Slowbeef\" Sawyer, mocking Kjellberg's content highlighted his usage of such jokes.[30] Shortly after, Kjellberg attracted criticism and controversy for the jokes, and in October 2012, he addressed the issue through a Tumblr post, writing, \"I just wanted to make clear that I'm no longer making rape jokes, as I mentioned before I'm not looking to hurt anyone and I apologise if it ever did.\"[‡ 5] *The Globe and Mail* stated \"*unlike* many young gamers, he listened when fans and critics alike pointed out their harmful nature, and resolved to stop making rape jokes.\"[29]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2014: becoming the most-subscribed user and continued growth[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 February 2013, Kjellberg's channel reached 5 million subscribers.[16] In April, he was covered in *The New York Times* after surpassing 6 million subscribers.[31] In May 2013, at the inaugural Starcount Social Stars Awards in Singapore, Kjellberg won the award for \"Swedish Social Star\".[32] Competing against Jenna Marbles, Smosh, and Toby Turner,[33] he won the award for \"Most Popular Social Show\".[34] In July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second most-subscribed YouTube user,[35] and reached 10 million subscribers on 9 July 2013.[16][36] In August, Kjellberg signed with Maker's gaming sub-network, Polaris.[37] Polaris functioned as a relaunching of The Game Station, Maker's gaming network.[38]\n\n\nKjellberg's subscriber count surpassed that of the leading channel, Smosh, on 15 August.[39] Kjellberg received a certificate from Guinness World Records for becoming the most subscribed YouTuber.[40] In November, YouTube's Spotlight channel overtook Kjellberg's as the most-subscribed.[41] Later in the month, Kjellberg proclaimed his dislike of YouTube's new comment system, and disabled the comment section on all of his videos.[42] On 23 December 2013, his channel overtook the YouTube Spotlight channel, to once again become the most-subscribed on YouTube.[43][44] Throughout 2012 and 2013, Kjellberg's channel was one of the fastest-growing on YouTube, in terms of subscribers gained.[45] *Billboard* reported that the channel gained more subscribers than any other channel in 2013.[46]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kjellberg's commentaries, originally best known for featuring horror video games, began to feature games that interested him regardless of genre. *Kotaku* wrote: \"Instead of limiting himself to horror games, Pewdiepie is now actively playing more things that interest him.\"[22]\n\n\n\n> \n> Around 2014, as YouTube began to invest more deeply in creators, the company developed a classification system for its stable of stars. Either they followed the *SNL* model, using YouTube to springboard into TV or film, or they took the Oprah path, building empires of fervent audiences right on YouTube.\n> \n> \n> PewDiePie was one of the best Oprahs. He lived and breathed YouTube.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n –Mark Bengen, *Like, Comment, Subscribe* (2022)[47]\n\nIn March 2014, he updated his video production output, announcing he would be scaling down the frequency of uploads.[48] In August 2014, Maker Studios released an official PewDiePie app for the iPhone, allowing audiences to view his videos, create custom favourite video feeds, and share videos with others.[49] Later in the month, Kjellberg uploaded a video, announcing he would permanently disable comments on his YouTube videos.[50] He cited most comments being spam and self-advertising and was not what he wanted to see.[51] After disabling comments, Kjellberg continued interacting with his audience through Twitter and Reddit.[52]\n\n\nOn 13 October, he decided to allow comments on his videos once more, albeit only after approval.[53] However, he expressed that he toggled his comment settings this way so that he could redirect viewers to instead comment on the forums of his Broarmy.net website.[54] He stated in a later video that disabling comments made him happier.[55] In the same year, Kjellberg began streaming videos of his co-hosted series, *BroKen*, onto MLG.tv.[56] He co-hosted the series with Kenneth Morrison, better known as CinnamonToastKen, who is also a video game commentator.[57]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Kjellberg hinted at the possibility that he would not renew his contract with Maker Studios upon its expiration in December 2014.[58] He had expressed his frustrations with the studio's parent company, Disney.[28] Kjellberg mulled the option of launching his own network.[59][60] However, in light of news outlets reporting his disinterest with Maker, he tweeted, \"I feel like I was misquoted in The *WSJ*, and I'm really happy with the work that Maker has been doing for me.\"[61] Kjellberg ultimately continued creating videos under Maker. His relationship with Maker saw the network launch an official PewDiePie website, app, and online store to sell merchandise, while Kjellberg promoted Maker's media interests, and gave the network a share of his YouTube ad revenue.[13]\n\n\nIn 2014 alone, Kjellberg's account amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers, and over 4.1 billion total views. Both figures were higher than any other user.[62][63] According to Social Blade, Kjellberg's channel became the most-viewed channel on the website on 29 December 2014, having amassed over 7 billion views by that date.[64][65]\n\n\n\n### 2015–2017: YouTube Red, Revelmode, and style change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kjellberg at PAX in 2015\n*The New York Times* retrospectively noted that around 2015, Kjellberg's video content experienced a change in style: \"He began to take more risks. He continued playing video games, but he started experimenting. He did viral challenges, made fun of other YouTubers, and reviewed meme submissions from his fans.\"[66] Kjellberg has attributed his content around this time as a result of immaturity, boredom with playing video games, YouTube's platform incentives, and the belief that his channel's growth had plateaued.[66] One video cited as being representative of this change featured Kjellberg reading erotic fan fiction about characters from the Disney film *Frozen*. Then-CEO of The Walt Disney Company Bob Iger was reportedly angered by the video, putting Kjellberg's deal with Maker Studios, a Disney subsidiary, in jeopardy.[66]\n\n\nOn 6 September 2015, his YouTube account became the first to surpass 10 billion video views.[11][67] Later in the month, Kjellberg teased about having a role in a web television series, stating that he was in Los Angeles for the show's shooting.[68] Although not many details were revealed at the time, it was later announced that the series would be an original YouTube Red series, titled *Scare PewDiePie*.[69] The series premiered the following February.[70]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Kjellberg announced a partnership with Maker Studios to produce Revelmode, a sub-network of Maker, that would showcase Kjellberg and his friends on YouTube in original series.[71] After the deal, the head of Maker Studios, Courtney Holt, stated, \"we're thrilled to be doubling down with Felix.\"[71] Along with Kjellberg, eight other YouTubers signed to the network upon its creation: CinnamonToastKen, Marzia, Dodger, Emma Blackery, Jacksepticeye, Jelly, Kwebbelkop, and Markiplier.[71] Three YouTubers – Cryaotic, KickThePJ, and Slogoman – would later join the sub-network after its launch.[72][73]\n\n\nThroughout 2016, Kjellberg's video style change became more apparent.[74] While producing fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour changed; he commented that he had shifted to drier humour, which was often not understood by younger viewers.[75] He examined his older videos, and while noting the stylistic changes he had undergone, he expressed specific regret for his casual use of words like *gay* or *retarded* in a derogatory sense.[76] In December 2016, *Kotaku*'s Patricia Hernandez wrote about his stylistic changes, explaining that \"over the last year, the PewDiePie channel has also had an underlying friction, as Kjellberg slowly distances himself from many of the things that made him famous. He's doing fewer Let's Plays of horror games like *Amnesia*,[75] and adding, \"the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, as he describes the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand.\"[75]\n\n\nOn 2 December 2016, he uploaded a video discussing his frustration with the issue of YouTube accounts experiencing an unexplained loss of subscribers and views.[‡ 6][77] Kjellberg stated that many people working with YouTube \"have no idea of the struggles that came with being a content creator.\"[75] A Google representative issued a statement to *Ars Technica*, stating that no decreases in subscriber numbers were out of the ordinary.[77] Kjellberg's video was uploaded as his channel approached 50 million subscribers, and he stated he would delete his channel once it reached the milestone.[78] On 8 December, his channel reached 50 million subscribers, becoming the first YouTube channel to do so.[79] He shortly thereafter received a custom Play Button from YouTube as a reward for reaching this milestone.[2] Ultimately, Kjellberg did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead deleted a smaller second channel he had then-recently created.[80] His threat to quit was also reported to be \"in fact, a promotional stunt\" for *Scare PewDiePie*.[47]\n\n\nKjellberg nevertheless continued to express discontent with the platform, aiming further criticism at YouTube's changing algorithm negatively affecting viewership for content creators.[80][81] The site's algorithm began to focus on watch time statistics and \"favor videos that drew daily viewers, higher engagement (more likes and comments) and cleaner 'ad-friendly' fare.\"[47] Kjellberg later recounted to *The New York Times* that the platform's boundaries were widely unknown to creators.[47] He responded to the algorithm changes by uploading vlogs that \"mixed earnest schmaltz [...] with inanity.\" Additionally, he \"enjoyed wading into the meme culture and edgelord humor that accompanied Donald Trump's ascent\".[47]\n\n\nDuring this late 2016 and early 2017 period Kjellberg uploaded a string of videos addressing what Kjellberg saw as negative effects to content creator viewership caused by the new algorithm.[80][82][83] As a satirical knock on the changing algorithms, Kjellberg made several videos asking viewers to help the video reach specific engagement milestones such as one million likes, dislikes, and comments.[82][84][85] The videos were successful, promptly achieving the goal Kjellberg requested from viewers;[82] the dislike video accumulated over 5 million dislikes before YouTube made such figures private in November 2021, becoming one of the most-disliked on the entire platform.[86]\n\n\n\n### 2017–2018: media controversies, streaming, and formatted shows[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I've made some jokes that people don't like. And you know what? If people don't like my jokes, I fully respect that. I fully understand that. I acknowledge that I took things too far, and that's something I definitely will keep in mind moving forward, but the reaction and the outrage have been nothing but insanity.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n –Felix Kjellberg, *My Response* video, February 2017 (relating to Fiverr controversy)[‡ 7]\n\nIn a video posted in January 2017, Kjellberg featured two paid individuals on Fiverr, asked to hold a sign that read \"Death to all Jews\". He alleged his intent was not against Jews, but to showcase how \"crazy\" the modern world and website were.[47][87][88] The video received negative attention and caused a media backlash, with various publications writing critically of Kjellberg's defense of his controversial content as jokes taken out of context, and opining that his content helps normalise ideologies such as fascism, neo-Nazism, and white supremacy.[89][90][91]\n\n\n*The Wall Street Journal* alleged that this was not the first time Kjellberg had used antisemitic language and imagery in his videos.[92][93] Kjellberg and the two individuals later apologised,[87] but the event led Maker Studios to cut their ties with Kjellberg and Google to drop him from the Google Preferred advertising program and cancel the upcoming second season of the *Scare PewDiePie* YouTube Red series.[94][95] Ultimately, Kjellberg apologised, but strongly rebuked media coverage of the event, with particular criticism aimed at *The Wall Street Journal* for how their reporting portrayed references to Nazis in some of his videos.[96] *The Wall Street Journal* response referred to another video with a YouTuber going by the name Jesus Christ, stating \"Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong,\" as well as Kjellberg's response to the Fiverr suspension of the Jesus Christ account.[96]\n\n\nAccording to Social Blade, his channel's total view count was surpassed by the Indian record label T-Series at the top of YouTube's view rankings on 14 February.[97][98]\n\n\nIn April, while still continuing to upload new content onto YouTube, Kjellberg created Netglow, a crowdsourced channel on the livestreaming service Twitch.[99] On Netglow, he started streaming *Best Club*, a weekly live stream show.[99] *Best Club* premiered on 9 April, with its first episode featuring Brad Smith alongside Kjellberg.[99] Kjellberg commented that his decision to create Netglow was in the works prior to the aforementioned allegations of antisemitic themes in his videos.[99] *Business Insider* detailed that Kjellberg's first stream amassed around 60,000 viewers, and that Netglow had accumulated 93,000 subscribers to that point.[100]\n\n\nIn September, while Kjellberg was live-streaming gameplay of *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds* to his YouTube channel, he used the ethnic slur \"nigger\" towards another player in the game.[87] The video clip of the incident quickly went viral despite Kjellberg deleting it, and garnered widespread criticism across the internet.[101] Kjellberg later apologised for the incident in a short video uploaded to his YouTube channel.[102] As a response to the incident, Campo Santo co-founder Sean Vanaman referred to Kjellberg as \"worse than a closeted racist\", announced that Campo Santo would file copyright strikes against Kjellberg's videos featuring the studio's game *Firewatch*, and encouraged other game developers to do the same.[103][104] Amidst the controversy stirred up by the incident, it was brought to light that Kjellberg was following several prominent far-right and white supremacist figures on Twitter, such as Stefan Molyneux, Carl Benjamin and Lauren Southern.[105] He later deactivated his Twitter account and unfollowed everyone he was previously following, stating \"What I don't like is the constant posturing that goes on there. People just can't seem to help themselves from pointing out what is good and what is bad, or how others are bad and you are good.\"[106]\n\n\nIn 2018, Paul MacInnes of *The Guardian* wrote about Kjellberg's YouTube content; he noted that each week Kjellberg posted videos featuring one of three series formats, comparing this uploading pattern to television programming.[107] The three series listed were *You Laugh You Lose*, which features Kjellberg watching humorous video clips while trying to not laugh; *Last Week I Asked You* (*LWIAY*), having begun as a parody and homage to Jack Douglass' *Yesterday I Asked You (YIAY)*, where he challenges his audience to create content and reviews the output; and *Meme Review*, in which he reviews popular Internet memes.[107] Kjellberg began a book club-styled series,[107] with his own enjoyment with the series also being noted.[107] Kjellberg began *Pew News*, a satirical series where he presents and discusses recent news stories while in-character, often as fictional characters named after CNN hosts, such as Gloria Borger, Poppy Harlow, or Mary Katharine Ham and sometimes, an amalgamation of these names.[108] *Pew News* parodies both mainstream news channels, such as CNN, and YouTube news channels, such as DramaAlert.[108] Topics covered by Kjellberg on *Pew News* included culture war topics he previously avoided.[66]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Kjellberg attracted controversy for using the term \"Twitch thots\" in a video that featured him watching a compilation of female Twitch streamers.[109][110] Alinity, a streamer featured in the video, responded by making a copyright claim against his video, which she stated was later removed by CollabDRM, a company that strikes videos on behalf of creators.[110] Alinity stated that her reaction was caused by \"the rampant sexism in online communities\", arguing that Kjellberg's comments degraded women; she refused to accept Kjellberg's apology.[109][111] In July, Kjellberg posted a meme with singer Demi Lovato's face; the meme jokingly referenced Lovato's struggles with addiction. The meme was posted around the same time Lovato was hospitalized after suffering an opioid overdose. As a result, he received criticism from online users.[112] Kjellberg later deleted the meme, and apologized for the incident.[112]\n\n\nIn a video uploaded in early December, Kjellberg promoted several small content creators on YouTube, recommending his viewers to subscribe to them. Among those creators was \"E;R\", whom Kjellberg highlighted for a video essay on Netflix's *Death Note*.[113] Shortly thereafter, *The Verge*'s Julia Alexander said that the video in question used imagery of the Charlottesville car attack, and that the channel made frequent use of racial and homophobic slurs.[113] In December 2018, *Vox* reported that \"E;R\" also contained white supremacist messaging. After online criticism, he described his posting as an \"oopsie\" and asserted that he had posted it \"recommending someone for their anime review\", rather than any intention to promote antisemitism.[114] Kjellberg said he was largely unaware of E;R's content apart from the *Death Note* video essay, revoked his recommendation of the channel, and edited his video to remove the reference.[113][114]\n\n\nOn 27 December 2018, Kjellberg uploaded \"YouTube Rewind 2018 but it's actually good\", in response to the generally negatively-received *YouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind*, which was originally uploaded by YouTube's Spotlight channel.[115]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: subscriber competition with T-Series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: PewDiePie vs T-Series\n\nIn September 2018, Kjellberg uploaded a *LWIAY* video discussing Indian record label T-Series' YouTube channel being projected to surpass his in subscribers.[116] On 5 October, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track against the label titled \"Tseries Diss Track\", stylized in all caps and later renamed \"Bitch Lasagna\"[117] in response to their YouTube channel being projected to surpass his in subscribers.[118] The video went on to replace \"A Funny Montage\" as Kjellberg's most-viewed video.[119] It included some lines mocking the Indian background of T-Series, which were described as racist in media publications.[120] On the prospect of being surpassed by T-Series in terms of subscriber count, he stated he was not concerned about T-Series, but feared the consequences a corporate channel surpassing him would have for YouTube as a video-sharing platform.[121] Online campaigns to \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" greatly assisted Kjellberg's subscriber growth; his channel gained 6.62 million subscribers in December 2018 alone, compared to the 7 million subscribers gained in all of 2017.[122]\n\n\nOn 12 March, Kjellberg uploaded an episode of his show *Pew News* in which he mentioned the 2019 Pulwama terrorist attack, where 40 Indian paramilitary troops were killed by a member of a Pakistan-based jihadist group. Following the attack, T-Series removed several songs by Pakistani artists on its YouTube channel after being pressurised by political party MNS to isolate Pakistani artists, a course of action that Kjellberg disagreed with.[123][124] The outlet Zee News reported that Kjellberg \"faced strong criticism for his comments on the heightened tension between Pakistan and India in [the] March 12 issue of *Pew News*\".[125] Kjellberg issued a clarification on Twitter, expressing that he was not attempting to speak on the broader India–Pakistan relations, but rather on the more specific context of T-Series removing artists' songs from its YouTube channel.[125]\n\n\nOn 15 March, the perpetrator of the live-streamed Christchurch mosque shootings said \"remember lads, subscribe to PewDiePie\" before carrying out the attacks. In response, Kjellberg tweeted his disgust after having his name associated with the attack, and offered condolences to those affected by the tragedy.[126] Various journalists covering the shooting reported that Kjellberg was not complicit with the shootings.[127] *The New York Times* suggested that Kjellberg's mention in the shootings was a ploy for the news media to attribute blame to Kjellberg, and to otherwise inflame political tensions.[128]\n\n\nAfter briefly gaining the title several times in early 2019, on 27 March, T-Series surpassed Kjellberg in subscribers to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube.[129] On 31 March, Kjellberg posted another diss track music video, titled \"Congratulations\", sarcastically congratulating T-Series for obtaining the title.[130][131][132] In the music video, Kjellberg mocked T-Series and its actions, alleging T-Series was founded to sell pirated songs and mocking them for sending him a cease and desist letter after \"Bitch Lasagna\".[130] Following the video's release, Kjellberg temporarily regained the most-subscribed position over T-Series.[133]\n\n\nOn 9 April, Kjellberg announced that he would live-stream exclusively on streaming service DLive, as part of a deal with the company.[134]\n\n\nOn 11 April, T-Series started to seek court orders to remove Kjellberg's \"diss tracks\" from YouTube.[135][136] The alleged court order was ruled in favor of T-Series. It was allegedly stated that the complaint against Kjellberg claimed that his songs were \"defamatory, disparaging, insulting, and offensive\", and noted that comments on the videos were \"abusive, vulgar, and also racist in nature.\"[137][138][139] Access to the music videos on YouTube was later blocked in India.[139] The two parties were reported to have come to a settlement later that July, although Kjellberg's videos remained blocked in India.[139]\n\n\nOn 28 April, Kjellberg uploaded a video entitled \"Ending the Subscribe to Pewdiepie Meme\" in which he asked his followers to refrain from using the phrase \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\", due to incidents such as the phrase being graffitied on a war memorial, and its mention by the Christchurch mosque shooter.[140][141] While live streaming the following day, Kjellberg showed a plane flying over New York City with a banner attached saying \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\", and called it \"a nice little wrap up\" to the meme.[142]\n\n\n\n### 2019: Nimses, *Minecraft* series, and milestones[edit]\n\n\nThe remainder of 2019 saw further controversies for PewDiePie. In early June, Kjellberg uploaded a video on YouTube sponsored by social media application Nimses.[143] The app spiked in popularity after he promoted it on his YouTube channel. Controversy ensued when Nimses' location features and privacy settings led fans of Kjellberg and fellow YouTubers to believe that he was promoting a privacy-invasive app, with some fans suspecting the app of being a pyramid scheme due to a referral program in the app that offered more in-application currency.[143] The Pirate Party Germany criticized his promotion of Nimses, warning that Kjellberg was promoting a potentially harmful app to a large audience.[143] Andrey Boborykin, the head of marketing and communications at Nimses, published a blog post denying the allegations that the app is privacy-invasive.[143] Kjellberg responded to the allegations in a video, dismissing them as \"rumors\", and claimed that Nimses was no more invasive than other social media apps.[143]\n\n\nDespite being surpassed by T-Series and the aforementioned controversy, Kjellberg continued to achieve high viewership on the site, mainly propelled by a return to consistent gaming uploads. On 21 June, Kjellberg launched *Gaming Week*, where he focused on uploading Let's Play videos every day, for the first time in several years. Among the games played was *Minecraft*, which he was openly surprised by how much he enjoyed playing it. Kjellberg largely centered his videos around *Minecraft* in the following months, with the content featured in his series *Meme Review* and *LWIAY* also becoming focused on the game. Although he had played *Minecraft* earlier in his YouTube career, he had very rarely played it in the following years due to his reluctance to join the trend of *Minecraft* YouTubers, who he felt only played the game because of its popularity rather than for their enjoyment.[144][145]\n\n\nThis transition was largely successful for Kjellberg, who received a large increase in views, achieving over 570 million views during the month of July, the most views received by the channel in a month since at least October 2016. His daily number of new subscribers grew from 25,000 to 45,000 during that month.[144] Despite this success, Kjellberg insisted that he played the game for his enjoyment, and did not want to become solely a \"*Minecraft* YouTuber\", stating, \"If *Minecraft* gets boring, I can just move on to other things.\"[145]\n\n\nOn 25 August, Kjellberg became the first individual YouTuber to surpass 100 million subscribers. His channel was the second overall to reach the milestone, after T-Series, who passed the mark earlier in the year.[146] YouTube tweeted a congratulatory post to note the occurrence,[147] and awarded him a Red Diamond Play Button.[3] In December, Kjellberg was acknowledged as the most-viewed creator of the year, with more than 4 billion views in 2019.[148]\n\n\n\n### 2019–2020: China ban, brief breaks, and content deals[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Kjellberg stated in a video that his YouTube content, as well as content related to him on other websites such as Reddit, had been blocked in China.[149] He explained that this was due to his comments about the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, and an image of Chinese president Xi Jinping being compared to Winnie the Pooh shown in a previous video.[149]\n\n\nIn November, *Business Insider* reported Kjellberg as a client of Re6l, a Toronto-based influencer media and ecommerce company.[150] In December, Kjellberg announced that he would take a break from YouTube the following year, and deleted his Twitter account because of his dissatisfaction with the site.[151][152]\n\n\nKjellberg's hiatus ultimately proved to be brief, lasting a little over a month during early 2020.[153] Taking short breaks from creating online content proved to become a behavior he would repeat throughout the following years.[154][155][156]\n\n\nIn his first video uploaded following his 2020 hiatus, Kjellberg made jokes about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spoke in mock-Chinese phrases. After receiving criticism for these jokes, Kjellberg uploaded another video in which he made more jokes about COVID-19, and defended the jokes he made in his previous video.[157]\n\n\nKjellberg signed an exclusive deal to stream on YouTube in May, as the platform was enrolling high-profile streamers to rival competitors like Twitch and Mixer.[158] At the time of signing with YouTube, Kjellberg had amassed over 800,000 followers on DLive, but due to his deal with the former, and not having streamed on the latter in four months, *Tubefilter* noted that it was unclear if Kjellberg was still affiliated with DLive.[159] Kjellberg's DLive channel was eventually deactivated.[160]\n\n\nIn October, Kjellberg's fans began to suspect his channel was shadowbanned, after noticing it and his recent uploads failed to appear in YouTube's search results.[161] YouTube responded to the shadowban allegations on Twitter, claiming that the reason for the problems was due to search results being influenced by YouTube's system somehow flagging his recent uploads, and that due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube was taking longer to review videos, including Kjellberg's.[161] YouTube apologized for the situation and stated they were \"working on fixing the issue.\"[161]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: soft retirement and move to Japan[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"YouTube actually has become fun again for the past two years. And that's when I realized, why should I quit? It's my dream after all to do YouTube. I've worked so hard for this.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n –Felix Kjellberg, September 2022 (relating to his soft retirement from YouTube)[162]\n\nIn November, Kjellberg uploaded a Q&A video, reflecting on his YouTube career. During the video, he expressed that he views himself as \"retired\" from YouTube, having felt so internally since earlier in the year.[‡ 8][162] He continued to upload videos fairly frequently on the platform afterwards, albeit, inconsistently.[162] He also \"committed to posting more unstructured content, like vlogs.\"[163]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Kjellberg signed a distribution deal with Jellysmack, a content creation company.[164] The deal entails Jellysmack optimizing and then distributing Kjellberg's content for a Facebook Watch audience.[164] Although now having his content released onto the Facebook platform, Kjellberg continued to debut his content on YouTube.[164]\n\n\nOn 14 February, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track titled \"Coco\" about Cocomelon, a kids-oriented channel which had been rising in subscribers for several years, and was growing by nearly two million subscribers per month.[165] Kjellberg clarified that the children appearing in the music video were provided with a clean version of the lyrics to mime to while they were being filmed, and that their parents allowed them to participate in the video.[166] The video was later taken down by YouTube who claimed that it violated their policies on harassment and child safety.[166] Kjellberg stated he \"[didn't] actually care about Cocomelon\" and did not want the pretend-rivalry with the channel to \"get out of control\", as his rivalry with T-Series had previously.[166]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Kjellberg and his wife Marzia moved from England to Japan. Much of his content following the move centered around \"vlogs about daily life around Tokyo.\"[167] In September, Kjellberg explained the shift his upload philosophy underwent when he announced his \"retirement\" from the platform: he opted to share videos for fun, as he did when he first began uploading videos.[162]\n\n\nOn 14 November, MrBeast surpassed Kjellberg as the most-subscribed individual creator on YouTube.[168][169] The two have been noted as contemporaries and friends, with MrBeast having previously supported the 'Subscribe to PewDiePie' campaign during Kjellberg's competition with T-Series.[163] Previously, Kjellberg answered a viewer question relating to whether MrBeast would surpass his subscriber count, replying \"He definitely will ... He definitely deserves it, I hope he does it.\"[163][170]\n\n\nAfter years of inactivity, Kjellberg's Twitch account began streaming episodes of the Canadian sitcom *Trailer Park Boys* in March 2023. This was part of a test by the distribution and monetization service CoPilot Media, as they were on the verge of rolling out \"PewDiePie Infinity\", \"essentially an endless loop of [Kjellberg]'s videos.\"[171] On 9 May, Kjellberg's Twitch account received a ban despite only streaming this previously aired content.[171] On 29 June, Kjellberg announced he would be taking an indefinite hiatus from YouTube due to his imminent fatherhood.[172]\n\n\n\n## YouTube content[edit]\n\n\nSee also: PewDiePie videography\n\n### Style[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his career, Kjellberg's content mainly consisted of Let's Play videos.[173] His commentaries of horror games made up his best-known content during this early stage, although he eventually expanded into other genres.[22] Unlike conventional walkthroughs, Kjellberg devoted his Let's Play videos to communicating more personally with his audience.[174] *Variety* detailed that Kjellberg \"acts like he's spending time with a friend. He begins each video introducing himself in a high-pitched, goofy voice, drawing out the vowels of his YouTube moniker, then delves into the videos.\"[173]\n\n\nKnown for his idiosyncratic sense of humor, the nature of his video content has been described by various outlets as goofy, energetic, and obnoxious,[29][175][176][177] yet genuine and unfiltered.[70][175] Lev Grossman of *Time* noted that \"he's totally unpolished, but at the same time his timing is consistently spot-on,\" adding that \"most of the critical literature about PewDiePie focuses on the bad language and crude physical humor–and admittedly there are a lot of both–and the fact that he is, at the end of the day, just a guy playing video games and yelling.\"[177] Rob Walker of Yahoo! wrote Kjellberg's \"chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments, and pretty much nonstop profanity.\"[175] Occasionally, Kjellberg resorts to just gameplay, resulting in silent or emotional commentary;[175] his playthrough of *The Last of Us*, was detailed to leave the usually vocal gamer speechless at its ending.[178]\n\n\nWith his channel's growth, Kjellberg's content has become more diverse; in addition to traditional Let's Play videos, he has uploaded content including vlogs, comedy shorts, and formatted shows.[13] Toward the end of the 2010s, he began uploading much reaction-style content, such as his late 2018 and early 2019 videos reacting to various compilations of TikTok videos.[179][180] Kjellberg has also uploaded music onto his channel, often accompanied by animation, fan art, or live footage. Oftentimes, music videos uploaded onto his channel are collaborative in nature, as has worked with artists such as The Gregory Brothers (also known as Schmoyoho), Boyinaband, Roomie, and Party In Backyard.[181][182][183]\n\n\n\n### Production and output[edit]\n\n\nDuring the early portion of his YouTube career, Kjellberg did not hire any editor or outside assistance to help with his video output, stating he wanted \"YouTube to be YouTube.\"[48] While his early videos would simply feature raw footage, he later began to dedicate time to edit his videos.[74] Swedish magazine *Icon* noted his use of the Adobe Premiere Pro editing software.[59] On separate occasions, he later sought an editor and a production assistant to help with his content creation.[184][185] Although now having an editor for his videos, in a 2017 video, he maintained that \"I'm just a guy. It's literally just me. There's not a producer out there [...] there's no writer, there's no camera guy.\"[‡ 7] In July of that same year, Kjellberg commented that a couple of months prior, he had an office and a limited number of employees assisting him with his content creation.[‡ 9]\n\n\nKjellberg has been noted by both himself and media outlets as prolific on the platform, having uploaded videos with a high frequency.[48] By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 of which have been made private.[‡ 10] As a result, Kjellberg has made videos and statements expressing his feelings of burnout from frequently creating content for the platform and its effect on his mental health.[186][187] In March 2017, Kjellberg commented that his channel was running on a daily output, stating, \"[there's] a lot of challenges in doing daily content, [...] but I still really, really love the daily challenge—the daily grind—of just being like, 'hey, I'm gonna make a video today, no matter what.' And sometimes it really works, and sometimes it doesn't.\"[‡ 11]\n\n\n\n### Subscribers and viewership[edit]\n\n\n> \n> An interesting note about Kjellberg's rise to fame: he never really had a video go viral. He just ground it out, slow and steady, growing subscriber by subscriber.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n –Lev Grossman, *Time* (2016)[177]\n\nMedia writers have noted that Kjellberg's content has been largely built up \"methodically,\"[176] as opposed to him having risen to fame through a viral video.[177][176] At the same time, the growth of Kjellberg's channel has been described as rapid by various sources; Douglas Holt of the *Harvard Business Review* commented that \"the power of crowdculture propelled [Kjellberg] to global fame and influence in record time.\"[188] Many close to Kjellberg have described him as \"steadfastly loyal to his YouTube audience,\" with one calling him \"a little spectrumy\" in this regard.[47]\n\n\nBy December 2011, Kjellberg's channel had around 60,000 subscribers,[16] and on 9 May 2012, it reached 500,000 subscribers.[189] In March 2012, Swedish newspaper *Expressen* reported that Kjellberg had uploaded at least one video per day for the seven months preceding their report. Additionally, the publication noted that Kjellberg's channel accumulated 71 million total video views to that point and 25 million video views in February 2012 alone.[190] The channel reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012,[8] and 2 million subscribers in September.[19]\n\n\nThroughout 2012 and 2013, Kjellberg's channel was one of the fastest-growing on YouTube, in terms of subscribers gained.[45] In 2013, the channel grew from 3.5 million to just under 19 million subscribers,[191] and by the end of 2013, it was gaining a new subscriber every 1.037 seconds.[192] *Billboard* reported that the channel gained more subscribers than any other channel in 2013.[46] In June 2013, *Tubefilter* began a monthly listing of the most viewed YouTube channels. In 2013, Kjellberg was consistently toward the top of this listing, ranking #1 in June, July, August, October, and December of that year.[193] Analyzing *Tubefilter*'s data, *The Guardian* reported that Kjellberg's channel earned 1.3 billion video views in the second half of 2013.[194] The channel had two of the ten most-viewed gaming videos in 2013: the sixth-part of his *Mad Father* Let's Play was the third-most viewed of the year, earning 27 million views, and an entry in his *Funny Gaming Montage* series ranked as the eight-most viewed gaming video of 2013.[195]\n\n\nOn 18 February 2013, Kjellberg's channel reached 5 million subscribers,[16] and in April, he was covered in *The New York Times* after surpassing 6 million subscribers.[31] Many of Kjellberg's most-viewed videos are highlight compilations of his Let's Play videos.[182][196] One of these compilations, \"A Funny Montage\", was uploaded in June 2013, and spent a considerable amount of time as Kjellberg's most-viewed, with publications citing it as such through 2018.[197][198]\n\n\nIn July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second-most-subscribed YouTube user,[35] and reached 10 million subscribers on 9 July.[16][36] Kjellberg's subscriber count surpassed that of the leading channel, Smosh, on 15 August 2013.[39] On 31 October 2013, his channel became the first to reach 15 million subscribers.[199] Shortly after, PewDiePie was surpassed by YouTube's Spotlight channel in subscribers.[41] After jostling for the top position during the next month, PewDiePie's channel took firm hold of the most-subscribed title on 23 December.[200] On 9 January 2014, the channel reached the 20 million subscriber milestone.[201]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kjellberg's channel was the most-viewed in January, and then for seven consecutive months from March to September.[202] In August 2014, *Tubefilter* reported that the channel surpassed the Rihanna VEVO channel on 19 July as the most-viewed on YouTube at around 5.2 billion video views.[203] Data from Social Blade, however, shows that the channel still had less video views than the emimusic channel.[204] According to their data, the channel surpassed emimusic on 29 December 2014, at over 7.2 billion views, to become the most-viewed channel on the website.[205][206] According to *Tubefilter* and *The Guardian*, the channel amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers and around 4.1 billion video views in 2014; both figures were higher than any other user.[62][63] The latter figure was a reported 81% increase from the channel's video views in 2013; the channel was the most viewed in that year, as well.[62]\n\n\nDuring July 2015, his videos were documented to receive over 300 million views per month.[207] It eclipsed the 10 billion video view milestone on 6 September 2015, becoming the first channel to do so.[11][67][208] At that time, \"A Funny Montage\" (then-titled \"Funny Montage #1\") was Kjellberg's most-viewed video, with approximately 68.8 million views; a partial reason it accumulated many views was due to its status as the PewDiePie channel trailer.[67] In 2016, the channel experienced decreased viewership, which was similarly experienced by other content creators across the platform, due to changes in YouTube's algorithm.[83] On 8 December, it reached 50 million subscribers, becoming the first YouTube channel to do so.[79]\n\n\nOnline campaigns to \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" greatly assisted Kjellberg's subscriber growth; his channel gained 6.62 million subscribers in December 2018 alone, compared to the 7 million subscribers gained in all of 2017.[122] Renewed interest in Kjellberg's videos due to his subscriber competition with T-Series resulted in his channel earning over 500 million video views in December 2018, which was then the channel's single-highest monthly view count.[209] After briefly gaining the title several times in early 2019, on 27 March, T-Series surpassed Kjellberg in subscribers to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube.[129] The day after \"Congratulations\" was uploaded, Kjellberg temporarily regained his lead over T-Series as the most subscribed channel.[133]\n\n\nIn July 2019, in large part due to Kjellberg's *Minecraft* gameplay videos, his channel surged in video views. *The Verge* noted that it was Kjellberg's most successful month in years, in terms of viewership.[141] Data from Social Blade[d] shows the channel received 573 million video views, a then-single-month record amount of views for Kjellberg's channel.[210] Kjellberg was the most-viewed creator of 2019, with his channel receiving over 4 billion views during the year.[148]\n\n\nAlong with T-Series, the PewDiePie channel is one of only two on YouTube to receive all five tiers of YouTube Creator Awards: Silver, Gold, Diamond, Custom, and Red Diamond Creator. These awards are earned upon surpassing the 100,000; 1 million; 10 million; 50 million; and 100 million subscriber milestones, respectively.[211] Kjellberg nicknamed his Custom Creator Award the Ruby Play Button, which he received in 2016.[2] In 2019, Kjellberg's channel became the second overall, and the first run by an individual creator, to receive the Red Diamond Creator Award.[212]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's YouTube content has been met with mixed critical reception. Media outlets write that he is one of the most popular creators online, despite being involved in multiple media controversies.[213][214][215] His content has been described by various outlets as goofy, energetic, and filled with profanity,[29][175][177][176] and his on-camera personality has been generally received as genuine, unfiltered, and self-aware by various outlets.[70][175] Kjellberg's content has also been received negatively by the media, with detractors describing it as \"obnoxious\" and often reporting his popularity as an \"inexplicable phenomenon\".[22][176] Rob Walker of *Yahoo!* has commented positively on Kjellberg's intelligence, stating Kjellberg is \"clearly\" smart based on when he speaks directly to his audience.[175] Other outlets, such as *Time* and *The Verge*, have written similar sentiments, describing Kjellberg as \"articulate\" and \"self conscious\", respectively.[70][177] In contrast, Andrew Wallenstein of *Variety* heavily criticised Kjellberg, following his channel becoming the most-subscribed on YouTube, describing his videos as \"aggressive stupidity\" and \"psychobabble.\"[176]\n\n\nLev Grossman of *Time* noted that \"he's totally unpolished, but at the same time his timing is consistently spot-on,\" adding that \"most of the critical literature about PewDiePie focuses on the bad language and crude physical humor–and admittedly there are a lot of both–and the fact that he is, at the end of the day, just a guy playing video games and yelling.\"[177] Walker wrote Kjellberg's \"chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments, and pretty much nonstop profanity.\"[175] Justin Charity of *The Ringer* stated, \"PewDiePie isn't a comedian in any conventional sense,\" but described his \"hosting style [as] loopy and irreverent in the extreme: He's a little bit stand-up, a little bit shock jock, a little bit 4chan bottom-feeder.\"[216]\n\n\nIn regards to his early Let's Play content, Swedish columnist Lars Lindstrom commented positively, stating that \"Felix Kjellberg [having] a comic talent is indisputable. It is both amazingly awful and amazingly funny when a father bikes around with his son in the game *Happy Wheels* and both get crushed and bloody again and again and PewDiePie improvises absurd comments as the game continues. The secret is that he loves to play these games and that he has fun doing it.\"[15] As his content went through changes in style in 2016, Patricia Hernandez of *Kotaku* wrote, \"the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, as he describes the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand.\"[75]\n\n\nFollowing the controversy regarding alleged antisemitic content in his videos, many media publications both in and outside of the gaming and tech industries severely criticised Kjellberg's content. These outlets suggested that Kjellberg's content contained and promoted fascist, white supremacist, and alt-right ideologies.[89][90][217] A *Wired* article covering the controversy referred to him as a \"poster boy for white supremacists\".[217] Charity opined that Kjellberg's \"occasional, reactionary irreverence has become a core component of his appeal. Likewise, for critics and fans who value inclusivity — and among outside observers who view [Kjellberg]'s conduct as inexplicably frequent in the news — [Kjellberg] represents all that is wrong and alienating about games culture.\"[216]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, \"Congratulations\" and \"Bitch Lasagna\" were banned in India when the Delhi High Court granted an injunction in favor of T-Series.[136][137] The complaint against Kjellberg allegedly stated that his songs were \"defamatory, disparaging, insulting, and offensive,\" and noted that comments on the videos were \"abusive, vulgar, and also racist in nature.\"[137][139][218] Although both parties came to a settlement later in the year, Kjellberg's videos remain blocked in India.[139]\n\n\nOn 16 October 2019, Kjellberg uploaded an episode of his *Meme Review* series, in which he reacted to memes about the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests.[219] The video also featured his commentary on the China–NBA issue and the Blitzchung controversy, as well as memes comparing Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping to Winnie-the-Pooh.[219][220] As a result, Kjellberg's channel and content were reportedly censored in China.[219][220] The BBC wrote that instead of a complete ban, only \"some content related to the YouTuber has indeed been made inaccessible online,\" and that \"there is no evidence to suggest this was done on the orders of the government.\"[221] The BBC suggested that Baidu seemingly removed PewDiePie-related messages on a forum out of caution, but that \"a [Baidu] search for his name still returns more than eight million results.\"[221] *Vox* wrote that \"access to reposted PewDiePie videos and music\" appeared to be available to some regional users.[219]\n\n\nAccording to *Business Insider*, \"For years, critics of Pewds have been campaigning for YouTube to bar him from the platform to no avail.\"[157]\n\n\n\n## Public image and influence[edit]\n\n\nSince breaking through on YouTube with his Let's Play-styled videos, Kjellberg has emerged as one of the most noted, influential, and controversial online personalities. He has also been cited by various publications as largely influential for digital content creation and Internet culture, particularly relating to video gaming subcultures. *Eurogamer* noted that Kjellberg was cast by media reports as a \"figurehead\" of YouTubers, and for being nearly synonymous with gaming YouTubers in general.[213] In 2016, Douglas Holt of *Harvard Business Review* wrote of Kjellberg as \"YouTube's greatest success\", and regarded him, about gaming subcultures, \"the star of this digital art world—just as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Patti Smith had done in urban art worlds back in the analog days\".[188] Lev Grossman of *Time* wrote that Kjellberg dominated \"an entire medium single-handed,\" and pioneered \"a new form of fame not controlled or manufactured by a studio or a network.\"[177]\n\n\nKjellberg has stated that he dislikes being called \"famous\".[222] In a 2014 interview with *The Wall Street Journal*, he called the influence he has \"kind of scary\".[47] In a *Rolling Stone* article, Kjellberg admitted to being shocked by his fame; he recalled a gaming event near his hometown, stating \"I remember there were five security guards yelling at a crowd to back up – it was out of control. It was shocking to find myself in that situation, where I was that celebrity person.\"[13] In a 2019 interview with the *New York Times*, Kjellberg commented on his influence stating, \"it's weird for me to be in this position because I don't really want to be in this position.\"[66] He went on to express feelings of nostalgia for his early YouTube career, when he had fewer subscribers, and admitted to periodically thinking about giving up the platform altogether.[66] Colleagues and media have referred to Kjellberg as \"normally press shy\", \"quiet\", and \"much more reserved in real life.\"[47][222] After moving to Japan, Kjellberg expressed enjoying a lack of recognition while in public.[167][‡ 12]\n\n\n\n### As a YouTube personality[edit]\n\n\n#### After becoming the most-subscribed[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Rob Walker of *Yahoo!* called Kjellberg's popularity \"insane\", writing that it \"strikes me as considerably more curious – I mean, you know who Rihanna is, but would you recognize this kid if he was standing in line behind you at the bank?\"[175] Walker, among other reporters, has questioned and analysed reasons for his popularity.[175][176][177] Walker commented on Kjellberg's interaction with his audience, writing, \"While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly more than willing to make fun of himself in the process.\"[175]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ross Miller of *The Verge* wrote, \"Love it or hate it, his success – like so many other YouTube personalities – isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record.\"[223] Writing about and analyzing Kjellberg's career, Kevin Roose of *The New York Times* wrote that during the period in which Kjellberg had the most-subscribed channel but prior to his alleged antisemitism controversy, \"[Kjellberg] was not just the YouTuber with the biggest channel. To many Inner YouTubers, he represented the values of the platform — lo-fi, authentic, defiantly weird.\"[66]\n\n\n\n#### Following media controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn the wake of the *Wall Street Journal* controversy, John Herman of *The New York Times* commented that \"[Kjellberg] bemoaned [YouTube's] structure and the way it had changed; he balked at its limits and took joy in causing offense and flouting rules. Over time, he grew into an unlikely, disorienting, and insistently unserious political identity: He became YouTube's very own populist reactionary.\"[224] YouTube's chief business officer Robert Kyncl stated Kjellberg \"underestimated the responsibility he had as the platform's most popular ambassador, even if he himself is not a hateful person.\"[47]\n\n\nIn 2018, Paul MacInnes of *The Guardian* wrote, \"Given the scale of his audience and his influence, not much is written about PewDiePie. Tech sites like *The Verge* and *Polygon* report on him and often critique him severely. But in the mainstream media, his name has broken through only either as a result of novelty or scandal,\" and noted that his content was rarely written about.[225] Touching on Kjellberg's alleged antisemitic controversy, MacInnes also added that he \"is funny, intelligent, innovative and highly charismatic [...] to call him an alt-right agitator would perhaps be unfair as he has never publicly identified with the proto-fascist movement. But he shares much of their culture and amplifies it across the world. People should pay PewDiePie more attention.\"[225]\n\n\nMax Read of *Intelligencer* retrospectively opined on Kjellberg's alleged antisemitic controversy, commenting that \"Kjellberg, for his part, is seen as a standard-bearer for the oppressed YouTuber subject to the whims of YouTube's corporate masters — a symbol of the ongoing tension between YouTube and the culture that it spawned,\" and added that \"he, through fights over his behavior and his position within the YouTube space, is something like a gateway drug to bigger political battles over free speech, the role of media, and diversity.\"[226]\n\n\nShortly prior to his 2020 hiatus, Erin Nyren of *Variety* commented that Kjellberg's \"popularity continues unabated in spite of—or perhaps because of—the fact that he has been the subject of ongoing controversies.\"[214]\n\n\n\n### Media lists and rankings[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's influence has ranked highly on various lists. Subtitled as the \"King of YouTube\" on *The Verge*'s 2014 \"Verge 50\" list—the outlet's \"definitive list of the most interesting people building the future.\" On his listing's blurb, *The Verge* wrote that \"Kjellberg's real talent is finding the human within games. He's just a normal person, finding the authentic in games for an audience that are desperate for a little more humanity.\"[227] In 2015, Kjellberg was included on *Time*'s list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, with the publication writing that his channel \"broadcasts some of the most-watched programs in pop culture.\"[228] Later in 2015, Kjellberg was featured on the cover of *Variety*'s \"Famechangers\" issue, with the magazine ranking him as the \"#1 Famechanger\", or \"those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest\".[229]\n\n\nThe following year, *Time* included him on their *Time 100* list, with *South Park* co-creator Trey Parker writing in his entry, \"I know it might seem weird, especially to those of us from an older generation, that people would spend so much time watching someone else play video games [...] But I choose to see it as the birth of a new art form. And I don't think anyone should underestimate its most powerful artist.\"[230] *Forbes* wrote that \"[Kjellberg's] overall brand suffered earlier this year [2017] when he included antisemitic content in nine of his videos,\" when citing their reason for not ranking him as the top gaming influence.[231] *Forbes* still included Kjellberg in the gaming category of their June 2017 \"Top Influencers\" list.[232] In September 2019, *The Sunday Times* ranked him first on their list of the UK's 100 most influential people online.[233][234]\n\n\n\n### Channel demographics[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's channel appeals strongly to younger viewers, a group Google refers to as \"Generation C\" for their habits of \"creation, curation, connection and community\".[17][174] This demographic has been more commonly referred to as Generation Z by researchers and popular media. In a 2017 video, Kjellberg shared a screenshot of data provided by YouTube regarding his channel statistics, which suggested his largest demographic was among the 18–24 age group, followed by the 25–34 age group.[225] Surveys conducted throughout the 2010s highlighted that favorable opinions of Kjellberg, as well as his name recognition and online influence within these age ranges, was comparable to that of mainstream figures such as Jennifer Lawrence, Justin Bieber, and LeBron James.[235][236]\n\n\n*The New York Times* published results of an online reader poll the publication held, showing that only 17% of their digital readers correctly identified Kjellberg after seeing an image of him; the outlet wrote that the poll's results \"probably reflect the fact that *Times* readers are older than a representative sample of Americans, citing that \"in 2015, the median digital *Times* subscriber was 54 years old.\"[237] In 2016, Maker Studios' international chief content officer was cited in *The Guardian* as comparing \"the average parent's bafflement at their teenage children's passion for stars like PewDiePie, KSI, and Zoella to past generations' inability to comprehend punk rock or gangsta rap.\"[238]\n\n\nStudies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of video game players engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to being an important reason for Kjellberg's popularity.[239]\n\n\n\n### Fan base[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fans demonstrate in Tallinn during the PewDiePie vs T-Series subscriber competition.\n*ESPN* noted in 2015 that Kjellberg typically performed a \"Brofist\" gesture at the end of his videos,[16] and often referred to his fan base as the \"Bro Army\", addressing his audience as \"bros\".[240] Likewise, media outlets also adopted the name when referring to Kjellberg's fan base.[16][241][242] Later in his YouTube career, Kjellberg stopped using the term \"Bro Army\", and began to refer to his audience as \"Squad Fam\", \"9 year olds\", and later \"19 year olds\", in his videos.[243] The fan base has been subject to criticism; in July 2018, *Wired* published an article, referring to Kjellberg's fan base as \"toxic\", stating that \"it's not just that they've stuck with the Swedish gamer/alleged comedian as he peppered his videos with racial slurs, rape jokes, antisemitism, and homophobia for nearly a decade (though that's bad enough). It's also that they insist that PewDiePie somehow isn't being hateful at all.\"[242]\n\n\nAt the 2013 Social Star Awards in Singapore, Kjellberg greeted his fans personally despite security warning him against doing so.[17][244] Kjellberg also mentioned this event to *Rolling Stone*, stating, \"I didn't even understand they were screaming for me at first.\"[13] Kjellberg has commented on fans from Malaysia and Singapore; during a trip to Kuala Lumpur in 2016, fans entered his hotel to search for him, which he expressed annoyance with.[245] In a 2019 vlog, Kjellberg expressed that fans in Malaysia and Singapore can be \"very hectic and scream-ish and crazy, and they lose their minds when they see you.\"[245] He later apologized to fans from the two countries, stating that seeing the effect he had \"on fans back then [during his 2013 trip to Singapore] was cool\" and that he would \"be lying\" if he claimed to hate this initial experience with fans, although added that he has grown to not enjoy being treated as more than a person.[245] *Business Insider Singapore* reported that some fans took offense to Kjellberg's comments, but that \"most netizens accepted the YouTuber's apology and admitted that fans had gone overboard in invading his privacy.\"[245]\n\n\nRelating to his responsibility to his audience, Kjellberg has stated, \"many people see me as a friend they can chill with for 15 minutes a day,\" adding, \"The loneliness in front of the computer screens brings us together. But I never set out to be a role model; I just want to invite them to come over to my place.\"[59] Correlating with this note, his audience has been reported to provide positive remarks about him; some of his viewers created and contributed to a thread expressing that he has made them happier and feel better about themselves.[22] Conversely, during an informal Twitter poll conducted by one *Kotaku* reporter, respondents described him as \"annoying\" and an \"obnoxious waste of time.\"[22] Additionally, *Rolling Stone* has documented the existence of several Reddit threads dedicated to sharing disparaging views of Kjellberg.[13]\n\n\n\n### Influence on video games[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg has been noted to support video games from indie developers, often having played through such titles in his videos.[19][246] His commentaries have had a positive effect on sales of indie games, with *The Washington Post* writing that \"gamemakers have observed a kind of Oprah effect.\"[11][239][247] The developers of the indie game *McPixel* stated, \"The largest force driving attention to *McPixel* at that time were 'Let's Play' videos. Mostly by Jesse Cox and PewDiePie.\"[248] Kjellberg has also been confirmed to have driven the popularity of *Yandere Simulator* during that game's development,[249][250] and positively influenced the sales of *Slender: The Eight Pages* and *Goat Simulator*.[22][59] Although games being featured on Kjellberg's channel have reportedly contributed to their commercial success, he has stated, \"I just want to play the games, not influence sales.\"[251]\n\n\nIn 2019, Kjellberg's *Minecraft* videos led a surge of interest towards the game, which saw an increase in players. It also registered the largest-trending score on YouTube since January 2017 and surpassed *Fortnite* as the most-searched game on YouTube, with the searches for *Minecraft* on Google almost doubling since previous months.[144][145] Video game media outlets, such as *Polygon* and *The Verge*, largely credited this newfound success to Kjellberg, with *The Verge* suggesting that the surge \"proves that the 'PewDiePie Effect' is still real\" (about the Oprah effect-like success enjoyed by games Kjellberg has played).[144] Several other popular YouTubers followed suit by focusing on *Minecraft* content.[144] *Polygon* also noted that in the wake of Kjellberg's focus on *Minecraft*, YouTubers focused on *Fortnite* began to shift towards making *Minecraft* videos instead.[145]\n\n\nKjellberg, along with characters from *Amnesia: The Dark Descent*, were referred to by a *McPixel* level designed in his honour.[252] Additionally, in the video game *Surgeon Simulator 2013*, the Alien Surgery stage features an organ called \"Pewdsball\" in honour of Kjellberg.[253][254] Kjellberg agreed to allow the developers of *Surgeon Simulator 2013* to use his likeness in *GOTY IDST*, a showering simulation video game.[255][256] Kjellberg was also included as an NPC in the indie game *Party Hard*,[257] and had a voice acting role in *Pinstripe*, a puzzle adventure game.[258]\n\n\n\n### Income[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2014, Kjellberg made an estimated $140,000–$1.4 million from YouTube revenue, according to Social Blade.[259] In June 2014, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Kjellberg earned $4 million in 2013;[260][261] Kjellberg confirmed on Reddit that the figures were somewhat close to what he actually earned.[59] In July 2015, the Swedish newspaper *Expressen* reported that Kjellberg's production company, PewDie Productions AB, reported earnings of 63.7 million SEK ($7.5 million) in 2014.[262][263] In 2015, outlets described Kjellberg's income as sizeable, and even \"remarkable\";[264] Kjellberg appeared at the top of *Forbes*' October 2015 list of the richest YouTube stars with a reported $12 million earned in 2015.[265]\n\n\nIn December 2016, *Forbes* named Kjellberg as the highest-earning YouTuber with his annual income reaching $15 million.[266] This was up 20% from 2015, largely due to his YouTube Red series *Scare PewDiePie* and his book *This Book Loves You*, which sold over 112,000 copies according to Nielsen Bookscan.[267] Kjellberg relies on external revenue sources rather than YouTube's ad model, which he has stated is common for most YouTube content creators; Kjellberg commented that YouTube's ad revenue model is inefficient, unstable, and insecure.[268] According to *Forbes*, Kjellberg's income dropped to $12 million in 2017, which made him the sixth highest-paid YouTuber during that year.[269] *Forbes* commented that Kjellberg's income would have been higher had he avoided the pushback from advertisers resulting from the controversies surrounding his videos in 2017.[270]\n\n\nExtensive media coverage on his earnings has been met with frustration by Kjellberg, who has stated that he is \"tired of talking about how much [he makes]\",[271] and suggested that media outlets should rather report on the money he raised for charity.[272] *The Guardian* commented that the reason the media was so captivated by Kjellberg's earnings is that the topic \"offers a rare insight into the money being made at the top end of YouTube stardom,\" adding \"it's very rare for any YouTube creator to talk about their earnings publicly, not least because YouTube itself does not encourage it.\"[18]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Video games, authorship and fashion design[edit]\n\n\nOn 24 September 2015, Kjellberg released his own video game, *PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist*, on iOS and Android. The game was developed by Canadian game developer Outerminds in collaboration with Kjellberg.[273][274] On 29 September 2016, he released another game developed by Outerminds, *PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator*.[275] It was released as a free app on iOS and Android devices and reached the number one spot on the App Store within a few days of its release.[241][275] On 31 October 2017, former *Goat Simulator* developer and lead designer Armin Ibrisagic announced his partnership with Kjellberg for his video game *Animal Super Squad*.[276] Kjellberg helped Ibrisagic with the core concept of the game and provided him with feedback and creative direction.[276] In 2019, Kjellberg released two more video games: *PewDiePie's Pixelings* on 15 November and *Poopdie* on 12 December.[277][278] The latter game was rejected from the App Store due to its \"crude imagery and sound effects which may disgust users\", but is available on Android.[278]\n\n\nPenguin Group's Razorbill imprint released Kjellberg's *This Book Loves You*, a parody of self-help books, on 20 October 2015.[69] The book is a collection of anti-proverbs paired with visuals.[279] It was number-one on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for two weeks in the Young Adult Paperback category.[280][281] Kjellberg and his wife Marzia launched Tsuki, a unisex clothing brand which they announced in a YouTube video.[282]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in April 2014 and spanning into August, Kjellberg, along with his then-girlfriend Marzia, began a marketing campaign for the Legendary Pictures film *As Above, So Below*.[283][284] Kjellberg's videos for the marketing campaign included a miniseries featuring him participating in the \"Catacombs Challenge\". The challenge involved Kjellberg searching for three keys in the catacombs to open a container holding \"the Philosopher's stone\".[285] The couple's videos were able to earn nearly 20 million views.[286] Maker Studios, which both Kjellberg and Marzia were represented by, brokered the ad deal between the two and Legendary Pictures.[285] In January 2015, Mountain Dew partnered with Kjellberg to launch a fan fiction contest, in which winning fan fiction will be animated into video formats and then uploaded onto his channel.[287]\n\n\nWhile he entered partnerships early in his YouTube career, Kjellberg maintained that he worked with few brands and conducted few promotions.[59][288] He stated he felt he made enough money from YouTube and found endorsing too many brands to be disrespectful to his fans.[289] On this topic, Kjellberg has expressed disappointment when a sizable portion of people misinterpret his intentions; he stated, \"if I mention on Twitter that I find this or that Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it.\"[59] Eventually, Kjellberg began to work with more brands, stating that he wanted to have a genuine relationship with brands and added he was lucky to not be dependent on working with them to support his career.[‡ 13] In January 2019, Kjellberg announced a partnership with energy drink company G Fuel.[‡ 14]\n\n\n\n### Appearances in other media[edit]\n\n\nAside from his own YouTube channel, Kjellberg has made appearances in the videos of other YouTube creators. In April 2013, he made a cameo in an episode of *Epic Rap Battles of History*, portraying Mikhail Baryshnikov.[290] In July 2013, he starred alongside Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox of Smosh, as well as Jenna Marbles, as guest judges on the second season of *Internet Icon*.[291] Kjellberg also appeared in YouTube's annual year-end *Rewind* series each year from 2013 to 2016;[292][293][294][295] he once again appeared in *YouTube Rewind* in 2019.[296]\n\n\nOn 3 June 2014, Sveriges Radio announced that Kjellberg was chosen to host his own episode of the Swedish radio show *Sommar i P1*.[297] Due to his international popularity, the episode was recorded in both Swedish and English. The Swedish version was broadcast on 9 August 2014 on Sveriges Radio P1, and when the broadcast started the English version was published online.[298][299] The link to the Swedish version of the broadcast was shared over 3,500 times, and the link to the English version was shared about 49,000 times.[300]\n\n\nIn December 2014, Kjellberg guest-starred in two episodes of the 18th season of *South Park.* The two episodes served as a two-part season finale. The first part, titled \"#REHASH\" aired on 3 December, while the second part, titled \"#HappyHolograms\", aired on 10 December.[301][302] In the episodes, he parodied himself and other Let's Play commentators, providing commentary over *Call of Duty* gameplay in an overly expressive way.[301]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Kjellberg was announced as a voice actor in the Vimeo fantasy series, *Oscar's Hotel for Fantastical Creatures*.[303] In October of the same year, he appeared as a guest on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,*[304] where Colbert referred to him as \"Emperor of the Internet\".[305] In February 2016, he appeared on *Conan*, playing *Far Cry Primal* as part of the show's Clueless Gamer segment.[306] In 2019, he was a guest on the *Cold Ones* YouTube podcast.[307]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's popularity has allowed him to stir support for fundraising drives.[308] In February 2012, Kjellberg ran for King of the Web, an online contest. He lost the overall title, but still became the \"Gaming King of the Web\" for the 1–15 February 2012 voting period.[309] During the following voting period, Kjellberg won and donated his cash winnings to the World Wildlife Fund.[310] He has raised money for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,[19][310] and began a \"Water Campaign\" charity, where his fans could donate money to Charity: Water, in celebration of reaching ten million subscribers.[311] Kjellberg contributed one dollar to the charity for every 500 views the video announcing the campaign accumulated, up to a maximum of $10,000.[312] Kjellberg had the stated goal of raising US$250,000, but at the end of the drive, the amount raised was $446,612.[310][313][‡ 15] Kjellberg organized another charity drive for Charity: Water in February 2016.[314] The drive raised $152,239, surpassing a $100,000 goal.[315]\n\n\nIn celebration of reaching 25 million subscribers in June 2014, Kjellberg announced another charity drive for Save the Children. It raised over $630,000, surpassing a $250,000 goal.[316] In an interview with the Swedish magazine *Icon*, he has expressed a desire to continue these drives as time goes on, and also credited John and Hank Green as two individuals who gave him the idea of making unique videos for charity.[59] These videos are purchased by game manufacturers and advertisers, for prices ranging up to $50,000.[59]\n\n\nIn December 2016, he hosted *Cringemas*, a livestream held across two days (9 and 10 December, both at around 6 pm–10 pm GMT), with other Revelmode creators.[72] During the livestream, they helped raise money for RED, a charity committed to helping eliminate HIV/AIDS in Africa.[317] After the first day, the fundraiser raised over $200,000, after YouTube doubled their goal of $100,000, and at the end of the livestream, they had raised a total of over $1.3 million with help from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[318]\n\n\nOn 3 December 2018, Kjellberg announced that he had started a fundraiser on GoFundMe for Child Rights and You (CRY) to help Indian children, partially in response to racist comments left on his videos directed toward Indians.[319][320] Kjellberg also hosted a livestream on 4 December, donating all of its proceeds to CRY. He raised over $200,000.[319]\n\n\nOn 21 July 2019, Kjellberg started a fundraiser on GoFundMe with American actor Jack Black for National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), in the wake of the suicide of the internet personality Etika in June 2019. Kjellberg and Jack Black streamed themselves playing *Minecraft* together to raise money for their fundraiser. Kjellberg donated $10,000 to his fundraiser and managed to raise over $30,000 for NAMI.[321] Kjellberg has previously spoken on the topic of mental health, including his struggles with his own, and as part of the UK's Mental Health Awareness Week in 2017, he highlighted various resources to help one's mental health in a video.[322]\n\n\nIn celebration of receiving his 100 million subscribers Play Button in September 2019, Kjellberg announced in a video that he was donating $50,000 to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an international Jewish non-governmental organisation.[323] Part of Kjellberg's fanbase criticized his decision, citing controversial actions and stances of the ADL.[323] *Kotaku* and *Vice* praised Kjellberg's donation and were critical of the portion of Kjellberg's fanbase who opposed the donation.[324][325] Two days after his initial announcement, Kjellberg announced in another video that he had decided to withdraw his donation. He expressed that he was advised to donate to the ADL, and did not hand-pick an organization that he was passionate about, as he had done with previous donations.[326] Additionally, he confirmed that he would still make a $50,000 donation to an organization at some point in the future, but after undergoing his usual process to select a suitable one.[327][328]\n\n\nOn 31 October 2019, Kjellberg donated $69,420 to Team Trees, a fundraising drive taking action against deforestation by pledging to plant one tree for every dollar donated. The donation number is a comedic in-joke combining numbers from internet culture: 69 and 420.[329][‡ 16]\n\n\nIn early June 2020, Kjellberg raised more than $116,000 for the Sentencing Project, victims of police brutality, and for small businesses affected by Black Lives Matter demonstrators looting and rioting after the murder of George Floyd.[330][‡ 17]\n\n\nKjellberg pledged to donate money earned from his YouTube membership to various charities every month. By 2021, Kjellberg raised over $1 million to charities such as Red Nose Day, Movember, Papyrus, Blue Ocean Foundation, Save the Children Lebanon, and Winston's Wish.[154]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Marzia Kjellberg, Felix's wife, has featured in his videos on several occasions.\nKjellberg married his long-time Italian girlfriend Marzia Bisognin on 19 August 2019.[331] The couple have one son, born 11 July 2023.[332][333]\n\n\nKjellberg and Bisognin were introduced to each other through a friend of Bisognin's in 2011, and after establishing an online relationship, Kjellberg flew to Italy to meet her.[59] The pair shuffled between Sweden and Italy, before settling in Brighton, England.[8][59][334] Kjellberg explained that they moved to the UK in July 2013 for preference to live close to the sea and for better Internet connectivity.[59][‡ 18] He said he enjoyed the general anonymity that living in Brighton granted him.[16]\n\n\nA 2018 trip to Japan inspired Kjellberg to move to the country. Announcing their intention to permanently move there, Kjellberg and his wife bought a home in Japan in 2019.[335] The home was robbed in late 2019,[335] and the couple's move was delayed due to Japan restricting relocation regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[‡ 19] In May 2022, Kjellberg and his wife moved to their home in Japan with a 5-year business visa.[336]\n\n\nRegarding his political beliefs, Kjellberg stated in October 2019 that he is \"more apolitical than anything\", and that he was \"somewhere in between\" left-wing and right-wing.[66] In June 2014, Kjellberg stated that he is an agnostic atheist.[337]\n\n\nKjellberg has frequently mentioned in videos that he adheres to a pescetarian diet for various reasons.[‡ 20] To deal with stress stemming from his content creation workload, Kjellberg developed a daily whiskey-drinking habit.[47] During a *Cold Ones* podcast interview in July 2019, Kjellberg shared that a book on Buddhism inspired him to drop the habit.[338]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Film\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *South Park* | Himself\n | Comedy Central | Cameo;

He began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012, at the age of 13,[17] under the handle MrBeast6000. His early content ranged from Let's Plays to \"videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers\".[18] He went viral in 2017 after his \"counting to 100,000\" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views.[18] His videos, typically involving challenges and giveaways, became increasingly grand and extravagant.[19] Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired some of his childhood friends to co-run the brand. As of 2023, the MrBeast team is made up of over 250 people, including Donaldson himself.[20] Other than MrBeast, Donaldson runs the YouTube channels Beast Reacts, MrBeast Gaming, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts)[21] and the philanthropy channel Beast Philanthropy.[22][23] He formerly ran MrBeast 3 (initially MrBeast 2), which is now inactive.[24][25] As of 2023, he is the highest paid YouTuber,[26] and has an estimated net worth of $500 million.[27]\n\n\nDonaldson is the founder of MrBeast Burger and Feastables; and a co-creator of Team Trees, a fundraiser for the Arbor Day Foundation that has raised over $23 million;[28][29] and Team Seas, a fundraiser for Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup that has raised over $30 million.[30] Donaldson won the Creator of the Year award four times at the Streamy Awards in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023; he also won the Favorite Male Creator award twice at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, *Time* named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJames Stephen Donaldson[b] was born on May 7, 1998[31] in Wichita, Kansas.[32] He was mainly raised in Greenville, North Carolina with his brother CJ.[33][34] He moved often and was under the care of au pairs due to his parents working long hours and serving in the military. His parents divorced in 2007.[33] In 2016, Donaldson graduated from Greenville Christian Academy, a small private evangelical Christian high school in the area. He briefly attended East Carolina University before dropping out.[35][36]\n\n\n\n## YouTube career[edit]\n\n\n### Early viral attempts (2012–2017)[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson uploaded his first YouTube video in February 2012, at the age of 13, under the name of \"MrBeast6000\".[37] His early content ranged from Let's Plays, mainly focused on *Minecraft* and *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*,[37] videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,[38] videos that offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators and commentary on YouTube drama. Donaldson appeared infrequently in these videos.[37]\n\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Donaldson began to gain popularity with his \"Worst intros on YouTube\" series poking fun at YouTube video introductions.[37][39][40] By mid-2016, Donaldson had around 30,000 subscribers. In fall 2016, Donaldson dropped out of East Carolina University to pursue a full-time career as a YouTuber.[18][38] His mother did not approve of this and made him move out of the family home.[35]\n\n\nAs his channel grew, Donaldson hired four childhood friends – Kris Tyson (formerly Chris Tyson), Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds and Jake Franklin – to contribute to his channel.[35] They then contacted numerous YouTubers in order to obtain statistics of their successful videos and predict the platform's recommendation system.[41][*clarification needed*] Franklin left the crew in 2020. Afterwards, Karl Jacobs, previously a cameraman, was promoted to take his place.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n### Rise to fame (2017–2020)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast in 2018\nIn January 2017, Donaldson published an almost day-long video of himself counting to 100,000, which became his breakthrough viral video.[19] The ordeal took him 40 hours, with some parts sped up to \"keep it under 24 hours.\"[45] Donaldson gained popularity during this period with stunts, such as attempting to break glass using a hundred megaphones, watching paint dry for an hour,[36] attempting to stay underwater for 24 hours, which ended up failing due to health issues, and an unsuccessful attempt to spin a fidget spinner for a day.[46] By 2018, Donaldson had given out $1 million through his outlandish stunts, which earned him the title of \"YouTube's biggest philanthropist\".[35]\n\n\nDuring the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in 2018, a competition to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube, Donaldson bought billboards and numerous television and radio advertisements to help PewDiePie gain more subscribers than T-Series.[47][48] During Super Bowl LIII, he bought multiple seats for himself and his team, whose shirts spelled out \"Sub 2 PewDiePie.\"[49][50]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Donaldson organized and filmed a real-life battle royale competition in Los Angeles with a prize of $200,000 (two games were played, making game earnings of $100,000 for each game) in collaboration with *Apex Legends*.[51] The event and prize pool was sponsored by *Apex Legends* publisher Electronic Arts.[52]\n\n\nDonaldson was accused of using counterfeit money in his video titled \"I Opened A FREE BANK\", published on November 23, 2019.[35] He later explained that he used fake money to avoid participant safety concerns and that participants received real checks after the shoot.[35]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Donaldson created a rock, paper, scissors competition stream that featured 32 influencers and a grand prize of $250,000, which at the time became YouTube's most-watched live Original event with 662,000 concurrent viewers.[53] The event was won by Nadeshot.[54] In October 2020, Donaldson hosted another influencer tournament, this time trivia, featuring 24 competitors with a grand prize of $300,000. The tournament was won by siblings Charli and Dixie D'Amelio, which caused controversy due to claims that they cheated.[55]\n\n\n\n### Mainstream success (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jimmy Donaldson in 2021\nOn January 1, 2021, Donaldson released the video \"Youtube Rewind 2020, Thank God It's Over\".[56] In Donaldson's video, he explains that he had always believed that YouTubers \"should get more say in Rewind\", and with this in mind, he decided to call \"hundreds of YouTubers\".[56] At the end of the video, Donaldson gives a shout-out to PewDiePie, citing him and his 2018 Rewind as the inspiration for Donaldson's Rewind.[56] A month later, Donaldson signed a Facebook and Snapchat content distribution deal with Jellysmack.[57][58]\n\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards 2023\nIn November 2021, Donaldson uploaded \"$456,000 *Squid Game* in Real Life!\", a recreation of the survival drama streaming television series *Squid Game* in real life. The video had 456 people compete for a $456,000 cash prize.[59] The video was one of the most-watched YouTube videos of 2021, receiving over 130 million views within a week.[60] A review of the video in *Vice* argued that it \"badly misunderstood the anti-capitalist message of *Squid Game*\".[61] Despite this, *Squid Game* creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has reacted positively to recreations and parodies of the series.[62]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Donaldson created a third influencer tournament featuring 15 competitors with a grand prize of $1,000,000.[63][64][65] In January 2022, *Forbes* ranked Donaldson as YouTube's highest-earning creator, earning an estimated $54 million in 2021. *Forbes* stated that his income in 2021 would have placed him 40th in the 2020 Forbes Celebrity 100, earning as much money as Vin Diesel and Lewis Hamilton did in 2020.[66][67]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2022, Donaldson surpassed 100 million subscribers on his main channel, making him the fifth channel and the second individual YouTuber to achieve the milestone.[68][69] On November 17, 2022, Donaldson achieved the Guinness World Record of \"Most Subscribers for an Individual Male on YouTube\" with his MrBeast channel at 112,193,139 subscribers.[70] The previous record holder, PewDiePie, had held the record as the most subscribed YouTuber for almost ten years.[71] Donaldson achieved one billion video views over a period of 30 days on his main YouTube channel in November 2022.[72] On October 15th, 2023, Donaldson surpassed 200 million subscribers.[73]\n\n\n\n## YouTube content[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his career, Donaldson's content usually consisted of Let's Plays, \"best and worst\" videos and YouTube commentary.[74][37] Donaldson's present-day videos are categorized into three genres: stunt videos, where Donaldson or other participants perform challenges that are interesting, challenging, or dangerous; \"junklord\" videos, where Donaldson uses a large quantity of a particular product in an unusual way or spends an extravagant amount on it; and giveaway videos, where Donaldson gives away large amounts of money or extravagant prizes to people, usually including a competitive aspect.[c] Giveaway videos are considered to be a distinctive feature of Donaldson's content.[74]\n\n\nDonaldson's videos leverage YouTube's recommendation algorithm in order to go viral, mainly by maximizing click-through rate and viewer retention.[74] To maximize click-through rate, he focuses on creating effective topics, titles and thumbnails.[75] In an interview with Lex Fridman, he stated that for him to create a viral video, it needed to be \"original, creative, something people really need to see, ideally never been done before\".[76] His titles are designed to attract attention by promising outrageous stunts, and using certain keywords like \"24-hours\" and \"challenge\".[41][75] His thumbnails are designed to be easily understandable, clearly focused and brightly colored.[77] To maximize viewer retention, Donaldson paces the videos to have viewers engaged throughout. His videos typically span 10-20 minutes. He hooks viewers by explaining the premise in under half a minute at the start of the video,[41] and promises a \"finale\" to have viewers engaged until the end of the video.[74]\n\n\nDonaldson's funding for these videos mainly come from sponsorships and Google's AdSense program.[78] Donaldson was reported in 2022 to spend about $1 million on each video.[79] Although Donaldson's videos rarely turn a profit, he is concentrated more on expanding his YouTube channel rather than earning a profit, stating in an interview with *Rolling Stone*: \"I could be doing cheaper videos, [...] But I just don't want to. I want to push the boundaries to go bigger, bigger\".[79][80] Most of his funding come from sponsorships.[78] Donaldson uses his reaction channel and gaming channel to help finance his main channel, as their videos are relatively cheap to produce and make a substantial amount of money.[79] *The Verge* noted that his revenue is self-perpetuating: \"The more viral he becomes, the more brands want to work with him, and the bigger his own AdSense earnings get. He can then entice viewers with even bigger giveaway videos. It's a never ending cycle.\"[78] Donaldson earns passive income through merchandise, MrBeast Burger, and Feastables.[74][81]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Donaldson employs over 250 people.[82] They include writers, editors and production assistants. Many employees were people familiar to Donaldson, such as friends and family members.[83] Some former employees alleged that Donaldson nurtured a difficult work environment. In a May 2021 *New York Times* article, Matt Turner, an editor for Donaldson from February 2018 to September 2019, claimed that Donaldson berated him almost daily, including calling him a \"retard\". Turner reported that he was regularly not credited for his work.[83] Reporting by *Insider* showed that Turner previously posted a video in 2018 explaining his allegations, and in October 2019 released a deleted Twitter thread which stated that he was \"yelled at, bullied, called mentally retarded and replaceable by Donaldson every single day.\"[84] Nate Anderson, another editor, quit after working for Donaldson for a week in 2018 over what he said were unreasonable demands, and called Donaldson a perfectionist. After releasing a video describing his experience, Anderson reportedly received death threats from Donaldson's fans. Nine other employees who worked for Donaldson also stated that while he was sometimes generous, his demeanor would change when the cameras were off.[83][84] Donaldson disputes these claims, stating: \"We have high standards, but it’s not a toxic work environment.\"[79] Donaldson also claims that he gave Turner $10,000 and suggested a job at another company to him at the end of his contract.\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Finger on the App[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Donaldson, in collaboration with Brooklyn-based art collective MSCHF, released a one-time multiplayer mobile game titled *Finger on the App*. In the game, players touch their phone screen and the last person to remove their finger from the screen wins $25,000.[85] In the end, four people ended up winning $20,000 each after keeping their finger on the app for over 70 hours.[86] The game was reportedly so successful that a sequel titled *Finger on the App 2* was planned to originally launch in December 2020. The game was postponed to February, and then further delayed to March 2021 due to a flood of downloads, causing the game to crash and requiring the game's developers to upgrade their servers. This time, the game featured a grand prize of $100,000.[87] The winner kept their finger on the phone screen for around 51 hours. The second-place finisher also received a prize of $20,000.[88]\n\n\n\n### MrBeast Burger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MrBeast Burger\n\n![](image)A MrBeast Burger restaurant in New Jersey\nWill Hyde, a producer for the MrBeast channel, announced in a November 2020 article with *The Wake Weekly* that Donaldson would launch a virtual restaurant called MrBeast Burger in December 2020. Hyde said his team worked with Virtual Dining Concepts during the development of the restaurant concept. He said that MrBeast Burger will sell franchise rights to serve the burgers to restaurants across the U.S. and customers will be able to order the burgers via online delivery services.[89]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Donaldson announced that he would bring a MrBeast Burger shop to the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey, near New York City, to be the location of his first U.S. restaurant. The restaurant opened on September 4, 2022.[90]\n\n\nOn June 17, 2023, Donaldson expressed wishes to shut down MrBeast Burger due to fears that quality cannot be guaranteed, saying he regrets signing \"a bad deal\" with Virtual Dining Concepts, LLC, but said the company \"won't let me stop even though it's terrible for my brand.\"[91][92][93] On July 31, 2023, Donaldson sued Virtual Dining Concepts to end their partnership, alleging that the company damaged his reputation by prioritizing the expansion of the MrBeast Burger brand over food quality. Donaldson also claimed he received no payment from the partnership.[94][95] Virtual Dining Concepts disputed the claims, stating Donaldson had grown his reputation due to the MrBeast Burger brand, and accused Donaldson of attempting a new deal for personal gain and resorting to \"bullying\" when rejected.[96]\n\n\n\n### Feastables[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Feastables\n\n![](image)Feastables Bar\nIn January 2022, Donaldson announced the creation of a new food company called Feastables, which launched with its own brand of chocolate bars called \"MrBeast Bars\". At launch they offered three flavors of bars: original, almond and quinoa crunch. The launch corresponded with a sweepstakes with over $1 million in prizes, including ten grand prize winners who would receive a chance to compete for a chocolate factory in a future video, emulating *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*.[97] The video, released in June 2022, contained a series of elimination challenges where the winner won the choice of the chocolate factory or a $500,000 cash prize. Michelin Star chef Gordon Ramsay featured as a judge in the final challenge of the video and ultimately decided who won the cash prize.[98][99] Feastables reportedly made $10 million in its first few months of operation.[100]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2023, Donaldson asked fans on Twitter to \"clean up the presentation\" of Feastables displays on store shelves, and suggested that they obscure competing products. Feastables offered fans entry into a $5,000 raffle if they provided proof of their assistance. The tweets drew criticism and accusations that Feastables was exploiting fans for unpaid labor.[101][102]\n\n\nOn October 2, 2023, Feastables signed a partnership with the Charlotte Hornets to include MrBeast's insignia on their jerseys.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Investments and partnerships[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson is an investor in the tech startup Backbone, which produces the Backbone One, a controller that makes smartphones appear more similar to Nintendo Switch controllers, and the Backbone app, a content creation and social tools app for its users.[105][106]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Donaldson partnered with Creative Juice financial network to introduce Juice Funds, a $2 million investment fund for content creators.[107][83]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Donaldson became a long-term investor and partner of financial technology company Current.[108][109] The same month, Donaldson received backlash after fans lost large amounts of money in a cryptocurrency scheme that Donaldson had invested in and promoted.[83]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Donaldson partnered with East Carolina University to create a course centered around YouTube content creation.[110][111]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Donaldson featured as a judge on Gordon Ramsay's *Food Stars* show.[112]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n### Team Trees[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Team Trees\n\n![](image)Team Trees\nOn October 25, 2019, Donaldson and former NASA engineer and YouTuber Mark Rober announced a collaborative fundraising challenge event on YouTube called #TeamTrees. The goal of this project was to raise $20 million for the Arbor Day Foundation by January 1, 2020, and plant trees \"no later than December 2022.\" Every donation goes to the Arbor Day Foundation, which pledges to plant one tree for every dollar donated. Notable YouTubers such as Rhett & Link, Marshmello, iJustine, Marques Brownlee, The Slow Mo Guys, Ninja, Simone Giertz, Jacksepticeye and Smarter Every Day brought attention to the project, and trees began to be planted in October 2019 in US national parks.[113][114]\n\n\nOn December 19 of that year, the $20,000,000 goal was surpassed.[115] The project has received large donations from corporate executives Jack Dorsey, Susan Wojcicki, Elon Musk[116] and Tobias Lütke,[117] as well as from companies such as Discovery, Verizon and Plants vs. Zombies.[118] Tobias Lütke, founder and CEO of Shopify, holds the record for the highest donation at 1,000,001 trees planted.[119] As of February 11, 2023, the original goal of 20 million trees has been far surpassed, with over 24.3 million trees in the ground.[120]\n\n\n\n### Beast Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greenville received Thanksgiving meals as part of an initiative by Beast Philanthropy and Jennie-O.[121][122]\nOn September 17, 2020, the YouTube channel Beast Philanthropy was created.[123] On the channel's first video, Donaldson announced the charity and food bank and named Darren Margolias, who had appeared in previous videos, as executive director.[24][124] According to the channel description, 100% of its advertising revenue, brand deals and merchandise sales are donated to charity.[19][123]\n\n\nNotable initiatives by Beast Philanthropy include giving away 10,000 turkeys to his hometown Greenville,[121][122] donating 20,000 shoes to children in Africa,[125] and gifting $300,000 worth of technology to various schools.[126]\n\n\n\n### Team Seas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Team Seas\n\n![](image)Team Seas\nOn October 29, 2021, Donaldson and Rober organized another collaborative challenge event on YouTube titled #TeamSeas. The goal of this project was to raise $30 million for the Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup by January 1, 2022. The $30 million goal would fund the removal of 30 million pounds of plastic and other waste from oceans, rivers, and beaches. Donaldson and Rober enlisted thousands of content creators, including AzzyLand, DanTDM, TommyInnit, LinusTechTips, TierZoo, LEMMiNO, The Infographics Show, Hannah Stocking, Dhar Mann and Marques Brownlee, and partnered with BEN and TubeBuddy's initiative of eight million global creators, to promote the fundraiser.[127][128][129]\n\n\n\n### Cataract surgery[edit]\n\n\nIn a video published in January 2023 titled \"1,000 Blind People See For The First Time\", Donaldson paid for cataract surgery for a thousand people who had severely limited vision and had been unable to afford the procedure.[130] Responses to his video on the subject ranged from praise at its intention to spread awareness to criticism that he was creating \"charity porn\" motivated solely by profit.[131] Other comments criticized the American medical system for failing to provide the necessary healthcare to the patients in the video, questioning why patients had to rely on a YouTuber for the procedure.[132]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson describes himself as an introvert. Donaldson admits to having difficulty maintaining a social life due to his obsession with YouTube and his intense work ethic. Donaldson's mother, Sue, attributes his withdrawn lifestyle to their frequent relocations and his struggles with Crohn's disease.[133]\n\n\nDonaldson dated Maddy Spidell, a YouTuber, from 2019 to 2022. He has dated Thea Booysen, a gaming streamer, since 2022.[134][135]\n\n\nIn June 2023, Donaldson stated that he was invited to go on a tourist expedition to view the wreck of the *Titanic* in the OceanGate submersible *Titan* but declined the offer.[136] The submersible imploded in the Atlantic Ocean, killing all five aboard.[137]\n\n\n\n### Personal views[edit]\n\n\nIn an April 2022 interview with *The Daily Beast*, Donaldson announced that he was no longer an evangelical Christian and identified himself as an agnostic. He also stated that he had long disagreed with the church's position on homosexuality. He states that during the time he grew up in \"the heart of the Bible Belt\", he had religion \"beat into [his] head every day\", and was taught that \"gay people are the reason God's going to come and burn this Earth\". Although he considered anti-LGBT rhetoric to be normal growing up, he has disavowed it since then, stating: \"I realized, 'Oh, this isn't normal. This is just a weird place I grew up in.' So, that type of thing, I [wish I could] go back in time and be like, 'Hey, stop'.\"[133][138]\n\n\nDonaldson considers himself strictly apolitical, saying that \"I don't want to alienate Republicans and Democrats. ... I like having it where everyone can support charity. My goal is to feed hundreds of millions of people ... it would be very silly of me to alienate basically half of America.\"[133] On a podcast in September 2022, Donaldson has commented he would consider a run for president of the United States \"in like 20 years\", adding that the U.S. is \"due for younger presidents\".[139][140]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: a more detailed description of his popularity and public image. You can help by adding to it. *(October 2023)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast's large model gumball machine at Vidcon 2022\nOpinion polls have shown that Donaldson is one of the most well-liked YouTubers on the platform. A 2021 SurveyMonkey poll showed that 70% of respondents have a favorable view of him, compared to 12% who had an unfavorable view.[141] In 2023, *Time* listed him on their *Time 100* list; fellow YouTuber and former NASA engineer Mark Rober wrote on his entry: \"He's constantly raising the bar for creators whether it's through re-creating *Squid Game* in real life or paying for the eye surgeries of 1,000 blind people. He doesn't really understand small thinking or complacency. I don't know what he'll do 10 years down the road, but I know it won't be status quo.\"[142] In 2023, CBC News noted that MrBeast's \"viral videos have stoked a wide range of reaction, from acclaim for their altruism to controversy for perceived exploitation.\"[143]\n\n\nIn October 2018, *The Atlantic* published an article on Donaldson's history of using homophobic slurs.[61][144][145] The article stated that Donaldson, while still a teenager, had had a habit of referring to people as \"fags\" on Twitter and regularly treated being homosexual as a punchline in jokes and \"gay\" as an insult.[144] Donaldson later removed the tweets, and in 2021, a spokesperson for Donaldson said that the YouTuber had \"grown up and matured into someone that doesn't speak like that\".[146]\n\n\nIn 2023, Donaldson's childhood friend and employee, Kris (formerly Chris) Tyson, came out as transgender. When a critic tweeted that her transition would be a “nightmare” for the influencer, Donaldson replied, “Yeah, this is getting absurd. Chris isn’t my ‘nightmare’ he’s my friend and things are fine. All this transphobia is starting to piss me off.”[147][148][149]\n\n\nDuring a Clubhouse room in February 2021, Donaldson booted entrepreneur Farokh Sarmad after he allegedly said he could not pronounce his name, a move that Sarmad later said was racist. Sarmad's claims were questioned and denied by other Clubhouse users, who were present at the call who argued against Sarmad's claims, claiming that Donaldson removed him along with others to make room for women to be more inclusive.[150][151]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023\n | *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem* | Times Square Bystander\n |  | [152] |\n| *Under the Boardwalk* | Hot Sauce Crab\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Ceremony\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | 9th Streamy Awards | Breakout Creator\n | Won\n | [153] |\n| Ensemble Cast\n | Nominated\n |\n| Creator of the Year\n | Nominated\n |\n| 2020\n | 12th Annual Shorty Awards | YouTuber of the Year\n | Won\n |  |\n| 10th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [154][155] |\n| Live Special\n | Won\n |\n| Social Good: Creator\n | Won\n |\n| Social Good: Nonprofit or NGO\n | Won\n |\n| 2021\n | 2021 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Social Star\n | Nominated\n | [156] |\n| 11th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [157] |\n| 2022\n | 2022 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Creator\n | Won\n | [158] |\n| 12th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [159][160] |\n| Collaboration\n | Nominated\n |\n| Social Good: Creator[d] | Won\n |\n| Creator Product\n | Nominated\n |\n| Editing\n | Nominated\n |\n| Brand Engagement[d] | Won\n |\n| Social Impact Campaign[d] | Nominated\n |\n| 2023\n | 2023 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Creator\n | Won\n | [161] |\n| 13th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [162] |\n| Collaboration\n | Won\n |\n| Creator Product\n | Nominated\n |\n| Brand Engagement\n | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### World records[edit]\n\n\n\n\nName of publication, year the record was awarded, name of the record, and the name of the record holder\n| Publication\n | Year\n | World record\n | Record holder\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Guinness World Records* | 2021\n | Highest-earning YouTube contributor (current)\n | MrBeast\n | [163] |\n| 2022\n | Largest vegetarian burger\n | [164] |\n| Most subscribers for an individual male on YouTube\n | Jimmy Donaldson\n | [165] |\n| 2023\n | First person to reach 1 million followers on Threads | MrBeast\n | [166] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n* Night Media\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Only the six main channels are included: MrBeast, MrBeast Gaming, Beast Reacts, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts), Beast Philanthropy and MrBeast 3 (formerly MrBeast 2).\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sources conflict on the spelling of Donaldson's middle name.

He began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012, at the age of 13,[17] under the handle MrBeast6000. His early content ranged from Let's Plays to \"videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers\".[18] He went viral in 2017 after his \"counting to 100,000\" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views.[18] His videos, typically involving challenges and giveaways, became increasingly grand and extravagant.[19] Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired some of his childhood friends to co-run the brand. As of 2023, the MrBeast team is made up of over 250 people, including Donaldson himself.[20] Other than MrBeast, Donaldson runs the YouTube channels Beast Reacts, MrBeast Gaming, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts)[21] and the philanthropy channel Beast Philanthropy.[22][23] He formerly ran MrBeast 3 (initially MrBeast 2), which is now inactive.[24][25] As of 2023, he is the highest paid YouTuber,[26] and has an estimated net worth of $500 million.[27]\n\n\nDonaldson is the founder of MrBeast Burger and Feastables; and a co-creator of Team Trees, a fundraiser for the Arbor Day Foundation that has raised over $23 million;[28][29] and Team Seas, a fundraiser for Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup that has raised over $30 million.[30] Donaldson won the Creator of the Year award four times at the Streamy Awards in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023; he also won the Favorite Male Creator award twice at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, *Time* named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJames Stephen Donaldson[b] was born on May 7, 1998[31] in Wichita, Kansas.[32] He was mainly raised in Greenville, North Carolina with his brother CJ.[33][34] He moved often and was under the care of au pairs due to his parents working long hours and serving in the military. His parents divorced in 2007.[33] In 2016, Donaldson graduated from Greenville Christian Academy, a small private evangelical Christian high school in the area. He briefly attended East Carolina University before dropping out.[35][36]\n\n\n\n## YouTube career[edit]\n\n\n### Early viral attempts (2012–2017)[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson uploaded his first YouTube video in February 2012, at the age of 13, under the name of \"MrBeast6000\".[37] His early content ranged from Let's Plays, mainly focused on *Minecraft* and *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*,[37] videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,[38] videos that offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators and commentary on YouTube drama. Donaldson appeared infrequently in these videos.[37]\n\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Donaldson began to gain popularity with his \"Worst intros on YouTube\" series poking fun at YouTube video introductions.[37][39][40] By mid-2016, Donaldson had around 30,000 subscribers. In fall 2016, Donaldson dropped out of East Carolina University to pursue a full-time career as a YouTuber.[18][38] His mother did not approve of this and made him move out of the family home.[35]\n\n\nAs his channel grew, Donaldson hired four childhood friends – Kris Tyson (formerly Chris Tyson), Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds and Jake Franklin – to contribute to his channel.[35] They then contacted numerous YouTubers in order to obtain statistics of their successful videos and predict the platform's recommendation system.[41][*clarification needed*] Franklin left the crew in 2020. Afterwards, Karl Jacobs, previously a cameraman, was promoted to take his place.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n### Rise to fame (2017–2020)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast in 2018\nIn January 2017, Donaldson published an almost day-long video of himself counting to 100,000, which became his breakthrough viral video.[19] The ordeal took him 40 hours, with some parts sped up to \"keep it under 24 hours.\"[45] Donaldson gained popularity during this period with stunts, such as attempting to break glass using a hundred megaphones, watching paint dry for an hour,[36] attempting to stay underwater for 24 hours, which ended up failing due to health issues, and an unsuccessful attempt to spin a fidget spinner for a day.[46] By 2018, Donaldson had given out $1 million through his outlandish stunts, which earned him the title of \"YouTube's biggest philanthropist\".[35]\n\n\nDuring the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in 2018, a competition to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube, Donaldson bought billboards and numerous television and radio advertisements to help PewDiePie gain more subscribers than T-Series.[47][48] During Super Bowl LIII, he bought multiple seats for himself and his team, whose shirts spelled out \"Sub 2 PewDiePie.\"[49][50]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Donaldson organized and filmed a real-life battle royale competition in Los Angeles with a prize of $200,000 (two games were played, making game earnings of $100,000 for each game) in collaboration with *Apex Legends*.[51] The event and prize pool was sponsored by *Apex Legends* publisher Electronic Arts.[52]\n\n\nDonaldson was accused of using counterfeit money in his video titled \"I Opened A FREE BANK\", published on November 23, 2019.[35] He later explained that he used fake money to avoid participant safety concerns and that participants received real checks after the shoot.[35]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Donaldson created a rock, paper, scissors competition stream that featured 32 influencers and a grand prize of $250,000, which at the time became YouTube's most-watched live Original event with 662,000 concurrent viewers.[53] The event was won by Nadeshot.[54] In October 2020, Donaldson hosted another influencer tournament, this time trivia, featuring 24 competitors with a grand prize of $300,000. The tournament was won by siblings Charli and Dixie D'Amelio, which caused controversy due to claims that they cheated.[55]\n\n\n\n### Mainstream success (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jimmy Donaldson in 2021\nOn January 1, 2021, Donaldson released the video \"Youtube Rewind 2020, Thank God It's Over\".[56] In Donaldson's video, he explains that he had always believed that YouTubers \"should get more say in Rewind\", and with this in mind, he decided to call \"hundreds of YouTubers\".[56] At the end of the video, Donaldson gives a shout-out to PewDiePie, citing him and his 2018 Rewind as the inspiration for Donaldson's Rewind.[56] A month later, Donaldson signed a Facebook and Snapchat content distribution deal with Jellysmack.[57][58]\n\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards 2023\nIn November 2021, Donaldson uploaded \"$456,000 *Squid Game* in Real Life!\", a recreation of the survival drama streaming television series *Squid Game* in real life. The video had 456 people compete for a $456,000 cash prize.[59] The video was one of the most-watched YouTube videos of 2021, receiving over 130 million views within a week.[60] A review of the video in *Vice* argued that it \"badly misunderstood the anti-capitalist message of *Squid Game*\".[61] Despite this, *Squid Game* creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has reacted positively to recreations and parodies of the series.[62]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Donaldson created a third influencer tournament featuring 15 competitors with a grand prize of $1,000,000.[63][64][65] In January 2022, *Forbes* ranked Donaldson as YouTube's highest-earning creator, earning an estimated $54 million in 2021. *Forbes* stated that his income in 2021 would have placed him 40th in the 2020 Forbes Celebrity 100, earning as much money as Vin Diesel and Lewis Hamilton did in 2020.[66][67]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2022, Donaldson surpassed 100 million subscribers on his main channel, making him the fifth channel and the second individual YouTuber to achieve the milestone.[68][69] On November 17, 2022, Donaldson achieved the Guinness World Record of \"Most Subscribers for an Individual Male on YouTube\" with his MrBeast channel at 112,193,139 subscribers.[70] The previous record holder, PewDiePie, had held the record as the most subscribed YouTuber for almost ten years.[71] Donaldson achieved one billion video views over a period of 30 days on his main YouTube channel in November 2022.[72] On October 15th, 2023, Donaldson surpassed 200 million subscribers.[73]\n\n\n\n## YouTube content[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his career, Donaldson's content usually consisted of Let's Plays, \"best and worst\" videos and YouTube commentary.[74][37] Donaldson's present-day videos are categorized into three genres: stunt videos, where Donaldson or other participants perform challenges that are interesting, challenging, or dangerous; \"junklord\" videos, where Donaldson uses a large quantity of a particular product in an unusual way or spends an extravagant amount on it; and giveaway videos, where Donaldson gives away large amounts of money or extravagant prizes to people, usually including a competitive aspect.[c] Giveaway videos are considered to be a distinctive feature of Donaldson's content.[74]\n\n\nDonaldson's videos leverage YouTube's recommendation algorithm in order to go viral, mainly by maximizing click-through rate and viewer retention.[74] To maximize click-through rate, he focuses on creating effective topics, titles and thumbnails.[75] In an interview with Lex Fridman, he stated that for him to create a viral video, it needed to be \"original, creative, something people really need to see, ideally never been done before\".[76] His titles are designed to attract attention by promising outrageous stunts, and using certain keywords like \"24-hours\" and \"challenge\".[41][75] His thumbnails are designed to be easily understandable, clearly focused and brightly colored.[77] To maximize viewer retention, Donaldson paces the videos to have viewers engaged throughout. His videos typically span 10-20 minutes. He hooks viewers by explaining the premise in under half a minute at the start of the video,[41] and promises a \"finale\" to have viewers engaged until the end of the video.[74]\n\n\nDonaldson's funding for these videos mainly come from sponsorships and Google's AdSense program.[78] Donaldson was reported in 2022 to spend about $1 million on each video.[79] Although Donaldson's videos rarely turn a profit, he is concentrated more on expanding his YouTube channel rather than earning a profit, stating in an interview with *Rolling Stone*: \"I could be doing cheaper videos, [...] But I just don't want to. I want to push the boundaries to go bigger, bigger\".[79][80] Most of his funding come from sponsorships.[78] Donaldson uses his reaction channel and gaming channel to help finance his main channel, as their videos are relatively cheap to produce and make a substantial amount of money.[79] *The Verge* noted that his revenue is self-perpetuating: \"The more viral he becomes, the more brands want to work with him, and the bigger his own AdSense earnings get. He can then entice viewers with even bigger giveaway videos. It's a never ending cycle.\"[78] Donaldson earns passive income through merchandise, MrBeast Burger, and Feastables.[74][81]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Donaldson employs over 250 people.[82] They include writers, editors and production assistants. Many employees were people familiar to Donaldson, such as friends and family members.[83] Some former employees alleged that Donaldson nurtured a difficult work environment. In a May 2021 *New York Times* article, Matt Turner, an editor for Donaldson from February 2018 to September 2019, claimed that Donaldson berated him almost daily, including calling him a \"retard\". Turner reported that he was regularly not credited for his work.[83] Reporting by *Insider* showed that Turner previously posted a video in 2018 explaining his allegations, and in October 2019 released a deleted Twitter thread which stated that he was \"yelled at, bullied, called mentally retarded and replaceable by Donaldson every single day.\"[84] Nate Anderson, another editor, quit after working for Donaldson for a week in 2018 over what he said were unreasonable demands, and called Donaldson a perfectionist. After releasing a video describing his experience, Anderson reportedly received death threats from Donaldson's fans. Nine other employees who worked for Donaldson also stated that while he was sometimes generous, his demeanor would change when the cameras were off.[83][84] Donaldson disputes these claims, stating: \"We have high standards, but it’s not a toxic work environment.\"[79] Donaldson also claims that he gave Turner $10,000 and suggested a job at another company to him at the end of his contract.\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Finger on the App[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Donaldson, in collaboration with Brooklyn-based art collective MSCHF, released a one-time multiplayer mobile game titled *Finger on the App*. In the game, players touch their phone screen and the last person to remove their finger from the screen wins $25,000.[85] In the end, four people ended up winning $20,000 each after keeping their finger on the app for over 70 hours.[86] The game was reportedly so successful that a sequel titled *Finger on the App 2* was planned to originally launch in December 2020. The game was postponed to February, and then further delayed to March 2021 due to a flood of downloads, causing the game to crash and requiring the game's developers to upgrade their servers. This time, the game featured a grand prize of $100,000.[87] The winner kept their finger on the phone screen for around 51 hours. The second-place finisher also received a prize of $20,000.[88]\n\n\n\n### MrBeast Burger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MrBeast Burger\n\n![](image)A MrBeast Burger restaurant in New Jersey\nWill Hyde, a producer for the MrBeast channel, announced in a November 2020 article with *The Wake Weekly* that Donaldson would launch a virtual restaurant called MrBeast Burger in December 2020. Hyde said his team worked with Virtual Dining Concepts during the development of the restaurant concept. He said that MrBeast Burger will sell franchise rights to serve the burgers to restaurants across the U.S. and customers will be able to order the burgers via online delivery services.[89]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Donaldson announced that he would bring a MrBeast Burger shop to the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey, near New York City, to be the location of his first U.S. restaurant. The restaurant opened on September 4, 2022.[90]\n\n\nOn June 17, 2023, Donaldson expressed wishes to shut down MrBeast Burger due to fears that quality cannot be guaranteed, saying he regrets signing \"a bad deal\" with Virtual Dining Concepts, LLC, but said the company \"won't let me stop even though it's terrible for my brand.\"[91][92][93] On July 31, 2023, Donaldson sued Virtual Dining Concepts to end their partnership, alleging that the company damaged his reputation by prioritizing the expansion of the MrBeast Burger brand over food quality. Donaldson also claimed he received no payment from the partnership.[94][95] Virtual Dining Concepts disputed the claims, stating Donaldson had grown his reputation due to the MrBeast Burger brand, and accused Donaldson of attempting a new deal for personal gain and resorting to \"bullying\" when rejected.[96]\n\n\n\n### Feastables[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Feastables\n\n![](image)Feastables Bar\nIn January 2022, Donaldson announced the creation of a new food company called Feastables, which launched with its own brand of chocolate bars called \"MrBeast Bars\". At launch they offered three flavors of bars: original, almond and quinoa crunch. The launch corresponded with a sweepstakes with over $1 million in prizes, including ten grand prize winners who would receive a chance to compete for a chocolate factory in a future video, emulating *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*.[97] The video, released in June 2022, contained a series of elimination challenges where the winner won the choice of the chocolate factory or a $500,000 cash prize. Michelin Star chef Gordon Ramsay featured as a judge in the final challenge of the video and ultimately decided who won the cash prize.[98][99] Feastables reportedly made $10 million in its first few months of operation.[100]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2023, Donaldson asked fans on Twitter to \"clean up the presentation\" of Feastables displays on store shelves, and suggested that they obscure competing products. Feastables offered fans entry into a $5,000 raffle if they provided proof of their assistance. The tweets drew criticism and accusations that Feastables was exploiting fans for unpaid labor.[101][102]\n\n\nOn October 2, 2023, Feastables signed a partnership with the Charlotte Hornets to include MrBeast's insignia on their jerseys.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Investments and partnerships[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson is an investor in the tech startup Backbone, which produces the Backbone One, a controller that makes smartphones appear more similar to Nintendo Switch controllers, and the Backbone app, a content creation and social tools app for its users.[105][106]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Donaldson partnered with Creative Juice financial network to introduce Juice Funds, a $2 million investment fund for content creators.[107][83]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Donaldson became a long-term investor and partner of financial technology company Current.[108][109] The same month, Donaldson received backlash after fans lost large amounts of money in a cryptocurrency scheme that Donaldson had invested in and promoted.[83]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Donaldson partnered with East Carolina University to create a course centered around YouTube content creation.[110][111]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Donaldson featured as a judge on Gordon Ramsay's *Food Stars* show.[112]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n### Team Trees[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Team Trees\n\n![](image)Team Trees\nOn October 25, 2019, Donaldson and former NASA engineer and YouTuber Mark Rober announced a collaborative fundraising challenge event on YouTube called #TeamTrees. The goal of this project was to raise $20 million for the Arbor Day Foundation by January 1, 2020, and plant trees \"no later than December 2022.\" Every donation goes to the Arbor Day Foundation, which pledges to plant one tree for every dollar donated. Notable YouTubers such as Rhett & Link, Marshmello, iJustine, Marques Brownlee, The Slow Mo Guys, Ninja, Simone Giertz, Jacksepticeye and Smarter Every Day brought attention to the project, and trees began to be planted in October 2019 in US national parks.[113][114]\n\n\nOn December 19 of that year, the $20,000,000 goal was surpassed.[115] The project has received large donations from corporate executives Jack Dorsey, Susan Wojcicki, Elon Musk[116] and Tobias Lütke,[117] as well as from companies such as Discovery, Verizon and Plants vs. Zombies.[118] Tobias Lütke, founder and CEO of Shopify, holds the record for the highest donation at 1,000,001 trees planted.[119] As of February 11, 2023, the original goal of 20 million trees has been far surpassed, with over 24.3 million trees in the ground.[120]\n\n\n\n### Beast Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greenville received Thanksgiving meals as part of an initiative by Beast Philanthropy and Jennie-O.[121][122]\nOn September 17, 2020, the YouTube channel Beast Philanthropy was created.[123] On the channel's first video, Donaldson announced the charity and food bank and named Darren Margolias, who had appeared in previous videos, as executive director.[24][124] According to the channel description, 100% of its advertising revenue, brand deals and merchandise sales are donated to charity.[19][123]\n\n\nNotable initiatives by Beast Philanthropy include giving away 10,000 turkeys to his hometown Greenville,[121][122] donating 20,000 shoes to children in Africa,[125] and gifting $300,000 worth of technology to various schools.[126]\n\n\n\n### Team Seas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Team Seas\n\n![](image)Team Seas\nOn October 29, 2021, Donaldson and Rober organized another collaborative challenge event on YouTube titled #TeamSeas. The goal of this project was to raise $30 million for the Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup by January 1, 2022. The $30 million goal would fund the removal of 30 million pounds of plastic and other waste from oceans, rivers, and beaches. Donaldson and Rober enlisted thousands of content creators, including AzzyLand, DanTDM, TommyInnit, LinusTechTips, TierZoo, LEMMiNO, The Infographics Show, Hannah Stocking, Dhar Mann and Marques Brownlee, and partnered with BEN and TubeBuddy's initiative of eight million global creators, to promote the fundraiser.[127][128][129]\n\n\n\n### Cataract surgery[edit]\n\n\nIn a video published in January 2023 titled \"1,000 Blind People See For The First Time\", Donaldson paid for cataract surgery for a thousand people who had severely limited vision and had been unable to afford the procedure.[130] Responses to his video on the subject ranged from praise at its intention to spread awareness to criticism that he was creating \"charity porn\" motivated solely by profit.[131] Other comments criticized the American medical system for failing to provide the necessary healthcare to the patients in the video, questioning why patients had to rely on a YouTuber for the procedure.[132]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson describes himself as an introvert. Donaldson admits to having difficulty maintaining a social life due to his obsession with YouTube and his intense work ethic. Donaldson's mother, Sue, attributes his withdrawn lifestyle to their frequent relocations and his struggles with Crohn's disease.[133]\n\n\nDonaldson dated Maddy Spidell, a YouTuber, from 2019 to 2022. He has dated Thea Booysen, a gaming streamer, since 2022.[134][135]\n\n\nIn June 2023, Donaldson stated that he was invited to go on a tourist expedition to view the wreck of the *Titanic* in the OceanGate submersible *Titan* but declined the offer.[136] The submersible imploded in the Atlantic Ocean, killing all five aboard.[137]\n\n\n\n### Personal views[edit]\n\n\nIn an April 2022 interview with *The Daily Beast*, Donaldson announced that he was no longer an evangelical Christian and identified himself as an agnostic. He also stated that he had long disagreed with the church's position on homosexuality. He states that during the time he grew up in \"the heart of the Bible Belt\", he had religion \"beat into [his] head every day\", and was taught that \"gay people are the reason God's going to come and burn this Earth\". Although he considered anti-LGBT rhetoric to be normal growing up, he has disavowed it since then, stating: \"I realized, 'Oh, this isn't normal. This is just a weird place I grew up in.' So, that type of thing, I [wish I could] go back in time and be like, 'Hey, stop'.\"[133][138]\n\n\nDonaldson considers himself strictly apolitical, saying that \"I don't want to alienate Republicans and Democrats. ... I like having it where everyone can support charity. My goal is to feed hundreds of millions of people ... it would be very silly of me to alienate basically half of America.\"[133] On a podcast in September 2022, Donaldson has commented he would consider a run for president of the United States \"in like 20 years\", adding that the U.S. is \"due for younger presidents\".[139][140]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: a more detailed description of his popularity and public image. You can help by adding to it. *(October 2023)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast's large model gumball machine at Vidcon 2022\nOpinion polls have shown that Donaldson is one of the most well-liked YouTubers on the platform. A 2021 SurveyMonkey poll showed that 70% of respondents have a favorable view of him, compared to 12% who had an unfavorable view.[141] In 2023, *Time* listed him on their *Time 100* list; fellow YouTuber and former NASA engineer Mark Rober wrote on his entry: \"He's constantly raising the bar for creators whether it's through re-creating *Squid Game* in real life or paying for the eye surgeries of 1,000 blind people. He doesn't really understand small thinking or complacency. I don't know what he'll do 10 years down the road, but I know it won't be status quo.\"[142] In 2023, CBC News noted that MrBeast's \"viral videos have stoked a wide range of reaction, from acclaim for their altruism to controversy for perceived exploitation.\"[143]\n\n\nIn October 2018, *The Atlantic* published an article on Donaldson's history of using homophobic slurs.[61][144][145] The article stated that Donaldson, while still a teenager, had had a habit of referring to people as \"fags\" on Twitter and regularly treated being homosexual as a punchline in jokes and \"gay\" as an insult.[144] Donaldson later removed the tweets, and in 2021, a spokesperson for Donaldson said that the YouTuber had \"grown up and matured into someone that doesn't speak like that\".[146]\n\n\nIn 2023, Donaldson's childhood friend and employee, Kris (formerly Chris) Tyson, came out as transgender. When a critic tweeted that her transition would be a “nightmare” for the influencer, Donaldson replied, “Yeah, this is getting absurd. Chris isn’t my ‘nightmare’ he’s my friend and things are fine. All this transphobia is starting to piss me off.”[147][148][149]\n\n\nDuring a Clubhouse room in February 2021, Donaldson booted entrepreneur Farokh Sarmad after he allegedly said he could not pronounce his name, a move that Sarmad later said was racist. Sarmad's claims were questioned and denied by other Clubhouse users, who were present at the call who argued against Sarmad's claims, claiming that Donaldson removed him along with others to make room for women to be more inclusive.[150][151]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023\n | *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem* | Times Square Bystander\n |  | [152] |\n| *Under the Boardwalk* | Hot Sauce Crab\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Ceremony\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | 9th Streamy Awards | Breakout Creator\n | Won\n | [153] |\n| Ensemble Cast\n | Nominated\n |\n| Creator of the Year\n | Nominated\n |\n| 2020\n | 12th Annual Shorty Awards | YouTuber of the Year\n | Won\n |  |\n| 10th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [154][155] |\n| Live Special\n | Won\n |\n| Social Good: Creator\n | Won\n |\n| Social Good: Nonprofit or NGO\n | Won\n |\n| 2021\n | 2021 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Social Star\n | Nominated\n | [156] |\n| 11th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [157] |\n| 2022\n | 2022 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Creator\n | Won\n | [158] |\n| 12th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [159][160] |\n| Collaboration\n | Nominated\n |\n| Social Good: Creator[d] | Won\n |\n| Creator Product\n | Nominated\n |\n| Editing\n | Nominated\n |\n| Brand Engagement[d] | Won\n |\n| Social Impact Campaign[d] | Nominated\n |\n| 2023\n | 2023 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Creator\n | Won\n | [161] |\n| 13th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [162] |\n| Collaboration\n | Won\n |\n| Creator Product\n | Nominated\n |\n| Brand Engagement\n | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### World records[edit]\n\n\n\n\nName of publication, year the record was awarded, name of the record, and the name of the record holder\n| Publication\n | Year\n | World record\n | Record holder\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Guinness World Records* | 2021\n | Highest-earning YouTube contributor (current)\n | MrBeast\n | [163] |\n| 2022\n | Largest vegetarian burger\n | [164] |\n| Most subscribers for an individual male on YouTube\n | Jimmy Donaldson\n | [165] |\n| 2023\n | First person to reach 1 million followers on Threads | MrBeast\n | [166] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n* Night Media\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Only the six main channels are included: MrBeast, MrBeast Gaming, Beast Reacts, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts), Beast Philanthropy and MrBeast 3 (formerly MrBeast 2).\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sources conflict on the spelling of Donaldson's middle name.
